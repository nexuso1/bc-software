        "10":"SAVA Discussion and some tard's TA  WADDUP TARDS!\n\n10 days ago, I made a TA post about WISH and the stonk blew past my expectations. Had anyone entered when I made the post, you'd be up bigly. But to the $wishtards that bought in the 9s+, you have my sympathies.\n\nWell, it's time for another play. $SAVA baby!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nLet me preface by saying I'm 200 shares long, and will not sell any even in the short-term. I believe in the company and the science behind their drug, simufilam. Shit's going to be worth tons in the next 2-3 years.\n\nRecently, the company was targeted by nefarious short sellers. The stock's price got destroyed, but that's a good thing for new investors because it gives you the opportunity to get in at a cheap price. And, if you break down the short sellers\/critics points, you'd know how much of manipulators they are and how fucked this system is, but that's beside the point. The shorts are going to be in pain.\n\nThe company's board sold no shares even at the top, so there's a clear belief on their part in their company. This gave me a ton of confidence, frankly. But, the data behind the drug's efficacy is astounding. It gives me more confidence, and some semblance of hope for people with Alzheimer's. When this shit gets approved by the FDA and Biden gets a chance at maintaining his sanity through simufilam, then the stock will go berserk. You know how GME went berserk? I'm not saying this is the next GME cause there will be nothing like GME in such a short span of time, but SAVA will be madness too. I think Burry had spoken about their correlation being like 90% or so. Currently, the short interest is sitting somewhere in the 25-30% as of today.\n\nOkay, anyways, besides my little rant. Here's my TA for the short-term:\n\nChart on the daily:\n\n[ Looks a little ugly, but let's open the indicators ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/jz8a1l7ih0v71.png?width=1026&format=png&auto=webp&s=2adea2c54b3f81372da32cbe2e31812f3a71010f)\n\nTwo indicators are screaming at me to buy: The Money Flow Index (MFI) and the Relative Strength Index (RSI). See it looping at the bottom there... well as it'll loop up, the price will loop up. That's how my smooth brain works, and so should yours when you believe in the astrology of charts.\n\n[ MFI and RSI going up up and away](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/o1ey5nwoh0v71.png?width=1021&format=png&auto=webp&s=e5b4aa373edbfec9ec43d2554dc20b48c0f420cb)\n\nOn the 4hr chart, I'm getting bullish signals too from the RSI. There's also a solid trendline hinting, more or less, that we've bottomed out in the short term.\n\n[ \\\\\"Gimme the loop\\\\\" - Notorious BIG](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/fk4oao1th0v71.png?width=1022&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd89abec65664359ccd9a4471d7e0c8f39ba3a98)\n\nA similar move to that in Sept would put us back in the 80 dollar range, and the RSI on the daily would still have more room up. So, shit could even blow the 80 dollar mark, considering earnings is soon and we might hear some good news regarding a partnership.\n\n[ Twins of Gains](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/xdcatv0wh0v71.png?width=1022&format=png&auto=webp&s=46846c474c07aae8a3ed8db5b072b5bf863c3fa9)\n\nLastly, the MACD and STOCH's are also signalling bullish in the short term.\n\nThe stochs are in undersold territory, and the blue line is going above the red line. So, two outcomes here: 1) we could hang around here for a little bit then blast up (which would be good if you want to accumulate shares for cheap) or 2) we get a quick correction where the blue line takes off like a fucking meme rocket.\n\n[Outcome 1 shown on the stochs and price](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/iaiopw7yh0v71.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3c92d82c675d96a71374dc751aedc0620fec2ec)\n\nThe MACD on the 1hr timeframe is also just coming out of a correction, so I'm expecting upwards movement on the price for at least for a couple of days. \n\n[ Macdonalds](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/5wqc4pf2i0v71.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6748a9cc659ac55024b9d5605860677e4a5429d)\n\nIf you aren't convinced bye my stupidity yet, check back in a week or two on the price and thank me.

        "11":"THe Next Great Meme: Wework The Next Great Meme- Wework \n\nThe Invisible Hand \n1) The stock market is essentially that a marketplace, buyers and sellers. Prices move up and down depending on whatever whoever is willing to pay. If a stock rises so much sellers come in and drop the price, if it falls to much buyers come in and pick up the price. If every single person puts a $100 order for a $1 stock but there are no selling orders $100 is the new price. Every other thing you hear about the market are attempts at justification for those prices, cashflow discount, dividend discount, P\/E, EPS, all mumbo jumbo to try to make sense of why A trades for more than B. It is also why you see \u201cMEME\u201d stocks trade at traditional mind boggling prices\/valuations, because it just boils down to what someone is willing to pay for those shares and the majority agree that AMC should trade north of $35 and GME over $150.\n\n Making a MEME\n\nThere are a few key points that contribute into turning a stock into a MEME Stock. The stock must be recognizable to have staying power. In order for the MEME to stay a MEME and hold its price, it has to be a company people have heard about or MSM (Main Street Media) have or will cover heavily. Secondly America loves a Comeback, and so does the market\/Members, the stock has to be heavily beat down if a narrative about how its business was destroyed by Covid that\u2019s a double plus. Finally the stock has to have a very low float or highly shorted, I would contend the first point is magnitudes more important. With these 3 points in our mind lets dive into who the target is. \n\nFrankenstein\u2019s Monster \n\nWework was once a shining Jewel in the Softbank investment portfolio, investing at least $18.5 billion in WeWork since 2017, including $6 billion when a fundraising round valued the startup at $47 billion in January 2019(1). But governance and profitability concerns in addition to a disaster IPO lead to their $47B valuation getting chopped down to nearly $10B in oct 2019 (2). Over this time MSM loves to take about WeWork it was a darling that got absolutely obliterated, can you imagine if it went on a monster AMC\/GME run, point 1 check. Wework\u2019s primary business is real estate, they buy\/renovate office space and then sublease this same workspace to multiple companies or share of whole offices for 1 largely customer. Covid19 has dramatically changed the work\/life balance, we are going on almost 2 years of the pandemic where most white collar has been done remotely or at home. Now with labor holding a lot of the cards the ability to work from anywhere for at least for 2-3 a week the traditional office model is being disrupted. A fundamental argument can be made that WeWork\u2019s business is about to experience a renaissance driven by the Covid 19 pandemic as corporation adopt smaller satellite offices since more staff can work remotely or at home. If you watch CNBC you may have caught David Faber mention the \u201cSPAC POP\u201d which is a sudden increase in the SPAC price when the deal closes due to a large 95 or greater percent redemption of space shares. Due to point 1 and 2 I expect the \/Wework Spac to have an insanely high redemption rate maybe 98%, this will result in a super low float. \n\n\n\nGamma Gameplan \n\nOne of the most potent tools in the MEME trader arsenal is the long naked call option. The call option gives you the right but not the obligation to purchase 100 shares at a price you choose. A market maker sells you this call for a premium which is determined by a number of factors such as length of time, difference in price, volatility of the stock, etc. Now MM\u2019s have a number of ways they can neutralize the risk to selling these options, 1 of which is buying the underlying stock, so that as the stock rises so does their share price thus offsetting their losses. The other option would be buying a higher strike so cap their losses. I believe a GAMMA Blitz can be executed around the SPAC POP in order to drive the stock price up. For Example the vote to close the Wework SPAC is set for Oct 19, if passed Wework shares will start to trade on Oct 21. The nearest call option for  is the Nov 19 call with the highest strike being the 17.5. If enough of these calls are sold there is currently no higher strike for MM\u2019s to hedge with, they would have to buy the underlying stock to cover themselves, but this will move the price significantly since the float will be dramatically reduced due to the high redemption. \n\nI am targeting a share price over $20 by Nov 1st. This is not financial advice or a call to action, I am simply sharing my thoughts and ideas, please invest\/trade at your own discretion.",

        "24":"Citadel and Susquehanna's Short Play on Tilray I want to highlight one of Citadel's and Susquehanna's recent short plays as new 13F filings indicates they are making a large short play on Tilray (TLRY).\n\nThere's been a few discussions on WSB along with several other Subs on questionable price actions on a number of stocks including TLRY. A good amount of these questionable price actions can be spotted just by looking at the 1-minute to 5-minute price charts with volume. You can see that volume is generally consistent throughout the day but as the price gets closer to a major support price level, sudden extremely large sell orders tend to appear out of nowhere just to push the price through support and then suddenly disappear. I started to notice this issue for TLRY about 2 months ago as it wasn't the case earlier. \n\nI sense that this has to do with short sellers so I started to do a little digging and this is what I have found: \n\n[Yes, Citadel is involved](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/5ndscitmpvq71.png?width=1681&format=png&auto=webp&s=1585a48c981e8a67d2651a38e98c85c8fba624bc)\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/pb2a11dopvq71.png?width=1624&format=png&auto=webp&s=e5c88604ec72975d95b17b6aba7534ebd85627b3\n\nAs indicated above, both Citadel and Susquehanna have started taking large short positions in TLRY. Keep in mind that these companies are required to file 13Fs within 45 days of their transactions and as these numbers were only the disclosures in August (Which was when these mini sell volume spikes started), the total short interest amounts could currently be considerably higher. It is also publicly known that institutional short sellers have been reducing their short positions before short interest filing dates and increasing back their short positions after the filing date in order to stay under the radar. Who wants to bet that these guys are actually doing that? \n\nKeep in mind this is also a double edged sword, as they will be more vulnerable to a short squeeze. \n\nI also want to highlight that Bank of America this morning just randomly downgraded CGC (One of Tilray's Top Peers) pushing the entire sector down. This is at the same time when other analysts actually upgraded CGC which makes BOA's rating stand out quite a bit. As you can see BOA above just started to increase its short positions in Tilray in August as well. \n\nIt seems that TLRY is the biggest target in the public cannabis space since it is the most liquid and actually traded on a real American exchange with the largest volume in the space. This is why even though nothing but good news is coming out of Tilray and the cannabis sector overall, the stock goes down on times when it shouldn't. \n\nThese are the people are you are playing against and as we know from stocks like GME or AMC, companies like Citadel just don't play fair.",
        "27":"DOLE: \"There's always [tendies] in the banana stand\" (DD) Alright reta...oh fuck, it's been a few months.., I mean apes. I'm back with a play you all can relate to...but first, here's the summary and re-introduction.\n\n**TL;DR:** Dole just went public, trades cheaply vs. peers, and sells bananas, other fruits, and veggies. Apes eat all of the above. Options just opened up two weeks ago and will accelerate the multiple re-rating as institutions and apes buy DOLE and the multiple normalizes, share price rises, and we all enjoy tendie flavored bananas over the coming months\/years.\n\n**About me:** Some OGs (as in, pre-January mania) may remember me as the **GMEdd** dot com **$169.42 PT** guy that was invested in GME for longer than our friend u\/DeepFuckingValue and made several podcasts + appearances on Bloomberg, Benzinga, etc. I shared some DD with WSB [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/k34e7x\/gme_yolo_roth_ira\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/kknuk6\/gme_icr_conference_words_matter\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/krdqp5\/gme_4q20_financial_model_update\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) etc...you get the fucking point. We all know how that story played out in January, many early entrants were rewarded with [life-changing tendies](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/l93d18\/gme_og_team_uberkikz11_update\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)..., alas many late entrants were also fukt by Vlad et al, such is life. \n\nBack to the play that really ripened my banana. We're talking about a literal ape play: the world's largest producer of fresh produce, newly IPOed Dole Plc. (DOLE):\n\n[North American & European exposure to Bananas & Various Fruits & Vegetables](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/gwqt341udcq71.png?width=1168&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e8bfd8b5037afe214b1f627290b6fbe59c20bf7)\n\n[Share Leader in Key Categories; Growth Opportunity in Higher Margin Value-Added Produce](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/5abh528ydcq71.png?width=626&format=png&auto=webp&s=00eb4fbc38da6b89aebb19d472d7dd8adf18e9ac)\n\nFor those of you care about the details, dig into this [excellent analysis by ValueSits](https:\/\/valuesits.substack.com\/p\/total-produce-plc-dole-food-company) laying out the entire landscape. I'll translate a few key points into ret...ape:\n\n* Dole Plc, global #1 player in fresh produce by a wide margin, is the product of a merger between Total Produce Plc and Dole Food Company that then went public to refinance & de-lever combined entity's debt\n* Upside opportunity ranges from 2x-3x current levels in 12-24 months, while downside risk appears limited, around the \\~$14\/share level  \n* Synergies expected to improve combined Dole Plc's EBITDA by \\~10%, with mid single digit growth going forward. **At its core this is a mispriced security, not a growth play.**\n\nSo there we have it; Dole returned to public markets two months ago on the back of a merger with UK based Total Produce that has yielded an absolute King Kong-sized player, currently priced like Diddy. The IPO went poorly, trading down \\~9%, and the price closed yesterday at $15.02. Why might the IPO have gone poorly?\n\n* IPO fatigue (IPO volumes this year on track to surpass the dotcom peak of $97B, per Renaissance Capital, in particular volumes were elevated around Dole's IPO (\\~$10B that week alone)\n* Weak investor roadshow and IPO occurred during a quiet Summer period\n* Apes were not given a lifetime supply of bananas for being part of the IPO (okay, not really)\n\nNow Uberkikz11, you may ask, why will the price go higher? Institutional ownership is low and will rise over time as Dole will be eligible for inclusion in the Russell 2000 and S&P Small Cap 600 indices with its current \\~$1.4B market cap. This plays out over the next year. Also, options trading opened less than two weeks ago, and has extremely low open interest and implied volatility... if apes go bananas, well, the re-rating will go ever faster. Notably, I pointed this out to some GME OGs yesterday and it appears that option volume has already begun to rise, with more calls traded yesterday than since options trading began. I'm sure it's nothing.\n\n[S&P Capital IQ shows \\~13&#37; Institutional Ownership, to Rise Upon Index Inclusion](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/jtfl4mxbgcq71.png?width=2830&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6e4db79e03675ce05d05d14ea106361a683c1af)\n\n[Options trading has just opened up, with a cheap IV by WSB standards](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/lcs3zj8zccq71.png?width=2680&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed08d2acb9f6bcb2e1b7cd1e449288dbf6195b0b)\n\n[Significant Discount to Peer Group Expected to Close Over Time](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/1utxczmdjcq71.png?width=861&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e6ee02967d441a46b05f97583f2e374896ee7cb)\n\nA few other points:\n\n* Analyst coverage is just getting underway, and so far 12mo price targets range from $15-$26\/share\n* Inflation risk is minimal as the vertically integrated DOLE will pass through costs to end buyers (retailers, wholesalers)... indeed, with its scale advantage I expect DOLE to outperform smaller peers in this regard\n* Prior IPOs of US listed produce businesses saw material re-ratings within the first 12 months: Mission Produce rose from 11.1x to \\~15x in 4 months from Oct20 to Feb21 and Lamb Weston listed at 7.5x rising to \\~15x in five months.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll that said, I took a large initial position yesterday: **5000 shares and 50 May22 $15C**.

It\u2019s the reason why we apes are infamous, it\u2019s the reason why short-sellers cower in fear when they hear our names, it\u2019s the reason why we are Wall Street Bets. \n\nWell, what if I told you, there was a new kid on the block. Just like the younger version of our poster boy, he\u2019s shy but a quiet achiever. All the Wall Street cucks underestimate him, ridicule him for his beta stature, arrogantly assume he will never amount to anything. They haven\u2019t seen nothing yet.\n\nLet me introduce you to GME\u2019s son, Scorpio Tankers.\n\nUnlike many Gamestop wannabes, Scorpio Tankers inherits fundamental traits of operating leverage and strong tailwinds reminiscent of those exhibited during his father\u2019s youth. Basically, this young man has been dealt the best hand on the river and is all in. \n\nSo bear with me a second as I go into the finer details.\n\nAs a leading shipping company, Scorpio has the young muscle of 131 vessels with an average age of 5.5 years. These naval elites are equipped with scrubbers and require little to no maintenance meaning Scorpio doesn\u2019t have to pay for the expensive low-sulfur fuel and make large capital purchases. Why does that matter? Well, it wouldn't mean much if vessel supply satisfied demand, but as fate has it, Scorpio is positioned in the largest supply shock ever witnessed in the industry. \n\nThere are few reasons why oil exporters will be paying hand over fist for Scorpio\u2019s services:\n\n1. Inventory Shortage: Nations across the globe are experiencing shortages of oil due to heightened demand from lockdown easing and increased consumption. \n2. Dislocation of Refineries: Various refineries which require crude oil to produce gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel has closed down indefinitely during covid leaving only those in the middle east operating. As most consumer nations are across the Atlantic, it serves to reason that seaborne imports of refined products will be needed to satisfy their domestic consumption. Not to mention increased seaborne imports of crude oil caused by refinery runs in consumer countries.\n3. Arbitrage opportunities: East-West Diesel Spreads have continued to widen leading to more physical arbitrage for diesel, and therefore an increased demand for seaborne transportation. \n4. The Almighty Supply Shock: Recent IMO 2020 regulations have forced vessels to use scrubbers or low-sulfur fuel oil. Both of these are expensive as f\\*\\*k and older vessels are just not worth using anymore. So long story short, most of the older vessels are getting scrapped and there ain\u2019t nobody to take their place. Supply growth is sub 1% for the next two years and that means we get the motherload. \n\nSo how much are we looking at?\n\nAt best we make 1 billion in FCF per year for at least three years covering all debt and leaving space for distribution. At worst we end up receiving fair value.\n\nOkay, but what is the upside?\n\nThat\u2019s the kicker.\n\nSee Scorpio also possesses the explosive genes of buybacks and the notorious gamma squeeze. \n\nWith 1 billion in FCF, first comes the paydown of debt, then comes the buyback, which brings the rally in the underlying price. Add options into the picture, and well you know the rest. \n\nAt a 1 billion market cap and 1 billion in net debt, all we need is two years, and we\u2019ve made our money back and the sky's the limit. It is as simple as that.\n\nFood for thought. \n\nScorpio\u2019s reign is upon us. Let us apes unite!\n\nS.S.S\n\nP.S. 250 mil in buybacks already initiated and 3-5 Bil NAV",
        "30":"A Bears Guide to Shorting Stupid Meme Stocks Lately, we've had a lot of P&D type stock activity, with a fast run up, and then a total bleed out. Su\\*\\*\\*rt dot com was one of these, as were any number of garbage SPACs. Kodak was one of the original best examples of this. These are usually pumped by suspicious accounts, with lots of award giving to get them to the top, and then unceremoniously dump later if they do pump. What they all have in common is very small float, and this is a very tradeable weakness for a bear.\n\nMy view is that spotting that something will pump is pretty tricky. Even if gamma is set up right, and the float is tiny usually on some sort of absurd mega short squeeze thesis, it may just not happen. However, it's VERY easy to spot something once it has pumped on a thin float. From there, you'll see the usual pumpers out there declaring it will go another 300% or whatever. But the best trade on these is to figure out when the float will increase, and confirm that the new float constitutes motivated sellers. If you can confirm when, and have a good theory for why people will sell from insane prices, you have a rock solid position to buy puts on (and can choose ITM or OTM depending on the particulars, but always with some buffer on timing). You usually have hours or days to position after this knowledge has become public, as was the case with IRNT earlier this week (That is still in progress, by the way...). Kodak gave you a full 3 weeks to play it. The scammy \"clean\" \"alternative currency\" company also gave you two days. It's a consistent source of bear wealth.\n\nSo how do you spot this? Well, here's a hint from the SEC:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Sage wisdom for the ages RH](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/srdg17c8wpp71.png?width=915&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba94afb89234618ad24ab5360dc7fcb036dfacb2)\n\nHow? God forbid, but you of course subscribe to SEC filings alerts and know what you are looking for! Nothign better than waking up and seeing your inbox with the catalyst that justifies yoloing half your account on one of these shorts.\n\n1. For that scammy company that ends in 'port dot com' and which no longer can be traded as such, they announced their merger timing. You could argue that the merger itself was sell the news (And it was), but once they declared what date the merger would happen, bears had a full two days to sell the shit out of the stock. Sure it dropped, but no where like it did after the merger completed and the float shot up 10x or something!\n2. For Kodak, note holders declared they converted their interest-earning bonds into stock. Gee, why would they do that when they can do it whenever? to sell of course. And sell they did - over a 3 week period, relentlessly. People said the IV on those puts was too high. It wasn't. It was a bargain.\n3. For IRNT, they just filed their s-1. Everyone knows once the S-1 gets an EFFECT statement from the SEC, the PIPE shares, and I think the warrants too, become unlocked. That's an average of 8 days. So positioning a few weeks out on this one is also a win in plain sight, since a 10x or more increase in the float will cause a ton of selling.\n\nI'm sure there will be more gifts like this. There's a committed group of people that think every stock is like GME, and want to BELIEVE that just once they will catch it. They predictably get scammed into running it up, and will hold the bag too long, and all the while keep posting updates on short interest, and talking about how much they'll screw the hedge funds, and all that other garbage. Betting against their faith is a losing proposition. They can go a while and as they say, ain\u2019t selling. However, betting that a huge increase in float will wipe out the stock price is just smart, because some of those new longs WILL be selling. And that's the play you can make over and over as a bear right now.\n\nLastly, some bear theory for everyone. Normally, stocks are bought and sold on value. But Meme stocks are not. They are bought and sold on level of net hype, divided in a sense by float. A lot of meme traders show up with intent to buy - they don't care the price - they just put in however many bucks they are going to put in. Traders can try to trade these stocks by measuring hype changes and thinking about buy rumor\/sell news, etc. That can work, but is quite difficult. I'd always rather have a sure thing. And if you know a stock is going to get some number of dollars in daily that stabilize it at a price, you can make a pretty informed bet that it's going to be a ton lower if the float is a lot bigger just on this model of how the stock is priced. Why? because those new longs aren't needing to buy, they have been able to do that all along! But they might want to sell with shares that just became unlocked...\n\nYes, I am short IRNT.

        "36":"What happened to Nokia $NOK after January 2021 meme hype? Crowds were going wild for $NOK in January and the mania lasted for three days before Robinhood halted the trading. $NOK boss fight was about to start after $GME, $AMC, $BB, had shown the way. In one day the share price peaked from $4.73 to $9.79. Buyers refused to listen bears explaining that the 5.6 billion share count was too high to move $NOK. Instead they kept buying hitting 1.2 billion volume in a day before trading was halted.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Global leader in 5G networks**\n\nTo keep it short Nokia is currently a network company. Main competitors being Huawei, Ericsson and Samsung. You can still buy Nokia branded mobile phones and other products under their licensing agreements, but the core is in the networks (fixed and wireless). Heart of the R&D is an iconic Bell Labs. Key words to current Nokia are 5G, edge cloud, AI, IoT etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Share count vs Market cap**\n\nNokia share count is 5.6 billion and market cap $31 billion (9\/17\/2021). During the meme action people figured out that the market cap 26.4 billion in January is what really counts, and this proofed to be right. It really doesn't matter if there are 5.6 billion shares at the price of $4.73 or 1.12 B shares with the price of $23.65 - exactly the same market cap.\n\nAs a comparison this year $GME and $AMC market caps peaked $37.3 B and $36.9 B respectively. However, $NOK didn't have a huge short position for leverage but instead it was and still is a value play with EUR 3.7 billion net cash and solid profitable cashflow. It is an undervalued quality stock in the blink of a turnaround. To give some perspective Nokia market cap was in January 2021 one tenth of Cisco's.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Renewed product portfolio is second to none in the industry**\n\nLet's face it, Nokia had problems with 5G product portfolio development after it acquired Alcatel Lucent in 2016. Company simply didn't have enough resources to focus on 5G product line while they were busy to merge ALU and Nokia 4G product portfolios. So, they ended up taking a shortcut by using programmable FPGA chips in their products instead of more efficient and cost friendly SoC chips.\n\nEventually Nokia focused to SoCs in 2019 and it took two years to catch the competition with new Reefshark based products using SoCs. In July 2021 the huge workload was pretty much done and at the end of this year over 70% of shipped products will be based on SoC's and the new deals will be more or less all part of the renewed product portfolio.\n\nNow that Nokia has catched up the gap to the competitors in product competitiveness it is adding even more firepower to the R&D efforts which can be seen as a good sign. Main target is to be the best network company in the industry and according to the management we will see some new exciting product launches still in this year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Main competitor still banned by US government**\n\nUS has been accusing Huawei about close connections to Chinese communist party and sees it as a possible security threat. Therefore, it has been warning other countries to avoid using its products and about a year ago even banned Huawei to buy much needed 5G chips. Naturally the company bought as many chips to stock as it could but it\u2019s now running out of parts (much worse situation compared to January 2021).\n\nTheir mobile handset business is currently sinking (no new 5G phones at all), and it seems that for base stations it must start using less sophisticated and more energy consuming components manufactured by Chinese suppliers. So, they will be able to deliver products but at what cost?\n\nThere have been articles stating that Chinese government should compensate energy costs to operators in order to make the new products more appealing. Pretty much the same strategical approach which Huawei has been successfully using in the past decade stealing market share from Nokia and Ericsson by selling products even under the price of components. All this has been possible because Chinese government has been subsidizing the company generously. Sad side effect has been that even there are a handful network providers left in the industry it has been hard to make any profit. Now it seems that US ban is changing the game and market share is flooding to western rivals which can start raising their prices and margins to reasonable levels.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOverall the global situation is much different than it was a couple of years ago. It\u2019s too risky for operators to focus purely on buying less secure underpriced Chinese products as their own government or consumers might turn against them. For operators it\u2019s more important to do business with reliable and ethical partners. Nokia is a good choice as it has been named by Ethisphere as one of the 2021 world's most ethical companies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Competent management with can do attitude**\n\nPekka Lundmark is the current CEO following Stephen Elop and Rajeev Suri. He did a much-needed strategy review in the company about a year ago and since then the progress has been convincing. Nokia buried its end to end strategy, business unit heads are now fully responsible of profit & loss and the decision making is not anymore scattered around the organization. All businesses are seeing growth and the change is already visible in the financial numbers even the three-year strategy execution is only in its first phase.\n\nPekka has also totally changed the company's comms policy. Nowadays Nokia is very transparent with its comms. It prefer to set lower targets and give surprise profit raises instead of promising the moon from the sky in the first place. The new policy might seem pessimistic to some but to be honest the overpromising strategy didn\u2019t work well either and shareholders along with analysts lost the faith to the company. We might argue that the current undervaluation is indirect consequence of bad comms and it simply takes a few solid quarters to convince otherwise.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**COVID and future technologies supporting 5G \u00edmplementation**\n\nCOVID boosted the network usage globally and we are seeing growing demand for better networks with higher capacity and lower latencies. However, behind the scenes there is much more happening. Companies and research labs are inventing killer apps and products to best use 5G networks. For example, VR and AR could potentially be something to wait for.\n\nBig problems with VR\/AR have been the storage, power consumption, and processing power. 5G will solve the problems by pushing these  away from the PC and into the edge cloud. Imagine the next Facebook where people will get a totally new sense of immersion with VR\/AR. When this happen the consumers and companies will be begging for growing 5G availability with more bandwidth and lower latency capabilities.\n\nPrivate wireless use cases and smart city solutions are key parts to lead the next technological revolution with significant productivity gains and will grow the demand for high quality networks. Lufthansa, many ports and mining companies are already taking advantage of early wins to beat the competition.\n\nOh boy, oh boy when the first significant use cases for masses pop up. The demand for high speed networks will skyrocket and I bet that the few relevant network companies will not sell their products and services cheap now that Chinese are not anymore disrupting the markets.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What analysts are saying?**\n\nAnalysts focusing on the company are much more optimistic than the market currently. End of July Goldman Sachs raised their target to 6.10 EUR.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nClosing price (September 17): **$5.50** (4.70 EUR)\n\nTarget price: High $8.27, Median **$7.12**, Low $5.75\n\nBuy: **17**, Overweight: **3**, Hold: **9**, Sell: **0**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Peculiar trading activity this week**\n\nNokia stock has been arrogantly used to rinse option players every now and then by market players. It seems that max pain levels for option players have been reached time and again. Actually, this happened past weeks as well when the share price was pushed from $6.29 (peak after Nokia raised their guidance for 2021) to $5.50 without any negative news. Someone adjusted the robots well as the closing price on Friday was precisely $5.50 (maximum gains for bankers). Only medicine to stop this kind of activity would be to grow the faithful owner base so it would be more difficult for market player to move the share price. Eventhough in the longrun these kind of short-term movements are meaningless.\n\nWith these levels, next week will be a great buying opportunity for long-term investors who see the underlying potential in this hidden gem. Not even meme phenomenon is needed to reach the double digits in $NOK share price in the coming years.\n\nDisclaimer. I\u2019m long-term Nokia owner with solid position of shares (9\/17\/2021 -> up +10%, YTD +49,13 %). I see the stock as a great value play in a long run but I\u2019m not a financial advisor so buy with your own risk.",

        "43":"Cautionary note on de-SPAC squeezes All these de-SPAC squeezes are a zero sum game and will only last until warrants get redeemed or exercised. Warrants add a lot more shares at a low price. If the share price being elevated is already bound by warrant exercise\/redemption timing, it'll be extremely sensitive to any capital raise efforts by the company. That means the companies won't be able to raise much capital to benefit permanently from the squeeze. So the price will probably go all the way back down to pre-squeeze levels.\n\nMoreover, most of these companies were overvalued to begin with. That's why they were trading under NAV. They have smaller floats than expected but that doesn't mean they're undervalued like the original squeeze plays were last year. We already know shorts can delay covering for months via FTDs. Don't diamond hand thinking you'll be able to sell at a higher floor months later like GME, AMC, etc.\n\nAnother problem is that if squeeze buyers keep pursuing new plays in a zero sum set of plays, their capital will spread thin and become less powerful. The upside illiquidity pressure needed to spark a squeeze requires focused conviction buying. Therefore, future squeezes will be less dramatic or not happen at all.\n\nThis is not meant to shit on any play you aped into, just a note of caution in an ocean of confirmation bias.

I'm a turbomachinery engineer by trade, and I damn near went to work for SpaceX pretty recently actually, so I do have a sense of the engineering prowess the company has. But, we all know what a company is actually doing doesn't necessarily mean the stock price is going to respond similarly...it's mainly psychological not real; i.e., Gamestop and AMC.

        "63":"Auph: let\u2019s talk about gamma ramp fueled rockets \ud83d\ude80 The basics:\n\nAs a pre-cursor - This post is not intended to be too much about the fundamental basics of the company. [This](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/pmaxlb\/auph_best_treatment_against_lupus_nephritis_still\/) was posted here and did a pretty good job of that. Basically, they have a new standard of care drug that is saving lives in a rare disease. \n\nAlso, I am not a financial advisor, yada yada, this is not financial advice, yada yada standard disclaimer.\n\nNow that you\u2019re current if you read the link, let\u2019s get this thing going.\n\nAurinia is in a very special spot right now. As many of you may know, we are headed into triple witching week (simply put, the expiration of stock options, stock index futures, and stock index options all fall on the same day), this only happens four times a year and makes stocks very volatile.\n\nWhy does this make Auph special? While, for this week alone [Auph already has 27k options that are ITM](https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/quote\/AUPH\/options?date=1631836800&p=AUPH), if you include the [October calls, its 68k options ITM](https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/quote\/AUPH\/options?date=1634256000&p=AUPH). \n\nWhat's really important is when you notice that they are on the precipice of $20. As they cross $20, another 25.5k options come into the money. At $25 another 33k options come into the money from both September and October. Most stocks, especially Auph, do not attract this much out of the money buying volume, especially one week until expiration. \n\nSo what happened?\n\nUsually, you can look at this and assume a whale or someone leaked something and a move higher is coming. Many figure this is the case as 2 weeks back, a bit over 40k call options were purchased in 2 days. Why? Possibly because for multiple reasons there is speculation a buyout is coming ([pr about a buyout resulting in firings](https:\/\/www.benzinga.com\/m-a\/21\/08\/22676683\/aurinia-pharma-shares-up-3-7-following-earlier-press-release-from-co-disclosing-it-entered-deal-to-b), delisting from tsx, and multiple articles whisperings for months in reputable newspapers about buyout negotiations).\n\nThat all being said, this puts the stock in a special spot. [**Referencing this post**](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/lz8mgr\/a_deepdive_on_the_actual_math_behind_gamma\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)**, on the basics of how a gamma squeeze works,** if auph crosses 20$ on Monday morning, it should begin a gamma ramp. This process creates a runaway effect when the next set of available options also has a large OI. For example, as Auph crosses $20, MMs begin to cover their calls more aggressively as they begin to come into the money, meaning they will buy more shares. As they buy more shares, the stock price will raise, as the stock price raises, they will need to buy more shares. This is compounded especially when the next option has a large OI. With the massive OI on both September and October $20 and $25 calls, a gamma squeeze would be huge and could possibly even put the $25s in the money by the end of the week.\n\nAs a precursor to all of this, I rode GME, from 10 to 400 ( go back and check [my comment history](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/kakxrm\/gme_tribe_a_story_about_how_ryan_cohen_is_about\/gfbe9hx?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) if you don\u2019t believe me). No one really talks about it, but it was a gamma squeeze before it was a short squeeze. Auph, while not GME sits in a similar position. Over the past month during their run. They have not seen even a 1% change in short interest (current short interest is 17% of float). So after a gamma squeeze, there very well could still exist a chance for a short squeeze.\u00a0\n\n**TLDR:** Due to a massive option OI, Aurinia is ripe for a gamma squeeze **sending it much higher**. If it crosses 20, it could easily see 25. If it crosses 25, it will likely keep a runaway effect.\n\n**As a last note:** \n\nAll of this becomes moot if Aurinia is bought out before Monday morning or before calls expire at the end of the week. At this point, I would highly suggest looking to the XBI, and strong biotech tickers like MYOV (Shameless plug, but is currently undergoing a share buying program from the main owner that took it from about 20 to 27 and is only halfway complete, has a deal with PFE for $4.2b, and 3 standard of care approved indications), as well as some other strong biotech stocks that stand potential to surge in the case of AUPH money flowing to other tickers after a buyout (This happened after $TRIL buyout as well).  \n\nMy positions: \n\nAuph: 0 shares, 260 calls. September $20, $25, and $30. October $20 and $25.\n\nMyov: 22,500 shares. 210 calls, spread dates and strikes. Mostly ITM.",
        "69":"Stop buying dumpster fires and buy ASO I\u2019ve refrained from writing a post here on my position in ASO for a while because I don\u2019t want to peddle my shit  and turn this thing into a meme stock (or do i) but I feel like I\u2019d be doing a disservice to my fellow retards by not sharing a major value story here with y\u2019all. GME made me more money than I've ever had, so I hope this can do something like that for some of yall, truly. \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nQuick Pitch\n\nASO is at a P\/E ratio of 6.6 -7, with revenue $6+ billion, increasing margins and more profitable than ever, amarket cap of only $3.5b and their debt load being dramatically reduced ahead of schedule. Heavily owned by institutions, KKR dramatically reducing their majority shareholder % to now only 20%. A share repurchase program for $500mil and a lot of insider buying and Ken Hicks who turned Footlocker around took their share price straight up\u2026. How and why are people you guys not buying this up? This 6% dip this morning is probably the best value you can get on the market. Its pretty much an anomaly in today\u2019s market climate. \n\nDKS (Dicks sporting goods) PE ratio is at a 11\/12. If ASO was adjusted to just a PE of 9 they would be somewhere around $58.00 a share which is a 45% increase from where we are at today. 9 is extremely fair. As the best and most efficient retailor in the market they should be a 15 or $85 a share. \n\nASO, Academy Sports and Outdoors, is massively undervalued compared to its peers and it is the best player in the space. Why aren\u2019t retail investors piling into this for locked  gains has me confused? It\u2019s a real company with real customers that are loyal and lifers of Academy, many have been shopping there since they were kids and now it\u2019s where they shop for their kids.  My guess is investors see Covid days as good as it\u2019s going to get for Academy, but the reopening is proving to be even bigger and permanent than expected.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nIt\u2019s important to know where Academy stores are located and who they serve. Academy has 259 mostly in the Southeast. They are a low\/mid cost sports and outdoors retailer. Think youth sports, gym clothes, and camping\/fishing \/hunting gear. Their stores are often the only specialty retailer in a suburban area and some more heavily populated areas where ASO and Dicks compete (and in those area ASO wins every time). Their customers tend to be more blue-collar simpler consumers who would rather touch and feel the products vs order online for convenience, even though online sales have picked up drastically recently. Not having a strong online presence is not something that should turn you away from this stock. Nobody buys fishing equipment, camping gear, your child\u2019s sports equipment online, these are things you want to touch and feel and try on and especially with this crowd of consumers.\n\nLike I said I think investors look at covid lockdowns as if it were ASO\u2019s best days, in fact I think this is why KKR ultimately decided to take them public after seeing 2 monster quarters back-to-back, they knew their valuation would be higher than it\u2019s ever been and thought better take advantage of this fluke. I believe retailers are valued at IPO on their previous 2 quarters. But they didn\u2019t expect to keep having monster record earnings afterwards so turns out they jumped the gun. Here\u2019s why it will continue at least for a couple more quarters. Q2 last year we were completely shut down, sure exercise equipment and bike sales were through the roof, but youth sports and other sections came to a screeching halt. Now you have a massive reopening trade that will last a couple quarters longer as kids get back to each of their respective sports (each season) after a year hiatus and adults get back to their hobbies. Kids grow fast and I\u2019m predicting this sector of the business will be on fire for a bit as parents have to replace outgrown equipment. This should bring more traffic to their stores than ever Academy is doing well and will continue to do well because they have a massive loyal following in the South with a product mix that\u2019s borderline recession proof and mostly resilient to online retailers. \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nComps\n\n21\u2019 Guidance compared to 19\u2019 Pre-Covid\n\n\\-  Q2 Net Income at $560,000,000 up from $120,000,000 in 2019\u2013 increase of 352%\n\n\\-  Net Sales at $6.5B up from $4.8B in 2019 \u2013 increase of 35% \n\n\\-  EPS - $5.45-$5.80 up from $1.60 \u2013 increase of 252%\n\n21\u2019 guidance compared to 20\u2019 numbers (keep in mind 20\u2019 was thought to be their record fluke sales year)\n\n\\-  Q2 Net Income at $560,000,000 up from $309,000,000 in 2020 \u2013 increase of 76%\n\n\\-  Net Sales at $6.5B up from 5.689B in 2020 \u2013 increase of 15%\n\n\\-  EPS - $5.45-$5.80 up from $3.79 in 2020 \u2013 increase of 48%\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nOther bullish indicators\n\n\\-  Gross margin increased 29.4% to $642.5 million, the highest quarterly gross profit in the Company's history. The gross margin rate improved by 500 basis points to 35.9%. This growth was primarily driven by stronger merchandise margins from a favorable product mix shift, higher average unit retails and less promotional activity.\n\n\\-  The company also took steps to enhance its balance sheet. As of the end of the second quarter, the Company\u2019s cash and cash equivalents totaled $553.8 million with no outstanding balance on its credit facility. Adjusted free cash flow was $169.5 million. Merchandise inventories were $1.1 billion, an increase of 24.0% compared to the prior year quarter and 3.2% compared to Q1 2021.\n\n\\-  Academy's largest shareholder (KKR) completed two transactions, reducing their ownership to approximately 20% of the Company as of the end of the quarter.\n\n\\-  As part of one of these events, Academy purchased and retired 3.2 million shares for approximately $100 million.\n\n\\-  In addition to the stock repurchase, the Company paid down $99 million of its outstanding term loan and refinanced the loan's interest rate from LIBOR + 5.0% to LIBOR + 3.75%. Based on these positive actions, S&P (B+ from B) and Moody's (Ba3 from B1) both upgraded the Company's debt rating.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nIm long 6,350 shares at $37.30 basis. \n\nI'll let others talk about the Short Interest attached to ASO and any potential squeezes. I think its a buy  with easy 50-100% upside regardless of any of that. That would all be bonus. But if this thing does move to $50-$55 quickly it could really trap some of the shorts and gap up pretty quickly. \n\nPlease take advantage of this and stop buying Discord pump and dumps.",
        "80":"Reverse Repos, their effect on the Market, and Theories on why it's been over 1 Trillion for 24 days **TL;DR Too much cash, not enough collateral.**\n\n**Disclaimer:** I am by no means an expert on this topic, I like to snort green crayons but recently have been getting into some reds, and therefore barely know wtf I'm talking about. I'm not arrogant enough to claim I know everything to do with this and won't pretend to. Do your own DD, come up with your own conclusions, and remember the economy always goes up until it doesn't.\n\nOutside of a few select stock subreddits that I shall not name here, not many people seem to be talking about Reverse Repos and their subsequent effect on the market. Let's fix that, shall we?\n\n**What are Overnight Reverse Repos (ONRRP)?**\n\nI'm not gonna bore the shit out of y'all with a bunch of technical jargon so I shall simplify it (and note: this is a *simplification* and therefore some nuance and detail is not included, so go fuck yourself if you feel the need to be an ass about something I didn't include.)\n\nReverse Repo's are basically an agreement between the Federal Reserve (which is *not* the same thing as the Federal government) and large financial institutions (banks, hedge funds, Market Makers, your wife's boyfriend, etc.) that basically boils down to the Fed giving these institutions a \"specified security\" (usually U.S. Treasury Bonds) in exchange for cash. Now, since the government is stingy with their T-Bonds and Financial institutions might need their money back at a moment's notice, these transactions are essentially reversed at the end of the day.\n\nThe Reverse Repo Program (Or RRP for short) is \"officially\" used to tighten the money supply. (Note how I said officially, I'll come back to that later.)\n\nNow, there is another program that is sometimes mentioned, called the Repo Program, which is basically the opposite of the Reverse Repo. It is used to \"inflate\" the money supply in the economy. I will not go into much more detail on this program since I have used my remaining few brain cells to understand Reverse Repos and not much else.\n\n**Cool, but, like, why?**\n\nSo to understand why this program is essential to \"control the money supply\" (aka Decrease Inflation), you have to understand one thing about these big financial institutions.\n\n**Cash = Bad**\n\nSeems counterintuitive, right?  Well, sort of. Basically, cash in itself is bad for these businesses because of one simple reason; Inflation. Cash is considered a liability (a risk) on their balance sheets when it's just sitting there not doing anything. Does the phrase \"Use money to make money\" ring a bell? Regardless, Institutions need to have most of their money in investments in order to not lose money and any opportunities to make money.\n\nNow that we've gotten that out of the way, let's talk about what exactly these bad boys have been doing for the last year and a half.\n\n**What the Fed doin'?**\n\nHere I'm going to lay out the facts of the matter and leave the speculation as to the why's further down in the next section. So, I hope y'all like pictures.\n\nStarting in March of this year, The RRP had begun to be used after nearly a year of nothing. This began after margin requirements for banks were reinstated in March after the Fed had significantly lowered them to help the economy after the COVID crash.\n\n[RRP Market Aug '20 - Sep '21](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/0ps7veqajyl71.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f951259466fbd0f5eeb5b9ffe7d4a7cc4352169)\n\nIt has only increased since.\n\nNot only that, the *way* it has increased is rather unusual compared to the past. Up until around late 2018, the RRP market was used rather frequently but usually only during Quater ends. \n\n[RRP Market '13 - '21](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/w3c1nsqdjyl71.png?width=1171&format=png&auto=webp&s=097526b85b2ff45ffb9d813ec22b26e98bc20861)\n\nSo this sharp increase with seemingly no correlation with Quarter ends has led to a lot of people smelling the bullshit so to speak.\n\n**1 Trilly Baby**\n\nSince August 11th, the RRP has been above 1 Trillion and has, as of August 31st, hit a high of 1.189 Trillion. The previous high before this year was around $474 billion in 2015, right at the end of Quater 4.\n\n**Why is this happening?**\n\nThe simple answer is that we don't know. Don't pull out the pitchforks quite yet, there are a few theories as to why just no concrete reason (as of yet) since none of the big boys want to reveal their hands.\n\n**Stock Market Crash**\n\nThe Stock Market has been reaching ATH's for the last few weeks and with the eviction moratorium ending, and possibly up to 11 million families at risk of losing their homes, there's a chance a crash is coming which may make 2008 look like peanuts in comparison. (MBS's anyone?)  *\"The last time this many families were behind on their mortgages was during the Great Recession.\" - CFPB*\n\nIn regards to this coming crash, it's possible that big investors are unwilling to risk putting more money into the market when they can rely on the government with their T-bonds. (Which also helps their margin requirements, so win-win for them.) I admit, this is pretty speculative and needs further research than what I'm willing to do right now.\n\n**Collateral Crisis**\n\nThere is some evidence that there is an actual shortage of Treasury bills within the market (dropping yields from their highs earlier this year) which could explain the Big Boys reliance on the FED and RRP. Oh, and the money printer himself, JPOW, said this, *\u201cYou could say there is a shortage of safe short assets\u2026 there\u2019s a shortage of T-bills\u201d*. So, yeah that's mildly concerning.\n\n**Short Positions**\n\nAnother reason as to the apparent need for bonds could be risky bets made by financial institutions (\"meme\" stocks anyone?) and the inevitability of short positions bankrupting them. I seriously doubt any of the big boys have closed most of their short positions yet so this is my personal theory.\n\nThere is also a chance that it's a combination of all three, none, or something else entirely that has yet to rear its ugly head.\n\n**TL;DR PT 2**\n\nThe point is; Reverse Repo's are a signal that the market is in risky shape due to unavoidable monetary policy decisions by the Fed (brought on by COVID) and Financial Institutions taking incredibly risky bets with other peoples' money. Time will tell what exactly caused this spike in Reverse Repo's but I'd hedge your bets whichever way you can.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Positions:** GME\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**References:**  Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Overnight Reverse Repurchase Agreements: Treasury Securities Sold by the Federal Reserve in the Temporary Open Market Operations \\[RRPONTSYD\\], retrieved from FRED, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis; [https:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/series\/RRPONTSYD](https:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/series\/RRPONTSYD), September 3, 2021.\n\nLewis Huxley.

My target would be the blue zone marked below, but I would expect at least a retest of 400 at some point.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/otk9bws3bej71.png?width=597&format=png&auto=webp&s=e308ef6d7b168dcf9c1d3bb4c94c8d4ec80c5d7d\n\nNow on to our memes. BB (Blackberry for all you newbs), has been patiently consolidating, waiting for an outflow from boomer equities back into the memes. If you have been paying attention the past few months, you notice that any time the market starts to fall, the memes start to pop a little. It's almost like people are treating the meme stocks as safety for their cash because they have been pretty consistent with basically having a negative Beta.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/jsnvy5bocej71.png?width=482&format=png&auto=webp&s=d29185f1559ae2ef9819853b4f9bcb5a5890ccde\n\nIf you look at the chart below, this is the weekly chart showing the first and second meme pumps casually lifting off the long term trendline marked. The selling has dried up, and volume managed to enter at the right time to maintain our trend. Now if this holds and BB manages to break above our recent high ($28.77), $40 per share could be possible given that the current market situation develops as I imagine it will, with SPY falling at the same time the memes are catching significant inflow.\n\nCurrent position in BB:\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/2rcqrj6scej71.png?width=918&format=png&auto=webp&s=459d81e090de32f6a06af99303d7ca11fcf12764\n\nCurrent position in SPY (lottos):\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/35c84pkvcej71.png?width=859&format=png&auto=webp&s=f703a336d834c7143a689d881bf7d0db063d1d9a\n\nBB, AMC, GME, lets fuck the hedgies once again.\n\nEDIT: Edited for clarification on recent high.\n\nYou can also follow more of my bullshit at TheStonksDaddy on twitter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

        "104":"Follow The Money II - Understanding Sectors And Adapting To Every Market Condition # I. Introduction\n\nI think the **hardest part about trading is that the market is constantly evolving**. We are creatures of habit, as a result we get complacent and think we can find a single, comfortable strategy that works an infinite amount of times. This is almost never the case; different market conditions call for different approaches. By combining this post with my last, you should **obtain a basic understanding of how you can read market conditions, and adapt with the market.**\n\nIf you [read my previous post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/p1x0ls\/follow_the_money_how_to_catch_every_rotation_and\/), you now know when money is flowing into equities, and when it is flowing into bonds, the dollar and other safe havens. You also know about the different indexes, and what basket of stocks they carry. You even know about some interesting correlations that have arisen recently related to tech and a risk off rotation.\n\nIn this one - I'm going to take it a step further, and dig a little deeper, showing you all how to tell exactly which types equities money is flowing to, and **how to use that to generate high probability trades.** In this era of passive indexation, **you are almost never just buying one stock**. You are buying one stock - and every stock correlated to it. That means, **when you are buying CLOV and PLTR - you are also buying WISH, BB, AMC, UWMC and GME.** This obviously is not a category of stocks by traditional means - but in recent times it has become one. The point is - **you are going all in on one stock and you don't even realize it.**\n\nTo avoid this phenomenon - you need to understand the different different industries present within the market. Equities all belong to at least one of these - **and will usually track the rest of the stocks within their respective industry quite closely.**\n\n# II. The Eleven Sectors That Define The Market\n\nThere is generally believed to be eleven different sectors that equities belong to. In this section, I'll detail what each one is, **the ETF you can use to track it**, and what environment it usually outperforms in.\n\nAlso, there's two main categories for stocks: **cyclicals - which follow the business cycle, and non-cyclicals - which perform the same year round.**\n\n# 1 - Energy (VDE)\n\n**What It Is -**\n\n\"The energy sector is a category of stocks that relate to producing or supplying energy. The energy sector or industry includes companies involved in the exploration and development of oil or gas reserves, oil and gas drilling, and refining. The energy industry also includes integrated power utility companies such as renewable energy and coal.\"\n\n\\- *Investopedia*\n\nBasically, this sector is dominated by the oil industry. You will notice renewables will hardly effect it's price movements a vast majority of the time. While many are trying to shift away from oil, it will likely be a massive part of our economy and our market long into the future.\n\n**When It Outperforms -**\n\nIn most situations - the energy sector is cyclical. This means when our economy is doing well and expanding - it will perform well.  When it isn't, the reverse is true. Because it is dominated by a commodity, energy companies also have no issue passing on inflation to their consumers. However, keep in mind this one is a bit special because of OPEC and their ability to influence price.\n\n\"OPEC is a cartel that **aims to manage the supply of oil** in an effort to set the price of oil on the world market, in order to avoid fluctuations that might affect the economies of both producing and purchasing countries.\"\n\n*- Investopedia*\n\nBasically, they have most of the oil, and fix the prices to their liking. This can have some unforeseen effects on the market, so if you are trading energy you definitely want to monitor their movements.\n\n# 2 - Materials (VAW)\n\n**What It Is -**\n\n\"The basic materials sector is an industry category made up of businesses engaged in the discovery, development, and processing of raw materials. The sector includes companies engaged in mining and metal refining, chemical products,\u00a0and forestry products.\"\n\n\\- *Investopedia*\n\n**When It Outperforms -**\n\nThe materials sector is cyclical. It is sensitive to changes in the economy and tracks it pretty closely. This is another sector that can easily pass inflation onto their consumers due to the nature of their products. It's also going to be especially sensitive to any changes in the supply and demand of raw materials worldwide.\n\n# 3 - Industrials (VIS)\n\n**What It Is -**\n\n\"The industrial goods sector includes stocks of companies that mainly produce capital goods used in manufacturing, resource extraction, and construction. Businesses in the industrial goods sector make and sell machinery, equipment, and supplies that are used to produce other goods rather than sold directly to consumers.\"\n\n\\- *Investopedia*\n\nBasically, the materials sector passes raw materials to the industrials sector - which converts them to products used to manufacture the final products passed on to consumers.\n\n**When It Outperforms -**\n\nBecause it is so closely tied to how much companies are producing - this sector is also cyclical. This is yet another sector that can pass the costs of inflation onto their consumers. Subsequently, due to it's close ties with the materials sector - it will be especially sensitive to the supply and demand of raw materials.\n\n# 4 - Consumer Discretionary (VCR)\n\n**What It Is -**\n\n\"Consumer discretionary is a term for classifying goods and services that are considered non-essential by consumers, but desirable if their available income is sufficient to purchase them. Examples of consumer discretionary products can include durable goods, high-end apparel, entertainment, leisure activities, and automobiles.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\\- *Investopedia*\n\nEssentially, anything broke people can't afford, like those who went all in on WISH calls before earnings, goes in this basket.\n\n**When It Outperforms -**\n\nBecause it depends on the income of consumers - this is also a cyclical sector. When the economy is thriving, people will have more money to blow on non-essential goods, like $120 Lululemon shorts, or tickets to Disney World.\n\n# 5 -  Consumer Staples (VDC)\n\n**What It Is -**\n\n\"The term consumer staples refers to a set of essential products used by consumers. This category includes things like foods and beverages, household goods, and hygiene products as well as alcohol and tobacco. These goods are those products that people are unable\u2014or unwilling\u2014to cut out of their budgets regardless of their financial situation.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\\- *Investopedia*\n\nBasically the opposite of consumer discretionary - these are things people **NEED** not things that they **WANT.**\n\n**When It Outperforms -**\n\nThese are non-cyclical, or defensive - which means regardless of how the economy is doing they will perform more or less the same. This means when the economy is taking a turn for the worst, they will generally outperform the other sectors. This doesn't mean they are immune to business cycle changes entirely, but they are certainly much less affected by them.\n\n# 6 - Health Care (VHT)\n\n**What It Is -**\n\n\"The healthcare sector consists of businesses that provide medical services, manufacture medical equipment or drugs, provide medical insurance, or otherwise facilitate the provision of healthcare to patients. The healthcare sector is one of the largest and most complex in the U.S. economy, accounting for close to a fifth of overall gross domestic product (GDP). The U.S. healthcare sector benefits from a strong system of medical research and development, in cooperation with the higher education system and the technology industry. The aging U.S. population and the advancing senescence of the Baby Boomer generation are driving ongoing strong demand in the healthcare sector.\"\n\n\\- *Investopedia*\n\n**When It Outperforms -**\n\nThis one is a bit complicated because there are a few industries within the sector, namely: medical equipment, drug R&D, and health insurance. The sector is non-cyclical - but each industry has it's own quirks.\n\nThe drug industry in particular often moves independently of everything else on the market, because it is highly dependent on new developments and news pieces related to potentially groundbreaking treatments. Health insurance and medical equipment is usually non-negotiable regardless of the business cycle - so it will outperform in times of economic distress, and generally perform the same year round.\n\n# 7 - Financials (VFH)\n\n**What It Is -**\n\n\"The financial sector is a section of the economy\u00a0made up of\u00a0firms and institutions that provide financial services to commercial and retail customers. This\u00a0sector comprises a broad range of industries including banks, investment companies, insurance companies, and real estate firms.\"\n\n\\- *Investopedia*\n\n**When It Outperforms -**\n\nBanks involve the supply and demand of money. They make money through fees and interest rate spreads. Banks perform well during economic expansion when companies and individuals are borrowing money. One of the main drivers of borrowing\/lending is interest rates. In a rising rate environment (observed through TNX, TLT, US treasury yield curve), banks will outperform. They pay short term rates (front of curve) on their deposits, and lend money to companies or individuals at a higher interest rate (further out on the curve) capturing a difference or \"spread\" on interest paid vs received. Understanding treasury yields and how they are related to the daily price movements in the financial sector is a great place to start.\n\n# 8 - Information Technology (VGT)\n\n**What It Is -**\n\n\"The technology sector is the category of stocks relating to the research, development, or distribution of technologically based goods and services. This sector contains businesses revolving around the manufacturing of electronics, creation of software, computers, or products and services relating to information technology.\"\n\n\\- *Investopedia*\n\nThis one really needs no introduction.\n\n**When It Outperforms -**\n\nThis is a bit tricky due to some correlations that have arisen from 2020 onward. For most of history - most tech stocks were cyclical. However, due to COVID, extremely low interest rates, and some other factors - these assets are now being rotated into during a risk off environment - and are seen as a safe-haven. Who knows if this will stand, but it's important to understanding when money will flow there **today.** More on this can be found in my previous post, where I go into detail on this phenomenon.\n\n# 9 - Communication Services (VOX)\n\n**What It Is -**\n\n\"The telecommunication sector is made up of companies that make communication possible on a global scale, whether it is through the phone or the Internet, through airwaves or cables, through wires or wirelessly. These companies created the infrastructure that allows data in words, voice, audio, or video to be sent anywhere in the world. The largest companies in the sector are telephone (both wired and wireless) operators, satellite companies, cable companies, and Internet service providers.\"\n\n\\- *Investopedia*\n\n**When It Outperforms -**\n\nThis is another non-cyclical sector. Whether the economy is good or bad - people aren't going to give up communicating with each other. In today's world, everyone needs a phone - even if it's a flip phone - and everyone needs internet access. One of the interesting parts of this sectors is that it is comprised of both growth names and income names. While the larger names are more consistent with dividends, the smaller names often have more room for capital appreciation and earnings growth.\n\n# 10 - Utilities (VPU)\n\n**What It Is -**\n\n\"The utilities sector refers to a category of companies that provide basic amenities, such as water, sewage services, electricity, dams, and natural gas. It is a large sector, and an important part of the U.S. economy, with a market capitalization of over $1.5 trillion (as of March 2021). Although utilities are private, for-profit companies, they are part of the public service landscape\u2014providing as they do such staples for daily living\u2014and are therefore heavily regulated. Investors typically treat utilities as long-term holdings and use them to generate a steady income for their portfolios.\"\n\n\\- *Investopedia*\n\n**When It Outperforms -**\n\nYet another non-cyclical basket of stocks. Regardless of the business cycle, demand for utilities almost always remains constant. These are some of the most stable stocks on the market - so WSB is probably better going to forget they exist moments after reading this post.\n\n# 11 - Real Estate (VNQ)\n\n**What It Is -**\n\n\"Real estate is the land along with any permanent improvements attached to the land, whether natural or man-made\u2014including water, trees, minerals, buildings, homes, fences, and bridges. Real estate is a form of real property. It differs from personal property, which are things not permanently attached to the land, such as vehicles, boats, jewelry, furniture, and farm equipment.\"\n\n*- Investopedia*\n\n**When It Outperforms -**\n\nLike most industries, real estate involves the supply and demand of property, both residential and commercial. Real Estate is closely related to changes in construction or development, but also heavily influenced by interest rates. Most participants are using Loan to Value (LTV), anywhere from 60-85% of the total property value; therefore, interest rate changes will impact participants' ability to borrow. Thinking through these variables, its safe to assume that real estate performs well in low interest rate environments, low-moderate commodity prices for construction, population growth, and government (both local and federal) infrastructure support. When rates rise, the debt burden increases and money is hard to borrow; which ultimately affect the ability to invest in new projects or purchase homes.\n\n# III. Practical Applications\n\nTo use all of this information - and convert it to probabilities I can use to trade - **I perform technical analysis on each sector ETF using the 1 year 1 day chart (swing trade timeframe)**. If one is breaking out of a large setup - I can assume money is going to move there in the future. If others are forming nice setups - I know to add them to my watchlist.\n\nAfter identifying a sector that is likely to become strong in the near future - **I then filter it further by finding particular stocks within the sector that have similar setups**. I usually look through the top holdings of the ETF pertaining to the sector. I do this because individual stocks are more volatile than sector ETFs and more liquid - which means there is more money to be made. If a particular stock is lagging behind the sector, it can also mean there is even more to gain than in the case of another name.\n\nYou can take this one step further and combine information from my previous posts by identifying whether we are risk on, or risk off. Cyclicals are generally going to outperform while we are risk on. Non-cyclicals will generally outperform while we are risk off.\n\n**Example -**\n\nLast week - I noticed financials were breaking out of a large falling wedge on the daily chart. This has a bullish bias - and indicates price will make a strong move in the near future. I didn't have to scan the ETF for this one, since all the stocks in it are household names.\n\n[VFH \\(Financials\\) 1 Year 1 Day](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/f8lboux5r5h71.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d82ab4b17cc79ada84ec6e65473fd1eac870309)\n\nI also noticed BAC had formed a bull flag. This was all the information I needed to enter some October Calls which I closed today for a nice profit.\n\n[BAC \\(Financials\\) 1 Year 1 Day](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/fjfynyv7r5h71.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=67e0cb7ec1e5d05729cf3e41382c8591662a896e)\n\nLastly, ZB was trending downwards and yields were rising. This was an environment banks outperform in - which means it enforced my probability of success even more.\n\n[ZB \\(Bonds\\) 1 Year 1 Day](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/6wwok3sbr5h71.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=596609c73c6bbfdfc01392c6262a9bb8044cb204)\n\nYou don't have to use technical analysis. This is just my preference. Many people use complex fundamental and economic analysis to determine these rotations. The important thing is understanding the environments particular sectors will outperform in.\n\n# IV. Closing Thoughts\n\nLet me first apologize for the wall of text. I'll do my best to summarize it for those with short attention spans in my TL;DR.\n\nIf you got through all of this, and my last post - hopefully you have a better understanding of tracking where money is going, and using that to make higher quality trades. I think this is a topic most of WSB doesn't know exists (or doesn't believe in) which causes them to lose lots of money because they are all in on meme stocks, and meme stocks haven't been in the rotation for a little while. That's not to say they won't ever be again - but for the time being the broader market has made all time highs almost daily whilst these names continue to puke their guts out.\n\n# V. TL;DR\n\nThere's **11 sectors** within the stock market.\n\nThey are:\n\n1. Energy **(VDE, Cyclical)**\n2. Materials **(VAW, Cyclical)**\n3. Industrials **(VIS, Cyclical)**\n4. Consumer Discretionary **(VCR, Cyclical)**\n5. Consumer Staples **(VDC, Non-Cyclical)**\n6. Healthcare **(VHT, Non-Cyclical)**\n7. Financials **(VFH, Cyclical)**\n8. Information Technology **(VGT, Cyclical Most Of The Time)**\n9. Communication Services **(VOX, Non-Cyclical)**\n10. Utilities **(VPU, Non-Cyclical)**\n11. Real Estate **(VNQ, Cyclical)**\n\nEach one will be rotated into depending on different market conditions. Understanding this is important to being able to make money at any given time. I perform technical analysis to determine when each is being rotated into, but you can use any analysis you want.",

        "111":"How to use the $1T US Senate Infrastructure Bill to Place Bets this Fall and Get Rich w\/ America Sup Retards\n\nI am here representing the high-functioning half of RetardedHedgeFund LLC. I founded RetardedHedgeFund with my brother way back in 2021, when, one day, my brother came to me asking for help laundering $17 that he stole from some teenage boys. As has unfortunately happened many times before, my brother took the money after beating a group of boys senseless because they had made fun of his doll collection. Now, despite what some people around here seem to think about hedge fund managers, I am not one to typically take part in financial crimes such as money laundering, but the last time my brother had stolen money in this way, the State Police came to our door and demanded he return the cash. For whatever reason, the fact that the police asked for the money to be returned, ticked my brother off. He started kicking and screaming and punching police officers, until he wound up in the psychward and I was left with a rather large hospital bill. So there I was, stuck between my brother's insurmountable anger management issues, the State Police,  and the fact that teenage boys will never stop making fun of a grown man who sits on a public street in his underpants playing with dolls, especially when that man is well known for being a violent adversary to teenage boys. I digress.\n\nIn that moment, I thought the best way to avoid a similar confrontation with the police, would be to \u201claunder\u201d my brother\u2019s $17 using a broker app and one of the fine stocks found in the Wallstreetbets portfolio. After helping my brother scour the first class market data available on WSB, we decided to go all in on AMC. As one might expect, in nearly an instant our $17 grew to over $1000. I told my brother we were selling, to which he started yelling \u201cbuy and hold\u201d while punching me in protest, and then snatched the phone from my hand. For better or worse, during the scuffle, my brother fat-fingered Robin Hood and sold our call option right when AMC hit $69 and we were left with $1123 USD in our broker account. My brother wanted to put the money immediately back in AMC, but I slyly convinced him it would be better to reinvest after it was confirmed that resistance at $420.69 had been broken. That\u2019s when we decided to take our $1123 and found our family-owned hedge fund, RetardedHedgeFund LLC.\n\nWith our freshly minted LLC, my brother wanted our first buy to be the cheapest GME calls available, and as many as we could get. However, I managed to convince him that since we were now officially big time Wallstreetbets players with our own hedge fund, we should take a look at the more mature memestocks of mememania round two. Eventually, we wound up 40% down on CLNE, which is why we are here on a Saturday morning reading a yet-to-be passed 2700 page US Senate [Infrastructure Bill](https:\/\/www.epw.senate.gov\/public\/_cache\/files\/e\/a\/ea1eb2e4-56bd-45f1-a260-9d6ee951bc96\/F8A7C77D69BE09151F210EB4DFE872CD.edw21a09.pd), praying we find someway out of this god forsaken play.\n\nIn all sincerity, from what I\u2019ve read thus far, I\u2019ve found the bill quite compelling, especially in terms placing bets this autumn. I haven\u2019t read a federal bill since I briefly taught Social Studies in what the US President had recently deemed an \u201curban disaster,\u201d and a \u201ccomplete shithole.\u201d Luckily, none of my students could read, so they never found out that I can\u2019t read either. My brother on the other hand, with his severe cognitive disability and far-below average IQ, is actually well-suited for the craft of US Law, and he has helped me sift through the gargantuan pdf to pull out a section that gave us enough hope to keep holding CLNE.\n\nI know that a lot of you reading this will have an adverse reaction to the mentioning of CLNE, and probably think I should cut my loses and load up on 0dte spy options or juicy AMC calls at the 140 strike, but that\u2019s not what this is about. This post, which will be getting progressively less shitpost-y (unless you think the Infrastructure Bill is a shitpost), is about the $1T Infrastructure Bill presently being amended in the Senate and likely to, in some form, become law by September. There is a seemingly endless amount of provisions within this bill that could lend themselves to both bull and bear theses for the coming months. For instance, I considered posting about another play I am researching, Lithium Americas Corp (LAC). Everyone knows there\u2019s some stuff in this bill about lithium mining, but it also has a surprising amount of legislating about Native Americans and \u201cIndian Land\u201d management. It so happens that a section of North America\u2019s largest lithium deposit is also the site of an exceptionally haunting Native American massacre and Indian burial ground known as *Dead Moon,* which has presently entangled LAC in a lawsuit with local tribes and stopped them from breaking ground at Thacker Pass. I will probably dig through the bill for LAC related content after my brother goes to adult summer camp, but for now, much like teenage boys and the State Police, my brother has a seemingly irrational hatred for indigenous peoples, and so he insisted we research CLNE and not LAC.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to convince anyone here to invest in CLNE\u2014in fact the last thing I want is Wallstreetbets gangingbanging CLNE again. You (we) people brought the worst kind of attention to this stock, and instead of gliding gently up to $20 all summer like I originally imagined, the CEO Andrew Littlefair has been issuing shares and shaking us all down, and, even worse, after he hyped up the meme rally on CNBC last June. This sub got the PnD vibes all up on this pile of manure.\n\n**Infrastructure Bill** **& CLNE DD**\n\nFor those of you who know nothing other about CLNE other than cow fart emojis, *\u201cClean Energy Fuels provides natural gas as an alternative fuel for vehicle fleets and related fueling solutions, primarily in the United States and Canada. It supplies RNG, compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquefied natural gas (LNG) for light, medium, and heavy-duty vehicles. Additionally, the company offers operation and maintenance services for public and private vehicle fleet customer stations.*\u201d They take methane from a biomass (cow farts) and turn into a gas that powers engines comparable to diesel, and they also are getting into hydrogen for fuel cells for private vehicles, buses, trucks, airplanes, spaceships, submarines, carbon neutral dollhouse electric generators, etc. A big part of it is a carbon emissions play, and since CLNE is expanding their infrastructure as fast as anyone in the field, the Infrastructure Bill has everything to do with them.\n\nI don\u2019t know what other retard\u2019s High School environmental science class experience was like, but I had this hippie, kind-of dyke-y but in way that was subtly hot, teacher tell me that California would be on fire by 2025 and Florida would be sinking if we didn\u2019t do things like turn cow farts into fuel for Amazon trucks. That teacher was eventually fired after she was found in a locked room with my brother while he was wearing only his underpants, but the cow farts thing stuck with me.  This 10th grade level understanding of environmental science was the reason I originally bought into CLNE \u2013 that coupled with the fact that a lot of federal politicians today look and sound like my high school science teacher did back then, and more and more politicians of all stripes are coming around to the idea of at least cashing in on greenwashing. Greenwashing trending upwards with potential federal financial support is good for CLNE.\n\nOverall the bill looks incredibly bullish for CLNE. It appears bi-partisan support has grown for RNG, carbon emissions reduction, methane capture, fuel production from feedstock and biomass, and hydrogen fuel cells. There is massive amounts of money being boasted in this bill going to things like grants, loans, tax incentives, support for labor. It\u2019s unclear at this point how much this is progressive pandering and an unattainable pipe dream, and it seems unlikely it will be nowhere near as far-reaching as the New Deal era infrastructure funding, but it might be coming at just the right time for many.\n\nHere are some highlights from the [earnings call](https:\/\/www.fool.com\/earnings\/call-transcripts\/2021\/08\/06\/clean-energy-fuels-corp-clne-q2-2021-earnings-call\/) which we can compare to elements of the Infrastructure Bill.\n\n* Increasing supply while in talks with \u201cdozens of dairies\u201d sign on as partners. (Infrastructure will be needed to capture cow farts.) \n* The largest vehicle fueling infrastructure in the country, which provides the mechanism to generate the valuable environmental fuel credits.\n* Signing RNG supply contracts with third-parties to meet today\u2019s growing demand.\n* Increasing customers in New York, Arkansas, Nebraska, California, and whatever state Amazon is.\n* Facilitating training classes with the Natural Gas Vehicle Institute for dozens of maintenance technicians who will be keeping the Amazon trucks on the road.\n* Electric \tand hydrogen-fuel cell trucks, albeit great, are perhaps limited by \tinfrastructure and mineral resources. Using the \"California Air Resources Board carbon intensity scoring, \\[an \texample\\] company would have to purchase over 6,400 electric heavy duty trucks, or 13,000 fuel cell trucks to achieve the same carbon reduction as only 1,200 trucks running a negative carbon RNG.\"\n* Recently submitted bids to build hydrogen stations for transit agencies that will be testing a handful of hydrogen buses.\n\nContent pulled from the bill to get an idea on language and numbers of provisions that might help CLNE:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* $20,000,00 wastewater grant for each of fiscal years 2022 through 2026, which includes funds for sludge (cow shit) collection, installation of anaerobic digester, methane capture, \tmethane transfer, facility upgrades and retrofits, and other new and emerging, but proven, technologies that transform waste to energy.\n* Some related grants have requirements such as must be \u201cregionally dispersed across the United States and can leverage natural gas to the maximum extent practicable\u201d which fits CLNE current business perfectly.\n* \u201cAppalachian regional energy hub initiative\u201d  The Appalachian Regional Commission may provide technical assistance to, make grants to, enter into contracts with, or otherwise provide amounts to individuals or entities in the Appalachian region for projects and activities, that will help establish a regional energy hub in the Appalachian region for natural gas and  natural gas liquids, including hydrogen produced from the steam methane reforming of natural gas feedstocks. (Grants to develop methane capture infrastructure, bullish sign for potential third-party contractors in new localities.)\n* $52,488,065,375 \tthrough 2026 per each to build infrastructure to reduce highway emissions.\n* Massive \tamounts of funding going to hydrogen found in Tittle III FUELS AND TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS. The entire Title III may be worth a look through if you want a bullish feeling for CLNE, but especially \u201cSubtittle 3--Hydrogen Research and Development,\u201d as \tRNG can be used to produce zero emissions hydrogen, and it \tspecifically mentions getting hydrogen from biomass and bio fuels, so it\u2019s easy to see CLNE taking advantage.\n\nWhether it\u2019s intentional or not, a lot of Littlefair\u2019s language on the call seems to come from having spent some time reading the bill. Big investors interested in CLNE are also likely watching the bill to estimate where state money is going.  Perhaps Littlefair is aping the bill's language in order to appeal to big investors, and if this is true, it would seem Littlefair was successful because there was a plethora of institutional buys on the day after the call.\n\n**The Present State of CLNE Stock and Retail Perception**\n\nI bought into CLNE in June when it was under $10. I had spent weeks staring nervously at exceptionally retarded calls on another stock and wanted to just park some money somewhere and let it drift upwards while I dozed through the summer, and CLNE seemed like a good buy at $10. Analysts had (have) it anywhere from $10-27, and it seemed like the recent changes in DC would lend to even more upside. Then Wallstreetbets started shouting about CLINE SI% (which barely made any fucking sense, by the way) the stock shot up to $15 on retail power and perhaps the relatively few shorts there exiting, all the retards, including my brother,  lost money on calls, and the mood about CLINE around here got very negative.\n\nInstead of drifting up to twenty, CLNE spent the summer drifting down to $6. I did not enjoy it, but I held the bag, believing it would have to go up eventually. When the earnings report came-out last Thursday night, and at the same time the stock slumped to its 2021 low, I was in despair. Where were the greenwashing greenbacks? What we\u2019re the politicians in DC doing besides trying to figure out if their pants are on or not, shouting about a vaccine that half of the population refuses to take, and looking for their son\u2019s laptop?\n\nAs culturally enriching as the president\u2019s son\u2019s DIY tweaker porn is, I thought perhaps there might be even more going on behind the scenes in DC when I decided to peak into the Infrastructure Bill. In all earnestness, I was very doom n gloom at 5AM the morning after CLNE earnings. I was smacked from sleep at 3:30AM with anxiety about a sell-off, and lying in a semi-hypnagogic state, I shit you not, I see floating above my bed, a funny looking man with big ears in a cow field, smile and say, You should just sell, son. The earnings report stated a decrease of 99.2% (yes, 99.2% decrease, just like your memestock calls). Supposedly this decrease was due to a tricky deal with Amazon, but I didn\u2019t want to think about Rocketman blasting off with hydrogen, any more than I did Littlefair issuing shares. I wanted money. Furthermore, the news is blaring about Delta variant, people invested in 3rd world vaccines are shouting about the ineffectiveness of mRNA in the rage filled chatrooms of my broker app, and I start thinking I should cut my losses with CLNE and invest in a Playstation so I can try to teach my brother how to play *Last of Us* in order to prepare him for inevitable modern tribal warfare coupled with a zombie apocalypse.\n\nThe earnings were, in actuality, not nearly as bad this Amazon deal made them look. Although revenue decreased because of the deal, CLNE increased RNG sales by 13%. As Litlefair said in the call, \u201cexcluding the effects of the Amazon warrant charges and the commodity swap and customer fueling contracts unrealized losses, revenue for the second quarter of 2021 increased by 28.9% to compared to  for the second quarter of 2020.\u201d\n\nThis is going to sound cheesy, but the Infrastructure Bill was a little ray of sunshine during what, in my more narcotic induced brain damaged moments, seems clearly to be the end of the world. My hedge fund does not participate in electoral politics publicly or privately; my brother is not allowed to vote (not because he\u2019s retarded, but because he\u2019s a convicted felon), and I find elections to have an adverse reaction with my relatively fragile mental health. I don\u2019t think a political party is going to save Earth from the human race. I think it is just as likely California will cease to be a state the moment Andrew Littlefair\u2019s cow fart machines explode and fire consumes the entire West Coast. But there is actually something in the bill that I have not felt from the federal govt probably ever in my life, but especially since the pandemic started, and that was some sort of expectation that there will be a future. Despite my better judgment, this sensation felt good to me. Furthermore, this sensation, to me, seems to be an excellent marketing tool for this particular moment and it will make the bill and it\u2019s consequences at least temporally popular. People have indulged in their unchecked desires for societal collapse and death for the last 18 months, and I think perhaps we are sick of it. What people want to know now is that they can work (and yes, actually have jobs) to improve the world for a future with or without COVID.  The Infrastructure Bill is going to create jobs that some people (at least momentarily) will feel good about doing, it\u2019s going to increase revenue in multiple sectors (and decrease it in some), it\u2019s bi-partisan, 70% popular with voters, and in the end, it could probably pay for itself by not making the money printer go brrrr so much once everyone has a decent job again. To me, of course, all this gooey-oooey goody two shoes democracy hoopla is a load of BS, because ultimately what the bill will do is at last make CLNE drift gently up to $20. I believe it already may have begun to do that before the bill is even passed, in fact.\n\nAt 7.48 CLNE is a good to buy if you don't mind holding for months, possibly year for big gains. After skimming through the bill the last couple days, I don\u2019t really see a limit to the upside. The Federal Govt. is going all in on financially supporting a phase-out of fossil fuels. Oil is likely to get tanked by another winter of COVID, while the govt is going to be offering grants, subsidies, loans, to companies like CLNE. With vaccines and better knowledge of the virus, CLNE is likely to able to continue increasing productivity. Retail isn\u2019t really buying these days, but institutions greatly increased their holdings this past week, with the majority of big buys coming in the day after earnings were released.\n\nI\u2019m now taking all of our incoming funds and investing them into CLNE shares, every time my brother beats someone up and steals their money. Risky options don't seem worth it here right now, because the stock price seems relatively in the control of big money, and big money will be the one selling you the options. The stock is largely owned by institutions, likely because it\u2019s easy to imagine how revenues will be on a steady uptrend for many years to come, especially with this Infrastructure Bill presently making it's way through congress. That said I could see $8 by Aug 20, if I were to place a relatively placid bet.\n\nTL;DR: you all are retarded but maybe not as retarded as me bc I\u2019m bagholding CLNE. I combed through the infrastructure bill, looking for bullish indicators. I found a lot of implications for CLNE but lots of provisions that could affect many stocks in very specific ways.\n\nThe Infrastructure Bill is worth paying attention for gambling purposes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: fixed the linked to earnings and fixed some writing mistakes.

But wishful thinking only gets anyone so far. That much I realised pretty quickly. I thought that very realisation made me better than the most. But alas! There still seems to be a long way to go. The majority in the active markets seems to be losing. A very, very small proportion of the active markets seems to be doing the winning. Within this sub-group, an astronomically microscopic proportion seems to be winning purely by non-randomness. Some random GME-powered-nouveau-riche-dude begs to disagree. \u201cI was smart enough to do my DD; you weren\u2019t!\u201d, he argues. \u201cBut what about the long list of many other smart people who did their DD in many, many other potential situations that didn\u2019t go as per plan? They were right with their analysis, but their gamble just did not pay off. What about them?\u201d I ask, with utmost diligence hoping to get an honest answer to my gnawing question. GME-Dude says, \u201cYou are completely whack. Do you even know how an option chain works? Do you know how a gamma squeeze works?\u201d, he asks me back with scorn. I give up. Life is too short for unproductive arguments.\n\nShould I have listened to my late grampy Mr. John Bagel, and just indexed to eff out of my life savings? As a wise sage once put it, \u201cThe Bagel is a lie!\u201d Heck! Who am I kidding? It wasn\u2019t a wise sage. It was some poor soul from Portal. And it was cake, not Bagel. Anyhow, \u201cWhy do I have to wait 50 years before I can afford Bagels?\u201d, I ask myself righteously. The question motivates me to justify my continued jedi-journey in the active markets. I study hard. I think hard. I work like a lazy-tard. I go into deep and dark places in search of arcane and precious knowledge. Now and then I come over to the surface and try to scavenge on reddit. All of a sudden, from the left flank comes the dreaded \u201cWheeler-Army\u201d. Some of them are sneaky buggers. They sound very clever, until you realise that they\u2019re selling wheels that are shaped like Bagels (not this shit again!). \u201cGotta GTF outta here!\u201d, I tell myself, as I move swiftly. I\u2019m then flanked from the right side by random Stat-dudes. \u201cHey looky here!

By asking this specific question, it lead me in a **performance based mindset.** I wanted realized profits on a weekly and month basis. NOT unrealized( when you don't sell). This gave me the space to think about the chances of  making back those profits, if I lost the money in one or few bad trades. So I narrowed it down to these percentages.\n4. Calls or Call Debits Spreads - 10% or less of Portfolio value (graph below)\n   1. It seems risking to losing 10% of PV to make 20-50% gain on trade is a good mix\n   2. Some plays overtime might zoom pass your price targets and you might just let some run, just remember to take profits because you need your portfolio to grow and not get stuck with a lucky win.\n   3. As the Portfolio grow in value due to great trades, inject new capital, long position growing, you will start to use less capital for calls\/puts\/debit spreads.\n   4. New trader make a mistake and risk it all and then have to wait **MONTHS to restart or they just give up and blame stock market sucks.** You might also here, **it works until it doesn't** lol.  Thus being stuck in the hamster wheel of the rat race. **Re-read this point again.** 5x Don't write yourself off too soon, especially if you haven't put in at least 1 year of trading.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Debit Spreads for more consistent gains?\n   1. Almost becomes a cheat code, because typically there is still equity in the trade as time passes, and your losses is limited. If your underlying goes against you, and there is more than 5 days to expiration you mostly can close out early or place a stop loss order to prevent further loss. With Calls and puts time decay and IV crush is a bitch..point blank period.\n   2. It's best to stick with SPY, IWM, and\/or QQQ but if you want to gamble with individual stocks, just know it very difficult to save the trade or escape quickly, since most of you are probably doing weeklies.\n   3. With debit spreads always close out your trade yourself to **avoid assignment**\n\nBelow is the difference between Call and Call Debit Spread.\n\n1. Both serves as a purpose of a bullish move but if the stock price is at or above the short strike price the debit spreads is also a neutral strategy\n2. The Call option, is roughly double the cost but infinite profits(this is on SPY so a rapid price movement in a day would typical not exceed more than 1-1.5% in a day.\n3. Notice how the call loses premium each day if price action stay stagnant and the debit spreads preserves capital in this scenario and as each day gets closer to expiration, the potential of profit is higher than the call but profits is limited.\n4. Below is both ATM options for call (1) and Bull Call Debit Spread (2)  on the Same expiry date.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Call \\(1\\)](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/676rri2l4yd71.png?width=1242&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d8939a284a0a8b31baa17e1631ee2c1547886ca)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Bull Call Debit Spread \\(2\\)](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ont5tqim4yd71.png?width=1250&format=png&auto=webp&s=54022e39074087836e7074e737c07bec3b60c833)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not against Calls. I used them only strategically or for gambling trades on GME, AMC, SNDL, AMD due to the low premiums plus expected rise in volume at the time **where it didn't make sense to do a debit spread due to opportunity cost.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBelow is a visual and potential outcome, you can look to see if you had 25 winning trades per year, hence executing more and being responsible is key. So 50 winning trades could be a goal or 25. This is just for motivation and the numbers below isn't compounding based off reinvesting the profits. Obviously as PV grows your trades will become larger if you follow some sort of guidance, like below.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/m6vtw7pp4yd71.png?width=948&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b9d9a6500f3e19d5f3b05a8bb88b867d793e4f5\n\nYou see with the small account you might be wondering..mhmm I should just put $990 in a trade and keep going..right but that will be 20% of your portfolio value meaning all it will take is 5 trades to destroy your account.\n\nThose who built an account to $25,000 or more through trading have some experience but still may be a beginner in trading if they are only executing a few trades a year and go \"lucky\".\n\nThere is even 6 figure professionals, who start off with a large account , think they know how to trade based off their professional 1confidence and risk it all as well without having any proper risk management and business sense.\n\nBut if you feed your portfolio with new capital in the beginning, eat crow, go on defense with expenses and be a student of game putting 25 hours of homework and trading a week, then you can get your goal asap.\n\nPretty Simple stuff but the questions is.. **Do you really want to put in the work?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSidenote: Highly recommend keeping a options journal. I thought I didn't need but ever since I started putting into practice it has been a game changer for honing in my risk management skill.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/564329qq4yd71.png?width=1618&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab0f3eab355d3cfe9e5d7eb747aa4c29f444b365",
        "139":"\ud83d\udc9a Andy on EV Charge Stocks: I Like $EVGO a lot, and it's on sale today! Hi, I'm Andy.\n\n**UPDATE 07\/15**: Posting my position screenshot per request. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/1rf401nq1hb71.png?width=1199&format=png&auto=webp&s=0bb755fad583d2feea6af2ad2be6d76ba5a6f7df\n\nI know next-to-nothing about money markets, but I know a lot about EVs and the car sales industry.\n\nMy small business has put a lot of EVs on the road over the past year, and I am on a **quest to put most, if not all, of my earnings into EV Charging Stations!**\n\nPeople are buying and leasing cars they can\u2019t put gas in, but they still gotta go places, so I want to buy in to the Charge Stations!\n\nI want to buy in to the most convenient charge network: one that delivers a fast charge in convenient places where I\u2019d park anyway.\n\n**Tl\\~dr**: $EVGO went on sale today as they acquired PlugShare.com. The best charging network bought the best site for finding a charger. **I like $EVGO and bought a lot! Then I bought more!** \u2013 Actual EV drivers on the East Coast prefer this charge network. So do [GM](https:\/\/www.evgo.com\/press-release\/general-motors-and-evgo-aim-to-accelerate-widespread-ev-adoption-by-adding-fast-chargers-nationwide\/), [Tesla](https:\/\/www.evgo.com\/press-release\/evgo-further-extends-nations-largest-fast-charging-network-to-tesla-drivers\/), [Nissan](https:\/\/www.evgo.com\/case-studies\/nissan-evgo-five-years-ev-infrastructure-leadership-counting\/), [BMW](https:\/\/www.evgo.com\/press-release\/bmw-helps-ev-drivers-plug-into-evgo-charging-network-for-fast-reliable-and-100-renewable-charging\/), [Ford](https:\/\/media.ford.com\/content\/fordmedia\/fna\/us\/en\/news\/2015\/11\/17\/ford-offers-three-years-complimentary-charging-c-max-energi.html), and the [Biden administration](https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/briefing-room\/statements-releases\/2021\/04\/22\/fact-sheet-biden-administration-advances-electric-vehicle-charging-infrastructure\/). EVgo has the balance of cost-to-install and utility-to-drivers figured out, which is absolutely key to scaling in this industry.\n\n**I don't like $CHPT** \\- I think it's a trap because the product is not very useful in real life, despite being \u201c#1 largest EVSE network in the US\u201d. The more I unravel, the more I realize that this network is more about raising money\/valuation than it is about charging cars and getting drivers on their way.\n\n**BG & Motivation**\n\nPeople will need to charge their cars, and EV adoption is climbing big time, so it seems like investing in charge stations is a great bet, as long as you invest in the right one!\n\nThis idea started because I actually wanted to own my own charge station in a strip mall.. or a Wendy\u2019s parking lot\u2026 or something. My research into that taught me enough about the material costs of electricians and permits\u2026 and thus I have pivoted into trying to buy charge station stock, instead of a physical charge station. (If anyone knows how I can own my own commercial EVSE in strip malls in NJ, please message me! I am interested!)\n\n**Who am I? \\[I try to restrict being a shill to this section\\]**\n\nEveryone is presumed a shill posting investment advice here. Here is my stake: I own and operate a 1-man car lease brokerage LLC. I help connect people that want to lease new Hyundai Cars & SUVs (Electric, Gas, and Hybrid) to authorized dealerships that have those cars at fair prices. I post content (including price guidelines) on car buying\/leasing forums to better educate prospective customers on market conditions when it comes to leasing their new ride. Beyond that, customers can text me, where I charge a $249 brokerage fee to provide a more personal level of service, and an escalation point outside of the dealership. You may have seen enough \u201cdealership horror stories\u201d to understand why I may have a place in the new car market. Frankly, my level of pricing\/process transparency is unique in the US market for new Hyundai vehicles. All that aside, this post isn\u2019t about getting you in a new car today.. it\u2019s about profiting off of charging your car in the future, whatever you buy\/lease and wherever you buy\/lease it from.\n\n**If you look at how important Gas prices have been to the economy\u2026 it\u2019s a no-brainer that EV charging is going to be big money.**\n\nMore chargers will be a necessity, and the lack of enough fast chargers is a potential bottleneck to seeing more new EVs join the road. If there is nowhere to charge the cars, I\u2019m worried that I will lose opportunities to connect prospective customers to new EVs. As an EV driver myself, I find EVgo to be the most convenient app and station network to find a charger, and so I bought a heavy position in CLII before the merger. Today, I bought more as the stock dipped below $11 again!\n\n**Why EVgo is the Best Charge Network for Consumers.**\n\nEVGO stations are, on average, and by my approximation, 30-50x more expensive to install, but charge a car 7x faster \u2013 compared to the average Chargepoint Station. Over 100 miles of range per hour, vs 25 miles of range per hour (again this is on average \u2013 most of Chargepoint\u2019s stations are Level 2).\n\nElectrify America (Volkswagen) does have a few faster stations that are, on average, 100x more expensive to install than ChargePoint Level 2 stations, or 3x+ more expensive to install than EVGO stations. Those stations can charge compatible cars, even faster, [as fast as 160 miles in 22 minutes](https:\/\/media.electrifyamerica.com\/en-us\/releases\/75). but I believe the infrastructure costs will keep those stations at designated sites, major interstates, etc.\n\nEVGO provides that \u201cSweet spot\u201d where its feasible to deploy to the average American strip mall, 50kW charge stations in more places. Per Forbes: [https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/bradtempleton\/2020\/07\/09\/the-future-of-ev-charging-may-be-at-50kw-not-the-gasoline-thinking-of-250kw](https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/bradtempleton\/2020\/07\/09\/the-future-of-ev-charging-may-be-at-50kw-not-the-gasoline-thinking-of-250kw)\n\nAs an EV Driver, it is delightful to pull up to a station that is conveniently near the shops\/business\/attraction you already want to go to, and know your car can add 100 miles of range per hour while you\u2019re parked running your errands. In my opinion, in this business, it\u2019s not about a race to having the fastest charge station in the middle of nowhere where you have to watch Netflix in your car. This is what EVGO gets right, consumer-facing. Fast enough charging in the right places.\n\n**Why EVGO makes sense as an Investment to Me.**\n\nIn addition to a superior charging network, and partnerships with major automotive players, the executive leadership at EVGO has strong ties to the Biden Administration. Biden recently test drove the all-electric F150 with a big smile on his face, so I\u2019m going with the political climate of EVs and EV charge stations to be healthy. Biden also visited an EVgo station recently.\n\nMy philosophy is that even if this dips, people will \\*need\\* to charge their cars, and there\u2019s no way it\u2019s not a solid long-term play. This stock doubled in price when the EVGO\/CLII merger was first announced, but now it\u2019s basically back down to its original valuation, which is what made me feel that now is the time to strike again.\n\nAdditional Facts:\n\n* EVGO is the only 3rd party charge network that displays its own logo in-Dash on charging Teslas (due to partnership with Tesla)\n* EVGO only builds new stations that will be cash-flow positive in 7 years or less, based on their model of EV adoption in given locales.\n\n**Why CHPT is Annoying for Consumers.**\n\nThe problem with Chargepoint is two-fold.\n\n1. Most of their chargers are sloowwww.. but labeled as \u201cLevel 2 fast chargers\u201d (25 miles of range added to your car, per hour plugged in)\n2. \u201cFind a Charger\u201d apps\/GPS\/etc don\u2019t always differentiate charger types when routing, frequently directing EV drivers to shit stations that leave them stranded in parking lots for extreme amounts of time. Frequently, the driver thinks they are going to a \u201cfast charger\u201d \u2013 but their definition of Fast is very different from Chargepoint\u2019s definition of fast.\n\nThe advantage of Chargepoint is: it\u2019s simple & cheap to install. You just need a 240V 40A circuit, such as one for a dryer or air compressor, to add a Chargepoint to your existing building\/lot. If you want to charge faster than this, you need 480V three-phase power. The difference in investment-to-install goes from a $10k job to install one charger to a $300k+ job to install one charger.\n\nThe result is Chargepoint advertises this massive network of chargers, but in reality they\u2019re only useful if they\u2019re at.. say.. a hotel.. where your car will be plugged in overnight. You see these things at supermarkets and hospitals and at strip malls all over, but they only recoup 20-30 miles of range while you\u2019re in the store running your errands, basically negating any benefit after circling a parking lot and finding one to plug in. You also see a bunch of small Boomer town halls getting excited about \u201cbeing part of the future\u201d for installing one ChargePoint L2 [charger](https:\/\/www.kingston-ny.gov\/evstations) in a [municipal](https:\/\/www.kioskmarketplace.com\/news\/connecticut-town-installs-ev-charging-station\/) lot somewhere.\n\nThe best example I can give is, on two different occasions I got stuck on a Chargepoint. My destination was 100 or 200 miles away, but I only had about 30 miles of range left on my car. The nearest Chargepoint was 25 miles away, and the nearest DC Fast Charger was about 50 miles away. I could not make it to the Fast Charger, so I had to divert to a Chargepoint. Since the Chargepoint was a detour, I needed to sit at the Chargepoint to recoup 40 miles of range before I\u2019d be able to make it to the fast charger. So I spent 90 minutes in a hospital parking lot in the middle of nowhere. Then, my car had just enough range to drive to the nearest fast charger. Once I got to the fast charger, another 90 minutes added 300 miles of range to my car. But still, because I was 10 miles short on range getting there, I had no option but to add nearly 3 hours of detour. Over 80% of Chargepoints are useless for getting you any further than the next charging station. Consumers expect the average charge station to perform 10-12x faster than what most of Chargepoint\u2019s fleet provides! (And 10-12x faster than Chargepoint is still a lot slower than getting Gas)\n\n**Why Reddit Has Made me Think CHPT is Also a Scheme.. Financially**\n\nSo this part is inspired by Reddit. I noticed during the height of the GME volatility that there really was enough evidence of some of these \u201cpopular\u201d blogs pushing an anti-GME shill agenda type of thing. I saw that Cramer interview and I took a step back and realized that it did make sense that the companies buying Google Ads to hype stocks might have a financial stake in those values. And sure enough, when you Google for NYSE:CHPT, those same type of sites come up: StockNews, SeekingA\\*pha, InvestorPlace, Motley Fool, etc. These guys are pumping CHPT, and so this is where I can see this alleged shill-blog behavior (could be either ignorant or dishonest) in a market and landscape I actually understand the fundamentals of.\n\nI think about being stuck for 90 minutes at a Chargepoint to add 40 miles of range to make it to an Electrify America where 90 minutes added 300 miles of range and took me home, and I call bullshit on these Pro-$CHPT articles. Thank you, Reddit, and thank you to those sites themselves that tipped off the general public at how they work during the period of peak GME-volatility. That historical information gives me confidence in asking this \\*opinion\\*, and shower thought, \u201cWhat if a large Chargepoint shareholder actually tried to use a Chargepoint Station, got stranded or inconvenienced on the side of the road, and realized that this needs to pump\/dump to get out, thus paying for some media coverage to hype the stock?\u201d\n\nI just don\u2019t want to buy $CHPT because the service isn\u2019t useful to me. The question I\u2019d love to ask anyone that owns that stock is, is the service useful to you? Have you used it to charge your electric car?\n\n**A point on Electrify America (main competitor of EVgo growth)**\n\nWhat not everyone knows is that **Electrify America is a wholly owned subsidiary of Volkswagen, and its existence is punitive, as a result of the Dieselgate settlement**.\n\nThe Electrify America stations are awesome, but also very costly to deploy. 150kW charging needs really beefy transformers and electrical equipment to charge your car that fast. On interstates, 150kW and 350kW charging will be king. But on the more local level, in malls and supermarket and movie theater parking lots, EVGO can install 50kW stations at a fraction of the cost of what VW Group is installing 150kW EA stations at. Electrify America is also a bit of a showcase of the technology, and enables VW to sell more cars like the Porsche Taycan to compete with Tesla. Their end-game is more about interstates than about around-town EV charging. EA\u2019s pricing is also currently regulated as a result of the whole dieselgate fiasco, whereas EVGO\u2019s pricing is not regulated, and the charge station owner is free to mark up the electricity.\n\n**Final Point: EVSEs are more like ATMs than Gas Stations.**\n\nI believe that the EVGO model will ultimately follow the ATM model. An enterprising company will put one in every parking lot that makes sense until there is saturation. At that point, rent and rates can be negotiated between the business\/utility\/ATM owner. Gas Stations are more standalone, whereas the sell of EVSEs is putting them in places that make strategic sense \u2013 where people are already driving and spending 45-120 minutes in one place.\n\nIn Summary, I like $EVGO. I don't like $CHPT. And if you haven\u2019t yet: Try driving an electric car! They\u2019re so much fun to drive as long as you can find a place to charge!\n\nThank you for reading!\n\n\ud83d\udc9a Andy",
        "143":"Let me clear the air here regarding GME, AMC, & CLOV Alright you retards, I'm taking the initiative to clear the air. I'm probably going to get a lot of downvotes, but I'm going to be straight up honest here.\n\nWe are not a team, this is not a cult, and this is not fucking collusion.\n\nGME, AMC, & CLOV are three completely different plays. Stop fucking comparing the 3 with this cult like attitude.\n\n**GME** \\- Was being shorted because as per \"technicals\" it was a company that was going to shit (bankruptcy) if they didn't change leadership and incorporate strategic changes to their business model aka E-Commerce and the like. Additionally, the biggest reason GME picked up in late December\/early January is because it had a ridiculous\/unprecedented short interest of %140. Making the short squeeze extremely likely to occur. The stock picked up, gamma squeeze and short squeezes occurred and it's still the play to this day. Why? because the remaining \\~15-20% short sellers still holding their positions are the same ones from the beginning who have accumulated billions in loses, thus still considered a major play + the company making big changes to their board of directors, adding e-commerce and more etc.\n\n**AMC** \\- This stock sucked dick when it was first picked up. The only reason this stock got picked up was because of nostalgia and because of people missing out on GME. The SI% on AMC back when GME rallied up was well below 20%. This company as well was on the verge of bankruptcy. It got picked up by the supporters like us apes and more shorts loaded in. AMC due to the retail investors \"Picking\" this stock to rally up actually has started to work on their business model and accrued $1B in investments and has started to really concentrate on building the business into a success (hopefully). When the CEO said the talks of bankruptcy are no longer on the table, is because even they knew at the time that filing for bankruptcy was a real possibility for the company. Again, the CEO has fucked over investors in the past by trying to continually dilute the float with adding more shares. On top of that prior to the stocks rallying up the board and CEO's paid themselves handsomely when the company was about to fail. Now, the narrative is different for AMC as the shorts that are in this stock are the same ones from the beginning and have also accrued unrealized losses. Also, seems the company has really pivoted to reconstruct their business model to become a success once COVID-19 is no longer hindering the world from being normal again, thus, making AMC still a very big play.\n\n**CLOV** \\- Was ridiculously shorted the moment it hit IPO. This had nothing to do with GME or AMC. The short interest on CLOV has been there since IPO. The play for CLOV is that it's a Medicare Advantage Disruptor, and provides a real use case and a cost effective solution to the traditional Medicare Advantage sub-segment that hasn't changed in ages. This stock has a large short interest, now probably greater then AMC and GME combined, low float, no debt, and has a very bright future for growth. It's also heavily invested by Alphabet (Google) and other major players. The firms shorting CLOV are not the same as those who shorted GME and AMC, separate that from your minds.\n\nYes, Melvin Capital, Citadel and others targeted GME and AMC, but this has no relevance to CLOV. No one gives a fuck, a viable stock that has a potential to disrupt a market segment that is also heavily shorted is the play for CLOV. That's it, simple as that.\n\nAll 3 of these stocks are completely different plays. Yes, a short squeeze and\/or gamma squeeze will always be appreciated on any stock. But get this through your heads, THEY ARE NOT THE SAME PLAY! They are completely different in respect to each other.\n\nWSB is a casino, we're here to place bets and hope for the best. This is not a team sport, this is not a cult, and this is not collusion.\n\nIf you don't like a stock, then don't throw money at it. But stop with the shilling and the cult attitude predominantly from GME and AMC diehards that can't grasp that WSB is a casino and not a subreddit solely about GME or AMC. (I'm not talking about GME and AMC holders as a whole, most of you are chill af, just some that are constantly shilling everything with a ticker thats not GME or AMC).\n\nNow with this shit said, I'm a big supporter of all 3. But for fuck sakes they are not the same play, stop comparing the 3.\n\nDon't forget AMC dropped to $6 and AMC bagholders were bag holding for months before it moved. GME dropped to $40 and GME holders were bag holding for months before it moved.\n\nEveryone needs to chill the fuck out, play your plays and keep it moving. Stop shilling shit and comparing shit when they're not correlated at all.\n\nBB and NOK became \"Meme\" stocks because fundamentally, they were undervalued for what the company actually does and where they're positioning themselves for the future.\n\nPeople just need to stop comparing and having these debates. 3 stocks, 3 completely different plays, fuck off and throw your money at which ever stocks you like and hope for the best, just stop with the comparisons and cult shit it's ridiculous.\n\nAlso, the short squeeze is nowhere near in sight. You think the short sellers are dumb as fuck? They're going to wait until inflation hits and fucks up the whole market. They're probably betting that once the market goes tits up, people bag holding these stocks will sell, why? Because they anticipate people will need to pay for bills, mortgages\/rent, their children etc, and with the cost of living, cost of commodities inflating due to inflation, I can easily see how they're going to hold onto their positions (shorting these stocks) until this occurs. They're banking that when shit goes tits up, the investors in these stocks will also go tits up and FUD will kick in causing massive selloffs. (My personal opinion).\n\nSome plays on WSB are value plays, short squeeze plays, gamma squeeze plays, undervalued plays, oversold plays, etc the fucking list goes on.\n\nWSB is a god damn casino, so treat it as such. I wish you all the best and many tendies, regardless of what you're invested in. Downvote me to oblivion, idgaf.\n\n**Important update**: I want to say thanks to everyone for the awards, upvotes and comments.\n\nI want to clarify some FUD here after the traction from this post. When I was referring to \\~15-20% short sellers for GME I **was not** referring to short interest or the \"naked\" shorts everyone is talking about. Simply, that the original short sellers that are still in their positions haven't closed out their positions yet, same goes for AMC, and the big MOASS that everyone is mentioning is not what I meant when I said gamma squeeze or short squeezes. I was simply referring to when GME spiked to $438 and months after again to $330. I wasn't talking about the big MOASS.\n\nI've been on WSB since December 2020 but only joined on January 28th, 2021 when I felt like I wanted to start to contribute myself. I was here before there was 500k members. I used to only use reddit to view posts and discussion and never really felt the need to create an account until I found stock\/investment subreddits etc. Hopefully this clears some shit up. Again, the purpose of this post was to explain why these 3 stocks are not the same and shouldn't be compared to each other and for people to stop shilling others and having this \"cult\" like attitude\/behaviour.\n\nOh! and the reason why my post mentions GME, AMC, CLOV is because it was the 3 top tickers on the thread for the day this post was made, 07\/06\/2021.\n\nCheers,",

Let's make next week LZB week on Wall Street.\n\nHello everyone,\n\nI just made an options play yesterday on LZB (La-Z-Boy) that I think is very exciting so I'll share it here.\n\nI bought:\n\n$45 call options exp July '21\n\nCurrent stock price is $37.85.\n\nTL;DR\/Reasons\n\n* **Market cap = $1.66B = Same as GME and AMC in January 2021.**\n* **Down nearly 15% over the last 2 days despite earnings beat on all metrics simply due to current global supply chain issues.**\n* **Now trading 33% below fair value of $53.39 as per Nasdaq.com**\n* **Last time stock traded near current $36 support level was after last major dump on February 1. Stock recovered to $41 (10%+) by February 8 and hit $45 (20%+) by March 12.**\n* **As per June 15 earnings report, orders are currently backlogged at record levels for all products due to record demand.**\n* **Trailing 12 months P\/E ratio = 14.31 = Now cheaper than furniture industry average of 17.67 for this iconic brand!**\n\nLong version\/full DD\n\nAfter the 10 bagger+ successes of GME & AMC I think Reddit is ready for a new 10 bagger. I have looked long and hard for that opportunity and I think it is LZB. Why? This stock has everything Reddit needs!\n\n1. **LZB has extremely low market cap so it is easy to trade up the ticker -** LZB market cap is about the same as GME and AMC in January of this year before the mega pumps in price! Even without Reddit involvement this stock is pretty much guaranteed to go up from here as per [Entrepreneur.com](https:\/\/www.entrepreneur.com\/article\/374743) but if Redditors start buying this up this is EASILY the next ten bagger due to the low market cap.\n2. **It is trading well below fair value after being dumped over the past 2 days -** [Nasdaq.com](https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/an-intrinsic-calculation-for-la-z-boy-incorporated-nyse%3Alzb-suggests-its-21-undervalued) published an article yesterday saying the stock was trading 21% below value when it was trading at $42. Now it is at $36, the long-term support, which makes it 33% below fair value! Why did it dump? In their earnings call, they issued a warning about a temporary negative impact to profit margins in the short-term due to raw material price increases right now. However, they also said these issues will be offset by previously announced pricing actions as the company works through its immense backlog in the back half of the year. So basically, the dump is a super overreaction as their earnings report came out the same day J Powell did his press conference and caused the whole market to dump.\n3. **The stock will recover soon because it does this -** Because this stock has low market cap any news causes a dump that soon recovers. Simply looking at the chart over the past 6 months will show other such instances including the last major dump to this support level on February 1 and the subsequent recovery by 10%+ in only 8 days and a 20%+ recovery in just over a month after that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4. [**Forbes.com**](https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/warrenshoulberg\/2021\/06\/15\/la-z-boy-q4-proves-home-is-where-the-money-is\/) **notes that LZB is the poster child for the boom in home furnishings sales** \\- Some quotes for those that don't want to click through to the Forbes story -\n\n>If you want to know how real the boom in home furnishings sales is and how much America is spending to make their homes nicer, all you have to do is ask La-Z-Boy.  \nBy one measurement that the company uses, \u201cwritten same-store sales\u201d for the entire Galleries network doubled, increasing 100% for the quarter. For the year, those sales were up 31%.\n\nTheir CEO noted the following in the earnings call (also covered at Forbes) -\n\n>For the fiscal 2021 fourth quarter, record sales led to all-time record profits driven by increased production capacity, excellent performance by our company-owned La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries stores, and continued growth and profitability at Joybird.  \nFiscal 2022 is off to a great start with continued robust written order rates and a record backlog, setting us up well for a strong year of shipments ahead.\n\n5. **LZB beat on all important metrics including EPS and revenue as per their June 15 earnings report**\n\n6. **And yet this iconic king of furniture brands is currently cheaper than the furniture industry average thanks to this dump**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf Reddit gets interested in this low cap stock I expect it to go to the moon. I recommend getting in like I did. Best of luck and don't forget to buy one of these with your tendies\"\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nLastly, I want to add that the analysts covering LZB have all maintained and or raised their price targets into the 50s. The lowest price target is 46 which would still be a nice gain from where we are now.\n\nLZB has strong potential in the short and long term in my opinion. For a fantastic earnings beat, the drop in price was an overreaction, I think it will bounce. As always do your own DD and see you all on the damn moon!",
        "151":"$WEN DD - Morty's! Not financial advice, this is completely retarded, and a mix of research from myself and other WSB apes.\n\nThe post that started it all -\n\n[https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/nudcrm\/to\\_the\\_guy\\_who\\_recommended\\_wendys\\_stockwen\\_proper\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/nudcrm\/to_the_guy_who_recommended_wendys_stockwen_proper\/)\n\n[u\/Chillznday](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/u\/Chillznday\/), pointed out to us the first sign of Wen Moon potential - The Wendy\u2019s Summer Salad, the best salad of the summer as certified by salad experts. \u201cOnly Wendy's can bring to life this sweet and savory culinary creation with quality ingredients like hand-picked strawberries, crisp Applewood smoked bacon, savory Tuscan cheese blend topped with a sweet and tangy Champagne Vinaigrette\u2013all on top of a bed of freshly chopped lettuce and spring mix for a sweet and savory experience.\u201d I bought into [u\/Chillznday](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/u\/Chillznday\/)\u2019s vision the second I read his wonderful and educated DD, as did many of you.\n\nOnce all you apes caught wind of the glorious summer salad, we had a glorious jump to an ATH of almost $30 with a 90M daily volume. Cramer tried to be cool and ruined the momentum, and Wendy\u2019s insiders dumped large portions of their holdings for a quick profit. $WEN is now back to its pre-WSB share price and volume at about $23 with a daily volume of around 2 million. I have doubled down my long position ($35C 1\/21\/22) in preparation for the $WEN moon.\n\nNow, I still believe $WEN has the potential to be a meme stock. I think it perfectly suits this sub. (tendies, \u201csir this is a wendy\u2019s\u201d, and our favorite employer of WSB members, to name a few examples.) But if you morons think this is going to be another short squeeze like GME or AMC, you\u2019re wrong. This is an undervalued, solid stock that has real sustainable future potential as-is, and the Summer Salad is just the beginning.\n\n[Wendy's Bourbon Bacon Cheeseburger](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/vunzws2hw3771.jpg?width=678&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1b61841fb4b6fe0cfdfbe0a121d0e5880ff8f874)\n\nFirst, the Bourbon Bacon Cheeseburger. This thing looks delicious. It tastes delicious. It\u2019s one of the best burgers ever sold by Wendy\u2019s, certified by me, a burger enthusiast who has tasted numerous burgers. And it\u2019s a huge step in the right direction for where the higher-quality dining menu of this establishment is headed. The quality of the food is going up, as are the prices. That leads to higher revenue. In combination with the Summer Salad, Wendy\u2019s looks like it\u2019s on track to beat expectations in their next earnings release.\n\nSecond, Analyst ratings and predictions. Right now, it\u2019s at 60% buy and 40% hold. Analysts believe Wendy\u2019s is a BUY, with the most recent rating from Northland Securities rating it a buy with a price target of $30. Here\u2019s a link to some recent analyst ratings. [https:\/\/www.marketbeat.com\/instant-alerts\/nasdaq-wen-a-buy-or-sell-right-now-2021-06-2-3\/](https:\/\/www.marketbeat.com\/instant-alerts\/nasdaq-wen-a-buy-or-sell-right-now-2021-06-2-3\/)\n\nThird, the Rick and Morty advertising campaign - two internet favorites and the perfect mix of meme and undervalued stock. The Morty\u2019s pop-up restaurant drew in a lot of attention on social media, and the Rick and Morty-themed drinks \"Mello Yello BerryJerryboree\" and \"Mello Yello Portal Time Lemon Lime\" are available at more than 5,000 US Wendy's locations throughout the duration of the release of Rick and Morty season 5. As hype for Rick and Morty returns, Wendy\u2019s is set to profit from a large increase in demand for their BerryJerryboree and Portal Time Lemon Lime with the average restaurant profit margin of over 70% on soda sales.\n\n*Processing img ii8umcplw3771...*\n\nhttps:\/\/www.cnet.com\/news\/wendys-rick-and-morty-drinks-taste-like-candy-and-interdimensional-adventure\/\n\nFourth, Wendy\u2019s is opening stores in the UK. \u201c\\[Wendy\u2019s\\] plans to open hundreds of restaurants in the next several years, according to a company spokesman\u201d. As Wendy\u2019s becomes more available to our European brothers and COVID recovery progresses, we\u2019re sure to see huge increases in profits internationally.\n\n[https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/brits-queue-up-for-new-wendys-as-american-fast-food-invades-u-k-11623153601](https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/brits-queue-up-for-new-wendys-as-american-fast-food-invades-u-k-11623153601)\n\nFifth, Wendy\u2019s Breakfast. I\u2019m sure by now you\u2019ve heard that Wendy\u2019s has breakfast. It\u2019s pretty good, and since the inception of Wendy\u2019s breakfast last year it has accounted for 7% of their total sales, and is predicted to reach 10% by 2022.\n\n[https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2021\/03\/03\/business\/wendys-breakfast-sales\/index.html](https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2021\/03\/03\/business\/wendys-breakfast-sales\/index.html)\n\nAnd finally, Wendy\u2019s social media activity is still the biggest draw for meme potential for $WEN. According to an actual scientific study done on The Wendy's Twitter account, \u201cCreative humour and corporate communication norm violation promote the company's positive image and high user engagement.\u201d In other words, being funny and \u201cnot like other companies\u201d on social media is the most progressive advertising form that Wendy\u2019s has adopted, and it\u2019s worked extremely well, to the point of other companies following suit and copying the Wendy\u2019s example. Wendy\u2019s has had interactions with other big meme stocks on twitter as well, such as GameStop. If Wendy\u2019s Twitter would acknowledge WSB and their retail investors, it would be met with a lot of enthusiasm. If we could gain enough traction, I could see us getting some free frostys.\n\nThe scientific study is available to read here - [https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0378216620301120](https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0378216620301120)\n\nWendy\u2019s is undervalued, according to both analysts and WSBers. There is a lot of potential. Analyst price targets are around $30, and another WSB user compared McDonald\u2019s and Wendy\u2019s and came up with a valuation of $50+ per share, based on revenue and market cap data. [u\/amerikayo](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/u\/amerikayo\/) posted their comparison to McDonald\u2019s valuation that is worth reading here - [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/nvapjt\/wen\\_dd\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/nvapjt\/wen_dd\/)\n\nTLDR; WEN moon is inevitable.

        "154":"Boring Stock to the Moon! Buy Macy's! Been lurking here and tired of seeing the same old GME, BB, CLOV, PLTR etc.  So how about an oldie but a goodie?\n\nYou\u2019re probably wondering why you should listen to some random guy on reddit who does not have diamond hands and doesn\u2019t post regularly on this forum. Well, you shouldn\u2019t. But you\u2019re lazy and do not want to do your own research. I am not in finance by trade, in fact, I am more of a real estate analyst than anything but I took an interest in equities and have an entire library worth of books from the classics such as Buffet\u2019s mentor Benjamin Graham, etc.. so of course you can take my word for it.\n\n**What Macy\u2019s is NOT.** **Why are the Shorts and Analysts\u2019 wrong?**\n\nI came to write **about Why the Shorts have it wrong on this one.** **As of May 28th, It\u2019s 17.8% short**!? Which I just do not understand. Besides the fact that they have a freaking awesome fireworks show on the Hudson river every year, they are basically an anchor tenant in every single mall. This is not JC Penny or Sears. **This company is holding 1.8 Billion in** **cash and not going anywhere**. Yes, malls have been on the beatdown because of the pandemic, but things are coming back and they\u2019re coming back fast.\n\nThis is not just a GME type company who is going to benefit solely from the shorts being squeezed and forced to buy back their positions at a higher price. This is a company that has been around for a long time with a solid business model and fundamentals.\n\nThe 1st quarter for 2021, Macy\u2019s beat out the earnings estimates from analysts by a huge margin yet a lot of them are still bearish on the company.  They reported their adjusted earnings of 39 cents per share which beat out Zack\u2019s Analyst Consensus of -41 cents. The analysts\u2019 had it wrong then and they still have it wrong now. Macy\u2019s has taken a beating this past month, which is a good thing if you want to buy the stock on the cheap.\n\n**Pent up Demand for Shopping**\n\nIf you\u2019re going to follow guys like Peter Lynch who talk about how you can beat wall-street just with your eyes. Go ahead and head down to your local Macy\u2019s and see it for yourself. You have the information with your eyes before Wallstreet can enter those numbers on a spreadsheet. Have you been to any malls lately? If you haven\u2019t, I\u2019ll tell you that they are absolutely packed.\n\nMacy\u2019s sales surged 56% year over-year last quarter yet sales are still down due to the pandemic so there is still room for upside. As offices re-open, people are going to start shopping again for their work clothes, etc. which is a key market for Macy\u2019s.\n\nUsually industry stocks move in lock-step with one another (a rising tide will lift all boats) and the retail sector is no exception. According to Zack\u2019s Industry Rank, the retail segment ranks 9 out of 250 industries meaning retail is going to be in pretty good shape. Analysts are starting to warm up a little bit over the past month by revising the earnings\u2019 estimate for the stock but of course you\u2019re going to want to get in earlier rather than later. They have revised the estimates from -19 cents to +13 cents per share for the quarter and from $0.76 cents to $2.15 per share for the year.\n\nThey have their Credit Card \/ Loyalty program, a major source of income for them, which added 1.7 million members. In addition to their retail operations with Macy\u2019s, Bloomingdale\u2019s, they are also investing heavily in their online segment which will be an additional area of growth\/sales for them as their 47% of their 4.6 million new customers came in digitally.\n\nEDIT: Also, the owner of the Carolina Panthers David Tepper bought in January.  I don't have Diamond Hands, but this dude sure does.\n\nSo all in all, not only am I supporting by buying stock, I\u2019m also going to rack up some money on my Macy\u2019s card.  What do you all think?\n\nDisclosures: Do not own Macy\u2019s stock but do plan to buy.",

What has happened since then?  All kinds of crazy shit.  (So it goes with options.)\n\nSimilarly to back then, I now have an impressive 1 month chart and not-so-impressive all-time chart, so I thought it was a fitting time to give an update.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[1 month chart](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/4wrwsgcnbh671.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e5efada36b1d7ce9648acad0590a85431efbe3d8)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[All-time chart](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/zmhx543rbh671.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8877a8cdc96cdac0e6203f5b52b57eeb18c33d6f)\n\nAfter I made my post, my account shot up to nearly +$90k.  I actually think it went over $90k, but Robinhood's all-time chart isn't very exact on the numbers.  (Side note: one thing I want to mention about these charts is that the percentages are not accurate according to my account value at the time because I have been depositing over the years... For example, when I was +$90k here, that was actually around a 200% gain at the time, not a 92% gain.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[My all-time high](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/hoqqy1ptbh671.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=36b8115cbe938a2d0fa2ec3b66aa7812dc296e76)\n\nHow did I get so many gains?  Well, this was a long time ago, and I make hundreds of trades per year, so I will just focus on some of the highlights in this post and hopefully that'll be good enough for the mods.  My biggest gains during this time were $AMZN calls prior to the 2020 crash and $INO calls and $SPY puts during the crash.\n\nHere's a screenshot I took of one of my $AMZN positions:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[AMZN gain 1\\\/31\\\/2020](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/q2aqy7ixbh671.jpg?width=1439&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b413b81186cca063745a7c9f6c21c6025addb1fb)\n\nHere's a $10k $INO gain:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[INO gain 3\\\/3\\\/2020](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/4iih5wwybh671.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7108da399df140c2677500a49fb5365c41ccff56)\n\nWell, I'm sure you saw that my gains didn't last, and I imagine you're thinking I lost them all during the 2020 crash.  Yes and no.  As I mentioned, I made a lot of money on SPY puts during the crash (I likely didn't screenshot these because it was a bunch of small, quick trades).  I actually only made money during the initial crash and completely dodged that bullet.  So what did happen?  Well, after the stock market rebounded significantly from the bottom, I bet heavily that it would go back down.  And well, as you know, it didn't.  So I lost all of my massive gains to $TSLA and $SPY puts after the rebound only kept going up.  I managed to find a screenshot of some of those losses:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Some SPY put losses 4\\\/8\\\/2020](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/q6xvm1hdch671.jpg?width=1426&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=db354d6bb5cea7b9dd4b081ee2abc9bf57d6da45)\n\nOnce I lost all of my gains, I just sold everything and took a break from risky trading.  You can see the chart is mostly sideways for 6 months before it plummets again.  This plummet I lost over $60k, even more than my old losses that I crawled back from.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[New all-time low](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/3d30zf4vdh671.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2da69f1e157782c71906ab00e39a701006ccf2c3)\n\nSo how did I get those massive losses again?  Well, in late 2020\/early 2021 I lost to $TSLA puts and $GME calls.  Both of these were good buys, I just sold them too soon.  My TSLA puts were bought when TSLA was over $800, but I got impatient and sold a few weeks before it would've made me money.  GME... Well, I don't want to talk about GME.  I sold just before it went crazy.  My position would have made me a millionaire.  I took a screenshot of my position before I sold because I had a feeling I would regret it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[GME position 12\\\/9\\\/2020](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/zknq2bklch671.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e6ac53d8bbc8970c5c322b4ae27d68ede8ea613d)\n\nI bought in on the GME squeeze thesis posted here in WSB, and I still believed in it at the time I sold.  But I had commented here that I was in on it, and I started to worry about the legality of it and decided it wasn't worth it.  What an idiotic decision.\n\nThe TSLA puts and GME calls weren't actually the majority of my losses, though.  That honor goes to my next position, $PFE calls.  This was actually another well-timed buy that went wrong because I sold too soon.   I bought PFE almost exactly at the bottom in late Feb stock-wise, but as the stock kept rising, my options kept deteriorating.  Eventually, I couldn't handle watching my options and account fall to near zero while the stock kept rising, and I gave up and sold.  Had I held on another week, I would have made all of my money back.  Another 2 weeks, and I would have had big gains.  I didn't screenshot this disaster and would have to dig through my history for details, but I feel like no one would care to have these details.  Suffice to say it was about 1,000 call options the decayed despite upward stock movement.\n\nAnd thankfully, I made back all of my losses anyway, as you can see from my all-time chart.  After all of my disasters, I decided I was done with short-term trading and was just going to invest via LEAPs in some high growth companies.  So I did some DD and bought LEAPs on companies I thought were undervalued, most notably $SPCE, $XPEV, and $WISH.  I bought these planning to hold long term and didn't expect these would rocket higher immediately after I bought them.\n\nI didn't screenshot full positions, but here are some of the trades in my history if you feel you need proof for the recent gains.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[SPCE buys](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/fr4u3i62dh671.png?width=716&format=png&auto=webp&s=9019221417f56ce97cb827ae25540d2c18820cd8)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[SPCE sells](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/7fb30dt3dh671.png?width=712&format=png&auto=webp&s=8bd46e160981d9bea69e7be2199acc6fda5f5ba3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[XPEV buys](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/6vhafze8dh671.png?width=714&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc543ee9d002978c3ba8e75bff0c7ff682fbf5e1)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[XPEV sells](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/pco0yzy9dh671.png?width=727&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb209ac22850b9a5f3fab10029ca2eea2347a5a3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[WISH gains](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/doe68wjgdh671.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=826e8870c8389a81aa95ee2dab83ce5df38e864c)\n\n(I made more money than is shown in these screenshots; again, they're not the full positions.)\n\nI also liked someone's DD here of $CLOV, and decided to take a small position in CLOV as well.  This screenshot is just before selling, so luckily I held onto these gains:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[$4.5k into $31k.  Nuts.](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/dm35dtkldh671.jpg?width=1437&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c3593cc7ecb91f46b4455ff8fa8655f4ef8652d7)\n\nI closed most of these positions.  So where am I now?\n\nActually, I'm back heavily in $WISH.  Here's my current WISH position:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[WISH current position](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/g0hywmp2eh671.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4a08b1cf153dae3812d85292e5e7b06e9045a4f4)\n\n(These screenshots are from Thursday but they're close to the same value now).  I could go into detail telling you why I like WISH so much right now, but there are plenty of DD posts to be found.  What it boils down to is that this thing is still at less than half of its IPO value, and I think it's severely oversold for a growing e-commerce site, regardless of what some people might think of the products.  You think the quality of products is too cheap to be successful, I'll just kindly point you in the direction of $DG and its chart.  Note I bought a lot of WISH shares here even though I don't usually buy shares.  The premium on WISH options is a bit high, and I'm trying to chill out a bit after my massive unexpected gains this last month.\n\nI also have smaller positions in $ACAD, $AYX, $QS, and $RUN.  I like a lot of other stocks right now, but I just have my money tied up currently.  For example, I want to start new positions in $PLTR, $OPEN, $SNOW, $F, $AEVA, and $VIEW when I get a chance.  I also want to get back in $SPCE and $XPEV if I get a dip, as well as hoping for a dip in some others like $DIS and $DDD, and a ton of other companies whose stocks are just too expensive for me at the current moment.  I also don't think you'd be wrong to be into metals, especially nickel.  Hopefully I haven't mentioned any banned tickers here.  There are a lot of multibagger opportunities out there right now, imo, assuming hyperinflation and rising interest rates + QT don't cause a massive bear market, of course.\n\nAlthough I feel like I'm decent at this, I also felt like I was decent at it before I lost $150k in 2020 and 2021 from high to low.  To be fair to myself, the measures the government and Fed took to prop up the market\/economy were unprecedented when I bought those SPY puts, and most of the recent losses on TSLA and PFE were good buys but bad sells (i.e, sold too early).  But that doesn't change that I ultimately made a bad trade.  Anyway, you can ask me for options or trading advice and I'll try to answer, but honestly right now I'm still not feeling the most qualified.\n\nOne last thing, a lot of people down $50k (which was like 90% of my account at the time) or my recent $65k losses would have thrown in the towel on options completely.  I'm proof you can turn it around... I've done it twice now.  That said, I'm also proof that you can lose it all quickly in the options world.  I wouldn't advise most people to do this.  I have separate retirement funds, college funds for my children, and make a decent living with a relatively secure job.  I would be okay if I lost it all.  This is just me trying to win a ticket to early retirement.  But don't do it if you can't afford to lose it.",
        "160":"ViacomCBS - VIAC, the only real deep value left in this market Okie dokie. So here goes. This past year has been insanity, and I think it has caused quite a bit of disillusionment and will also be detrimental to many bank accounts as we move increasingly closer to higher inflation and a rising rate environment. Hear me out.\n\nSo, some context, following my trading style, I was all over GME in late August when Cohen released his 13D; GME was already on my radar because of Burry, who's investing\/trading style I try to mimic. DFV\/Roaring Kitty, Rod, and others were also a big inspiration in spreading good, solid DD. It was a true deep value play. When GME released its Q2 2020 results on September 8th, it was terrifying, because we dropped almost back below $6; however, one thing shined through, and that was the almost $1 billion in free cash flow (fcf). The big push after that ER drop of course was the Microsoft partnership. That showed exactly how committed the console vendors were to keeping GME in business - making a console is actually not profitable, its the sales after the console, and GME is a huge part in reducing Customer Acquisition Costs for console vendors. Of course the SI was always the big thing - 140%, but it wasn't what made many of us have \"diamond hands\", it was the business, and its crucial role in the gaming industry - hell, what made Burry go deep in GME? When he got confirmation that the new console cycle would include disc drives. Anyways, my whole point is this - what made GME, GME, was its deep value, that it was, in the infamous words of Burry - \"A long term franchise trading at a significant discount from growing intrinsic value.\" Which, always, is the preference when you are looking for the best possible trade to execute.\n\nSo what does this have to do with ViacomCBS - VIAC? Well, it is precisely that, it is a long term franchise trading at a significant discount from growing intrinsic value. How so? Ok, first, the basic test is this: what is its margin of safety based on discounted cash flow analysis (dcf); what is its enterprise value divided by earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization (ev\/ebitda); and what is its price\/free cash flow. This basic first pass test shows VIAC has: 49% margin of safety, 8.0 ev\/ebitda, and 7.8 price to free cash flow. These are all really, really good for what is a long term franchise; and they have over $3 billion in fcf, a big fat number. Yes, debt is $19 billion, but they have total assets of $54 billion. Oh yeah, p\/e is 9.8, which is not, in my opinion, the best metric for value, but its pretty damn good.\n\nOk, so they pass the basic deep value screener. But the real clincher is this. They aren't just \"value\" but are also showing GROWTH. Burry pounds this home, and he learned it from Graham & Dodd and Buffet. You don't look for just \"value\" or \"growth\", you find BOTH. So how is VIAC doing this? Well, look at how aggressive management is with their streaming strategy, which they are being extremely aggressive. First, we know they released Paramount+ in March, rebranding CBS All Access. Was it good, no. It was shit. However, they made it clear they are, and did, improve it. They recently dropped 1,000 movies, will drop a new movie every week starting in 2022, and, importantly, they will CEASE to license their content to third party streamers. No more movies\/shows going to Netflix\/Amazon. Besides CBS and Paramount Studios, VIAC owns Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, BET, MTV, CMT, VH1, and several other networks that have hugely popular series. When they get all of that content exclusive to Paramount+, woah. For instance, look at Disney+, it took them about a year to get all the Marvel and Star Wars movies all centralized on Disney+, and when they did, subs went through the roof. Better believe ViacomCBS will get ALL their HUGE number of big movies and shows streaming exclusively to Paramount+. This is a big deal. Of course VIAC owns Showtime (doesn't hurt to mention they had the huge Mayweather PPV event this quarter) and between Paramount+, Showtime and BET+, they have 36 million monthly active users (MAUs). I think we will also see a bundle of Paramount+ and Showtime, and they just released an extremely cheap and competitive limited ad service for Paramount+ for $4.99. They are also being extremely aggressive with international markets - you know, the other billions and billions outside the United States.\n\nThen there is Pluto TV, their AVOD (ad video on demand, Paramount+ is an SVOD, subscription on demand) free TV streaming service, literally free, and excellent, check it out if you haven't. They paid $300 million for it back in 2019; it now has over 55 million global monthly active users (MAUs) and rising. AVODs are the future, and it is projected Pluto will bring in ONE BILLION in ad rev by 2022. That is huge. Also, over the top (OTT) advertising is the future, and ViacomCBS owns the best OTT technology. OTT is basically this, based on your browsing history, connected devices, they will target you with ads that might be of interest to you, not simply the ads that everyone sees. This is the way all advertising will go, and VIAC is leading the way with one of the biggest free AVOD services, Pluto TV. Finally, Pluto TV is a \"super funnel\" to Paramount+. Everyone in the streaming business will tell you, the gold standard is to have a strong AVOD and SVOD, and that is what VIAC has.\n\nThen of course there is Paramount Studios. They just had the highest grossing movie of the pandemic, A Quiet Place II. But even more important, the studio is fully reopened and in full production. Huge. Then of course CBS. Sure, older viewing audience, but don't balk at that. They have 6 of the top 10 shows in primetime TV. That is HUGE ad revenue. Also this quarter they had March Madness Finals, Masters, and the PGA Tour Finals that Mickelson won. Then they have the NFL, Champions League, and so much more in terms of sports, as well as the number one news network. All that can be streamed live on Paramount+. That is just more growth, more revenue, and advantages other streaming services don't have.\n\nThe real important point is this however: VIAC is the second largest content creator in the world, second only behind Disney. That is right, the second largest producer of shows, movies, and sports. In fact, that is all they do. They aren't a cable or phone company, they don't run an amusement park. They just make content, and content is KING in the streaming business, which is where we are all moving towards. They are the only major content producer that is vertically integrated that is left standing - i am not going to talk about merger and acquisition rumors, but Shari Redstone is more amenable to selling than we all think - and it makes VIAC incredibly valuable, incredibly valuable: VERTICALLY INTEGRATED. That means they don't just produce content, but they can distribute it via their own networks. MGM, bought by Amazon recently, was not vertically integrated. Now, when you look at their market cap, $26 billion, relative to all the content they own and their networks to distribute that content, they are INSANELY undervalued. Bottom line, this is a rare event, like GME was.\n\nIf you're getting concerned about what is happening in this market, what has happened over the last year, and get a feeling the \"party\" is about to end. Look even more into VIAC. I'm not going to pander and say I am a retarded autistic ape who eats crayons. However I do eat a shitload of chicken tenders.",

If anyone knows how help me out. I'm not new to Reddit but I'm old (40s) and haven't used it in years so I lost my username lol.\"  -Posted for user: u\/TeddyPayne12\n\nI'm a former hedge fund trader who left the business years ago to pursue a more meaningful career, aka I've been poor ever since \ud83d\ude02 No but for real \ud83d\ude2d Started trading seriously again last year when the market crashed and did fairly well. Loving this Ape era, missed GME but still holding some AMC calls!\n\nI'm super bullish on $TWNK for 2 reasons (with a bunch of sub-reasons): because I believe in its **value** (analysis below) and it's a double play trade for **speculation**.\n\n**1. VALUE**\n\nthere's very little downside risk in the stock, which makes it a perfect pure equity play (buy the stock)-OR-you can buy-write it all day long (buy stock and sell equivalent number of calls, so you collect the premium and make a great return PLUS you put a stop-loss order on your downside so you can't lose a penny).\n\n*EXAMPLE OF BUY-WRITE*: TWNK closed at $16.50 last night. The July $17.50 calls were $1. If you buy 100 shares of the stock for $16.50 and sell 1 option contract at $1, you've spent $1,550 total (100 x $16.50 for stock) minus (1 x 100 x $1 for calls) = $1,550.\n\n1. If the stock goes to $17.50 or above -- the contract will be exercised, so you'll have no position left but you'll have just made another $100, making $200 on your $1,550 which is 13% in a month(!)\n2. If the stock hovers in between $16.50 and $17.50 -- you sell at whatever price it ends at, add that to your $100 from selling the calls and that's your profit -OR- you sell the next month's calls and collect more profit while the stock hovers\n3. If the stock goes down then you just set a stop-loss limit order at whatever price you don't want to go below and you'll lock in profits\/minimize losses (since you're protected on price down to $15.50 from selling the calls)\n\nRegarding TWNK value, there have been some posts in the past 1 week to 4 months that did a pretty good job so I won't repeat them here but take a look then I'll tell you what I think.\n\n1)[https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/nxinqq\/hostess\\_twnk\\_is\\_a\\_sleeping\\_giant\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/nxinqq\/hostess_twnk_is_a_sleeping_giant\/)\n\n2)[https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/nw3a0r\/why\\_im\\_balls\\_deep\\_in\\_twnk\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/nw3a0r\/why_im_balls_deep_in_twnk\/)\n\n3)[https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/nz073d\/hostess\\_brands\\_twnk\\_followup\\_to\\_my\\_long\\_thesis\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/nz073d\/hostess_brands_twnk_followup_to_my_long_thesis\/)\n\n4)[https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/nvhe4k\/hostess\\_is\\_it\\_time\\_to\\_go\\_balls\\_deep\\_in\\_twnk\\_for\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/nvhe4k\/hostess_is_it_time_to_go_balls_deep_in_twnk_for\/)\n\nHere's what I'll add:\n\n1. **Possible news TODAY**: investor meeting at Evercore ISI Consumer and Retail Summit ([webcast here](https:\/\/www.hostessbrands.com\/events\/event-details\/evercore-isi-consumer-retail-summit))\n2. It consistently beats market expectations\n3. Upcoming summer season with more drivers on the road and sky high post-pandemic travel expected will boost sales, which are driven by convenience stores and through which they have a \"differentiated distribution model that gives Hostess unique access\" per Morningside analyst report\n4. It has consistently beaten market expectations and added value for investors ever since it re-emerged as a \\*brand new company\\* after bankruptcy -- not a reorg of the old one. Per one analyst report: \"After the 2012 bankruptcy, investors purchased only the brand rights and recipes from the bankruptcy court, freeing them of employee benefits and other labor obligations that had weighed down the company in the past.\"\n\n**SPECULATION**\n\nAbove are my reasons for *investing* in $TWNK, but below are my reasons I am *trading* it right now.\n\nIf people decided this was the new meme stock, it would be a wild ride -- it's 17% shorted per the latest report (5\/28) and trades on very little volume -- around a million shares a day normally with 131 million shares outstanding. By comparison, AMC traded about 5 \\*million\\* shares a day before all this craziness happened, with 450 million shares outstanding and 22% short interest. GME traded about 3 million shares a day on 72 million shares outstanding and 20% short interest.\n\nBecause of the volume -- it's short ratio is super high -- 20.15 as of today, which means it would take shorts 20 days to cover. That makes it about as ripe for a short squeeze as a stock can get.\n\n**BOTTOM LINE**\n\nCan't really find a reason why not to buy the stock, or at least buy-write it and protect yourself on the downside. If people pile into it -- we could be talking about serious money if the stock pops.\n\nDisclosure\n\nI am long TWNK stock and I have a covered call position worth about 5% of my portfolio, which is nothing big (\\~$80k lol)\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThis is not financial advice and I am not a financial advisor.",
        "162":"DD on BBBY: grotesquely over-shorted stonk with great fundamentals compared to competitors I'm not going to talk about BBBY's new management that's turning the company around (just like in GME!), or that 32% of its float has been shorted (that's pretty ridiculous all by itself) - I'll just post some fundamentals for y'all to look at and make your own conclusions:\n\n1.

A lot of Wall Street types seem to like BBBY's fundamentals and its transformation, which is why I expect a reversal of the downward trend as we get closer to that date.

        "166":"$CRSR DD Part 2 or why Corsair will swallow the gaming industry and be a 'millionaire maker' stock Sup apes. In my first [DD last week](https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/nxhh7d\/crsr_dd_or_why_you_should_park_all_your_cash_in\/), I gave a short rundown of why Corsair is incredibly undervalued, and how it should be in **everyone\u2019s portfolio**. With Part 2, I\u2019m addressing a lot of the comments I got as well as going a bit deeper into how Corsair will make this industry their bitch and reach ATH in 2021.  \n\n-\n\n\n**Why is Corsair in a strong position to leverage the gaming and streaming industry?**\n-\nCorsair didn\u2019t snooze, but rather spend the last years hunting for good companies to acquire. Being well funded, profitable and raking in cash every year allowed them to expand in all directions with a core focus on the fastest growing niche: Streaming. Have a look at their investor relations page:\n\n-\n\n*\u201cCorsair is a leading global provider and innovator of high-performance gear for gamers and content creators. Our industry-leading gaming gear helps digital athletes, from casual gamers to committed professionals, to perform at their peak across PC or console platforms, and our streaming gear enables creators to produce studio-quality content to share with friends or to broadcast to millions of fans.* \n\n*CORSAIR also includes subsidiary brands Elgato, which provides premium studio equipment and accessories for content creators, SCUF Gaming, which builds custom-designed controllers for competitive gamers, and **ORIGIN PC**, a builder of custom gaming and workstation desktop PCs and laptops.**\n\n-\nWith Elgato they positioned themselves years ago already to capitalize on one of the fastest growing entertainment subsegments (Streaming). While acquiring SCUF Gaming and ORIGIN PC allowed them to also expand and play in the console market as well as Pre Build PCs and laptops. **They basically moved up the ladder from RGB fans, keyboards, RAM sticks and Cases to EVERYTHING you need to play, stream or game properly.**\n\n**How much faster is Corsair really expanding?**\n-\n\nI cannot stress this enough, but their last quarter results really blew it completely out of the water. Seeing how they raised guidance, I think August will be even more brutal. One for value:\n\n* **$529.4 million** in net revenue, an increase of **71.6%** year-over-year. \n* **$175.9 million** net revenue for Gamer and creator peripherals segment, an increase of **131.9%** year-over-year.\n* Gross profit was **$160.3 million**, an increase of **103.9%** year-over-year, with a gross margin of 30.3%, an improvement of 480 basis points year-over-year. \n* Operating income was **$67.3 million**, an increase of **404.5%** year-over-year.\n* Adjusted operating income was **$80.4 million**, an increase of **221.4%** year-over-year.\n\n\n-\nDo yourself a favor and whip up a site like FinViz, punch in your favorite meme stock and have a look at their revenue number vs market cap. There\u2019s a reason why GME got picked up by DFV. Sales is still king and undervalued companies with aggressive growth have insane potential short and long term.\n\n-\n**Why hasn\u2019t it blown up yet to +100?**\n-\n\nThere is a good amount of chatter about two things. One being market manipulation, the other is that there is very little retail investor interest, compared to the amount of net sellers. The second point actually holds up, the stock never really got picked up by retail investors (or apes) and a lot of the commenters that did buy it up, mentioned how they were perfectly content with amassing shares every month while the price is still low. Pure but selfish value investing. \n\n-\n**Eagle What?**\n-\n\nThis one was also pointed out a lot. Corsair is owned by a private equity firm called EagleTree. They purchased the majority stake back in 2017 (which in turn allowed Corsair to expand much more aggressively) and now is obligated to reduce their share position over the next years until they only hold 10% of the company. \n\nThey currently hold 61.9%. The shares sold are mostly picked up by **Vanguard**, **Blackrock** and a few other small institutions, plus retail of course. Looking at insider transactions we can see that EagleTree usually sells shares twice a year with the last transaction happening **June 3rd 2021**. \n\nThis point doesn\u2019t concern me too much personally, as it\u2019s normal for private equity firms to reduce their stake after IPOs and Corsair is barely dipping $2 even with EagleTree selling 5 million shares. Now having sold their shares just now, it will probably be quiet for the next 6 months. \n\n-\n**Back to 2021 and how you can make money**\n-\n\nThey have a strong customer base which they've built up over the last 20 years, and thought f+ck it, let\u2019s go all in on this market.

I\u2019ll continue buying this company and watching their ER like a hawk while analysts jack themselves off over the sort of numbers Corsair hits out every quarter.**\n\n-\nI said it once, and I\u2019ll say it again. If you don\u2019t hold Corsair shares, you are pretty retarded. But since that\u2019s half the sub already, just do your wife\u2019s boyfriend a favour and pick up some shares while they are still dirt cheap.

Your favourite fruit is back for some sweet DD ($CRSR) that will catapult your shitty portfolio into the stratosphere. \n  \n\n\n  Ever heard of Corsair?\n-\nThey are the boys that fill your neat gaming PC full of dope parts. Not only are they a giant in this industry since their inception in 1994, they also got publicly listed last October for a measly **$15.**\n\n-\n\nNow, why should you care?\n-\n\nCorsair has all the properties that can make it THE stock of the decade for WSB - think AMD before they went from $4 to $80, now this time it's from $30 to $300.\n\n-\n\n**1.DeepF#ckingValue**\n-\n\nTheir current market cap stands at **3.12B** on **1.92B sales** and **148m profit.** That\u2019s insane in itself, their current market cap is minuscule and should be at least 5x their revenue. They are making cash hand over fist every quarter and are already a crazy growth rocket. \n\n\n \n\n-\nAs per recent earnings article: *\u201cMajor industry tailwinds seem to be helping Corsair achieve strong growth rates. In the first quarter, its overall revenue grew 72% year over year to $529 million. The company also continues to see improved profitability, as gross margin jumped from 25.5% a year ago to 30.3%.\u201d*\n\n\n-\n**2.Tiny float**\n-\n\nThey IPO\u2019d with only 91.95 million shares outstanding and a float of 88.4 million. This entire sub could outright buy the company out. Jokes aside, this isn't moving a 500m share giant like NOKIA, but rather like your beer filled kiddiepool.\n**3.Cheap Options**\n-\nFlat movement for the last months meaning LOW IV and CHEAP option prices. $40 Calls on November are $2. And long term leaps at $50 barely cost $1.40. Since inception last year, their shares went from $15 to $54 in the span of a couple months. This rally died off when people finally decided to take profits after the IPO. But if options are too rich for you, it's still an excellent time to buy shares and park your cash there while the run up to $50 happens.\n\n**4.Low Risk** \n-\nAlways arguable, but This company just IPOed, is healthy and makes tons of cash. No risk of bankruptcy looming around the corner, or shares being diluted if it his 50$ or 100$. YOU CAN SAFELY PARK YOUR YOLO'd CASH without the company blowing up any second.\n\n**What else?**\n\nAnalysts on SA have a big raging one for CRSR. (link in comments) and there is a very possible breakout about to happen + earnings coming up in August.\n\n\n\nNow what company fits better for millions of Gamestop apes? A Gaming company that will fill every GameStop with little ram sticks and gaming gear. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n\n\n** TL:DR ** $CRSR is a good bet that could safely triple your money...

        "179":"Short DD on BBBY - huge short interest on an otherwise competitive retail company I'll keep this short: you can read about BBBY's new management, etc elsewhere. This DD covers just 3 points. I've compared BBBY with its main competitors: Target (TGT), Gap (GPS), and Walmart (WMT).\n\n1. Huge short interest as % float. In BBBY, it's 32%. That's a shit-ton of bananas if this thing pops. Keep in mind, that's just the official percentage. We all remember how GME was supposedly not being shorted anymore, right?  \ud83e\udd21  Here is the short as % of float in BBBY's competitors:   \nGAP = 6%  \nTGT = 2%  \nWMT = 1%\n2. Forward-looking P\/E. Now, I know division requires more toes and fingers than you've got (you might have to use your wife's boyfriend's), but take my word for it: forward-looking price\/earnings ratio is a pretty fucking big deal. The lower it is, the more reasonably the stonk is priced. With BBBY, it's 16. With its competitors:  \nGAP = 14  \nTGT = 19  \nWMT = 22\n3. Last but not least, fucking Cramer... I know he's an amoral piece of shit manipulator with access to tens of millions of boomers. I know he tried to fuck us over on GME and other stonks waaaay too many times. But at the same time, he's pumping up BBBY like there's no tomorrow. Did you know that BB spiked up from $8 on zero actual news? The catalyst (that's a thing that makes a rocket go BOOM) was some CNBC guest quickly saying he had some BB calls. The whole thing was just 10 seconds long, but it set off a spike to $10, and the rest was history. If a simple 10-second segment can do that to a grotesquely over-shorted stonk... All I'm saying is that I anticipate a boomer stampede to BBBY sooner rather than later.\n\nAnd that's it - plain and simple. Here, have a banana for making it this far:  \ud83c\udf4c \n\nHell, actually have 10 bananas.  \ud83c\udf4c  \ud83c\udf4c  \ud83c\udf4c  \ud83c\udf4c  \ud83c\udf4c  \ud83c\udf4c  \ud83c\udf4c  \ud83c\udf4c  \ud83c\udf4c  \ud83c\udf4c \n\nFull disclosure: I am an ape. \ud83e\udd8d This is purely for entertainment purposes.

        "180":"A quick DD on CLOV borrowing fee Since I saw a lot of misinformed comments in the daily threads, I figured I would share this information.\n\nThe current borrow fee rate for CLOV is 116.7% (https:\/\/iborrowdesk.com\/report\/clov). The borrow fee rate is not the short interest; that is the number of shares shorted. \n\nThe borrow fee rate is the amount it costs per year to short a share, as shorting requires borrowing. To put it into perspective, for a costant price, a yearly borrow fee rate of 116.7% would imply a daily cost of paying 0.3197% of the value of the shorted share.\n\n0.32% in the world of returns is a lot. \n\nYesterday, the short interest rate on CLOV was 43.54% (https:\/\/twitter.com\/ihors3\/status\/1402368431291314177?s=20). This number might be lower now, as the borrowing fee rate depends on other factors (volatility, ease of locating shares) than just the supply available; shorts may have covered a bit. It will, however, not be a lot lower. What this implies is that for some 30%-50% of the number of shares available on CLOV, the shorts are paying 0.32% of the price of the share just for holding the position, every. single. day. \n\nThe shorts are absolutely bleeding buckets. In fact, this situation, including the drop today, is incredibly similar to GME; I dare say even more so than AMC. Another great buy, support each other please.\n\nI currently hold multiple call options comprising 19% of my portfolio, and that's only because GME takes up 60%.\n\nObligatory rocket emojis \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nEdit: Since I made this thread I received a lot of good, confirming information, which I would like to summarize here:\n\n- The short interest rate is currently at 50.42% according to Ortex.\n\n- https:\/\/fintel.io\/shortSqueeze model states CLOV is currently most likely to squeeze.\n\n- questrade Canada also has a borrow fee of 59%.\n\n- Additionally https:\/\/www.shortsight.com\/ shows that CLOV has a bullish sentiment with a low share availability score of 4, meaning shares are confirmed really limited across the board. This means multiple brokerages are confirmed to have a hard time locating shares. That is huge. Remember what caused GME to not be allowed to be bought anymore? Borrowing fee rates were high for a ton of brokers, and some, including IBKR and Robinhood, had these high borrowing rates in place because they were running out of shares to locate. They could no longer provide the shares they are obligated to provide to those who either want to short or buy the share. And hence they shut both down, as otherwise the brokerages themselves would trigger an insane and instant shortsqueeze. An incredible indicator.\n\nEdit 2: More rocket emojis: \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

Fighting against each other only gives hedges the leg up. The fault is from both sides, no need to create FUD between each other. One common enemy: short sellers. At the end of the day GME, AMC, CLOV have one goal, to trigger short sellers margin. They are heavily leveraged and retail investors are very close to liquidating all their assets.

        "194":"I TRIED TO WARN YOU BUT YOU WOULDN'T LISTEN TO ME!!!!! ASO!!!!!!!!! So......\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI been talking about ASO for a few weeks now.  I started when it was maybe 31.  It's over 37.9 now.  more than 20 percent up since I brought it to your attention.  What I came to understand with all the filtered posts, abuse, riding my ass, and other genreally negative feedback, is that this community has unique standards for what qualifies as a stock worth going in on.  You see, read back to the original GME posts and I was all the same bullshit: \"B&M store\", \"doomed to fail\", \"OK BOOMER\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen GME exploded and it made WallStreetBets famous.  It exposed the corrupt and hateful behavior of hedge funds, and millions of people piled on to WSB in the hopes of catching the next wave.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe problem:  You're all retards.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere have been fundamental changes in the way hedge funds operate now because of us.  Yes WallStreetBets kicked ass and changed the world, but YOU didn't.  YOU might have gotten lucky and hopped on when GME was 17 and rode it to 34, hopped off, hopped back on at 70, hopped off at 80, hopped on at 190, etc etc etc.  You also hopped on and off as it went down. losing money most of the time. Some people made good money, or are the true diamondhands we all wish we are, but the great majority are just plebs giving our money to smarter traders, making small gains here and there, etc.  \n\nAnd the majority of YOU are also now jumping on AMC, BB, etc.  Not having any idea really what is going to happen, making or losing money as the wind blows, thinking you are part of a movement that is leveling the playing field for apes and retards.  So what does someone like YOU do???\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell, I'm here to help! (disclaimer: I'm NOT here to help)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is what you're missing:\n\nThe way GME happened, the way BB and AMC and MVIS and BNGO happened, isn't by your FOMO fool ass jumping in (actually the tail part of it is but we'll get to that later), it happened because DD's occurred with critical analysis of stocks that were undervalued were placed here, and some smart people OTHER than you read it and understood it.  They bought and held for months, bringing up the floor value of the stock long enough that some other reasonably smart but less responsible investors took notice.  Then when they got in the price went up more, until a LOT of people noticed.  A lot of YOU people.  Of course you jumped in with FOMO, but you jumped in as they started selling off.  Then you started posting desperate attempts to get the stock to go up but you have no karma and have nothing meaningful to add so your paosts got filtered and all you could do is post \"me too\" like some brain dead AOL'er on other peoples posts.  \n\nThe era of GME and 80+ percent shorted stocks is gone now.  You changed that.  You didn't profit from it but you got the frenzy going, participated in it, and kicked Melvin's ass.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo what to do now?  Stop chasing! Yes you might win a casino bet concerning AMC now but ultimately (and AMC agrees), the stock is way over valued now and most of you are going to lose money.  Also, like all casino bets, ultimately the casino wins.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEvery once in a while a stock comes up here that is undervalued and has enough short interest, etc, that you might get a nice gamma squeeze out of it.  I think the best bet is to look at those, CRITICALLY, and decide if it's worth throwing in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTHEN WAIT.\n\nIf the stock is actually undervalued (like BB, AMC, GME were originally), you might get a nice pop, an incredible pop even.  But patience is key, and even if you don't get a pop the stock will still do well.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo what does this have to do with ASO?  Well its undervalued, fairly shorted, mostly institutionally owned, and waiting to get noticed.  Should you buy?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWELL  IT'S TOO LATE!!!!!!!!  \n\nTHE STOCK ANNOUNCES EARNINGS TOMORROW MORNING YOU IDIOT!!! TOO LATE TO BUY CALLS.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI WARNED YOU BUT YOU DIDN'T LISTEN TO ME.  WATCH THE TICKER TOMORROW MORNING AND WATCH OTHER PEOPLE WIN AGAIN!!!!!!!!\n\n\n\nfor entertainment purposes only.",

You want to do something with BB, just like GME and AMC?

You can also think of this post as a Part 2 to [my previous post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/CLOV\/comments\/ngesez\/this_is_the_bottom_and_youll_be_top_of_the_world\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). Brief description of my last post - it was about the stock reaching its bottom at $6.80 and only going up from there (which was correct).\n\n**TL;DR - Currently, the highest number of options purchased have a strike price between $7-18 for every single month. The goal is to stay above $12 to create a snowball of options being executed, thereby causing a gamma squeeze - the higher the strike price, the higher the limit to execute and the hedges are worse off.**\n\n**What Is Clover Health?**\n\nClover Health is not just another insurance company. They have combined Medicare insurance services with new patient-centered technology aimed at facilitating the ease and effectiveness of diagnosis, treatment, and most importantly, prevention. This company should not be classified as a health insurance company, but a tech company. Their AI learning and database, Clover Assistant, make it easier for providers to eliminate unnecessary and repetitive lab testing, repetitive diagnoses, and it consolidates a patient\u2019s medical history into one platform. This not only saves the patient headaches from navigating our decentralized healthcare system, but it also saves both patients and insurance companies an enormous amount of money by avoiding duplicated efforts. \n\nCurrently, CLOV covers 66,300 customers across 8 states out of the 61,212,247 Medicare beneficiaries nationwide, which equates to .0011% of the beneficiary population. As you can tell, this number is extremely low, which makes sense since they are a brand new company. When they reach even 1% of the beneficiaries, this company\u2019s stock price would be $100+ based on fundamentals alone. But I expect these numbers to skyrocket as they gain more members and their AI learning database improves more and more.\n\n[CLOV Medicare Advantage Plan by &#37; of growth compared to competitors \\(cloverhealth.com\\)](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/wuoalim07q371.png?width=3297&format=png&auto=webp&s=b38cba4adeb4fcbbeae5d53ea93751964480113a)\n\nCLOV has huge long-term growth potential, so the risk to reward is extremely favorable towards getting into the squeeze. Let me explain why.\n\n**Positive Catalysts**\n\nAll the negative catalysts are out of the way and everything is priced in. Here are some positives I\u2019m keeping an eye on: \n\n* DOJ\/SEC case dropping or settling (even if CLOV is found guilty of taking advantage of Medicare, it will still be positive because at max they\u2019ll pay a fine and that\u2019ll be over with). I highly doubt CLOV will be found guilty though because the Hindenburg claims are rather baseless and the DOJ were forced to inquire about this only because it\u2019s related to Medicare. \n* Biden\u2019s health care proposal reducing the Medicare qualifying age below 65 would create millions of new beneficiaries. The hype around the proposal alone will create a huge stock price increase in all healthcare-related stocks, so CLOV will definitely benefit.\n* CLOV is officially added to the Russell 3000, who will have to purchase a ton of CLOV shares.\n* PR of any new partnership, expanding to further states, and increasing current partnerships. They\u2019re growing rapidly as is, so news like this is bound to come out in the near future.\n\n**The Dark Clouds Surrounding CLOV**\n\n* As previously mentioned, the DOJ inquiry is still lingering and it\u2019s unclear when it will be settled. Although it\u2019s priced in, it is still something to watch out for.\n* Hindenturd\u2019s constant attacks despite insisting they don\u2019t have any positions. Why would Hindenburg attack Chamath Palihapitiya even though they aren\u2019t benefiting from it, according to themselves? This relates to the GME\/AMC squeeze; Chamath was a big proponent of the push against the hedges. He was outspoken about the squeeze on several occasions and gave GME his validation, which in turn hurt Citadel and other hedges shorting GME immensely. Hindenburg\u2019s report was created to hurt all of Chamath\u2019s IPOs, especially CLOV. Basically, this is retaliation against Chamath for standing with the retail investors, and if I had to take a wild guess, Citadel has paid Hindenburg to write this baseless report. I\u2019ve added a link at the bottom of this post about the Hindenburg allegations and the counter from CLOV for those who were not aware of all the allegations. (PS - Despite all the negative press surrounding Chamath, his track record is stellar.)\n* The constant manipulation by short sellers to create negative incentive. For instance, the fake lawsuits by Lifshitz that are shady at best; if you go to their website, you\u2019ll find the phone number listed goes straight to voicemail. All their social media lead to Wix.com platforms instead of their own. And, **THEIR PHYSICAL LOCATION DOES NOT EXIST** as shown in Google Maps. Lots of red flags.\n\n**Let\u2019s get down to the nitty gritty - The Daddy of all Short Squeezes**\n\nCLOV is currently over 42.58% as of Friday, making it the highest shorted stock on paper (and it\u2019s unclear how many naked shorts there are, which could easily be 70-100%+; it\u2019s impossible to know since those shares are shorted illegally). THE SQUEEZE IS INEVITABLE, it\u2019s just a matter of how much more the short interest increases, which will correlate to a bigger squeeze. Furthermore, the borrowed interest on CLOV stock has more than doubled to 3.7%, meaning those who are shorting have to pay much higher interest on borrowing the stocks, and that number will only continue to increase as demand increases. Soon, they won\u2019t be able to borrow anymore stocks and will have to short it naked in order to suppress the price further, essentially digging a gargantuan hole in which to bury themselves.\n\n[CLOV S\\\/I&#37; as reported by Ortex](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/yem0laz57q371.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d0602994d6bc0ddc1305c2737a8b1d70de3f7c58)\n\nNo need to fear the company dumping their shares or diluting it because the Class B shares are locked up - the directors aren\u2019t able to sell any shares until the stock price stays above $30 for 90 consecutive days or more. The company is $700 million cash flow positive and no debt, therefore there won\u2019t be any dilution.\n\nThe P\/S ratio is considered a particularly good metric for evaluating young, potentially high growth companies or companies in cyclical industries that may not show an actual net profit every year. Let\u2019s talk about CLOV\u2019s P\/S ratio for a moment. \n\nCLOV\u2019s 2020 revenue was $672.9 million compared to $462.3 million in 2019, which puts it at 45.6% increase in growth. They beat their own expectations and those of analysts by a wide margin. In 2018 and 2019, the market valued tech companies with IPOs at an average of 11.7 and 10.4 times (respectively) their previous 12 month earnings. Conservatively, that would put CLOV at $7 billion market cap, which is around $20+ fair value. But in 2020, that number doubled, which would increase CLOV\u2019s market cap significantly. However, for this consideration, I\u2019m using the 2018\/19 valuation to be conservative.\n\n**Bottom Line**\n\nThe fair value of CLOV is anywhere from $20-30 fundamentally, which makes it a very risk-free, undervalued stock that has been suppressed by short sellers. But this post is not about the fundamentals - this is about exposing the short sellers\u2019 manipulation of CLOV. On paper, this company is shorted 42.58% (though this is MUCH higher when you include the illegal naked shorts that aren\u2019t reported), making it the highest shorted stock as of Friday. This number could go much higher as short sellers continue to borrow stocks and suppress the price further, which only hurts them more the longer this is shorted. As is common knowledge from previous squeezes, hedge funds are not going to cover anytime soon; they have to be forced by triggering their margins. As the Fed hinted recently, hedge funds are the most leveraged they\u2019ve ever been in the last 20 years, which means retail investors can take advantage of them just like they\u2019ve been taking advantage of retail investors for 100s of years.\n\nI don\u2019t know how much it could squeeze, from $50-150 or much higher, and there\u2019s no telling where the ceiling will end up. The squeeze is inevitable, whether you or I buy it or not, but the process of how long it will take is up to the retail investing community.\n\nCLOV\u2019s Response to Hindenburg Allegations: [https:\/\/www.streetinsider.com\/Corporate+News\/Clover+Health+Investments+%28CLOV%29+Issues+Response+to+Short+Seller+Hindenburg+Research\/17921324.html](https:\/\/www.streetinsider.com\/Corporate+News\/Clover+Health+Investments+%28CLOV%29+Issues+Response+to+Short+Seller+Hindenburg+Research\/17921324.html)",

        "213":"Made another WSB sentiment analyzing bot (I used machine learning) -- 33% annual return ($16k). Source code and explanation below! So a few days ago someone made a sentiment analyzing bot for this sub and as a programmer myself, I thought I\u2019d try my hand! For those of you that want to poke around or use this for yourself, \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: here\u2019s my [source code](https:\/\/github.com\/tstewart161\/Reddit_Sentiment_Trader)\n\nEdit: [Hosted version](https:\/\/getquantbase.com\/) (how to actually run\/invest in it). Folks the amount of y\u2019all that have messaged me asking for this is absolutely AMAZING but I can\u2019t keep up! Posting the link here for you guys\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**HOW I DID THIS:** Scraped WSB sentiment, got the top + most positively mentioned stocks on WSB (for the better part of this year, that's been $GME and $AMC, recently some $SPCE and $NVDA, and about 6 other stocks -- I could do more but the relevance drops off typically after this. I have the strategy rebalancing monthly. The source code is actually pretty intuitive for a beginner\/intermediate programmer, but essentially what it uses is VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning), which is a model used for text sentiment analysis that is sensitive to both polarity (positive\/negative) and intensity (strength) of emotion.\n\n**HOW THIS WORKS:** The way it works is by relying on a dictionary that maps lexical (aka word-based) features to emotion intensities -- these are known as sentiment scores. The overall sentiment score of a comment\/post is achieved by summing up the intensity of each word in the text.\n\nIn some ways, it's easy: words like \u2018love\u2019, \u2018enjoy\u2019, \u2018happy\u2019, \u2018like\u2019 all convey a positive sentiment. Also VADER is smart enough to understand the basic context of these words, such as \u201cdid not love\u201d as a negative statement. It also understands the emphasis of capitalization and punctuation, such as \u201cENJOY\u201d which is pretty cool. Phrases like \u201cThe acting was good , but the movie could have been better\u201d have sentiments in both polarities, which makes this kind of analysis tricky -- essentially w VADER you would analyze which part of the sentiment here is more intense.\n\n**Results and some stats:** Right now I'm up 60% YTD, compared to the SP500's 13% (the recent spikes in GME and AMC have helped tremendously)\n\n\\- The strategy is backtested only to the beginning of 2020, but I'm working on it. It's got an annualized return of 33% (compared to 16% for the SP500)\n\n\\- Max drawdown of -8.7% (aka how far it went down before coming back up -- interestingly enough, WallStreetBets weathered COVID pretty well)\n\nHappy to answer any more questions about the process\/results. I think doing stuff like this is pretty cool as someone with a foot in algo trading and traditional financial markets",

After multiple valuation rounds, it opened at $102.00, from which it rallied up to north of $180 on opening day. With an ATH within recent months up to $250+, the stock became fatter than a swamp possum with the mumps, bleeding down until $110, new low since IPO. Today, it rallied to $140. Here's a quick rundown of DASH history, followed by why this garbage ass stock will drown faster than Bill Gates in a sea of pussy upon the closing out of his recent marital transactions. \n\nDec 9 2020 - Doordash ($DASH), food delivery services company with larger market share than competitors (UBER, GRUB etc.) IPO's and opens on secondary market (us retards buying micro-cap growth stocks with revenue projections more bullishIT than me losing my virginity to Ariana Grande and paying for Robinhood's order flow while doing it) at $180 USD.\n\nJan 2021 - Stock hits new low of $140, well, cuz it's dogshit and wsb bought calls (not true). Meanwhile, your wife's boyfriend shorted it (true) and made enough money to plant hairs on Cramer's head.\n\nFebruary - New ATH after GME saga at ~$250. This is when Warren Buffet opened his secret position of $DASH puts.

That means less dashers and more people actually living life in the summer in the U S of A first time since the pandemic. \n\n- Had a breakout year where revenues more than 3x'd and still didn't make any money like GME bag holders, same with yesterday's earnings report for Q1 - still didn't make any freaking profits.\n\n- Ongoing upheaval with legislative forces regarding the classification of its' employees as actual employees instead of \"gig workers\" who take it up the ass with no benefits and stability.

        "223":"Investing 101: For WSB fresh meat Hello  WSB, You might recognize me as the author of that shitty GME DD (that was taken down for \"hate violations\" rip old wsb) that never came true. Actually, I think there still may be truth to the post. Maybe HF's are hiding SI, maybe my initial date was off and we are still prime for a squeeze soon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut this post is not about gamestop. I am writing this post to answer a question that melvins bot asked me: How the actual fuck do you make money trading options and you don't know what \"writing a put\" means?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell I do know what writing a put means, but I believe the newbies of WSB would like to hear my answer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow do you make money in the stock market if you aren't a financial professional? The answer is simple: The Long\/Short Portfolio\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat is Long\/Short? The premise of a long\/short portfolio is to be prepared for anything that could happen in the market. Even the best traders in the world can't guess and time every single economic event. The goal of the long\/short is to have a portfolio set up that can make money in any market. The most basic long\/short combination is SPY\/VIX. If you compare the charts, they are pretty much exact inverses of each other. Because of this, you can protect yourself against a market crash.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo give an example of how I use the SPY\/VIX, I had spy investments that were up 25% around the 13th of april. My belief is that gamestop will squeeze soon, and when it does, the rest of the market will sell off. To act on this belief, I pulled most of my gains out of the spy and slightly increased my position in the VIX. This \"reaction\" can be triggered by your personal beliefs in the market, gamestop was just an example. If you only purchase the vix when it is near an all time low, and never purchase the spy at an all time high, you will have a foolproof hedge\\* Not to mention, the vix does not just pop on devastating market events. Normal corrections can be profited from through the vix. As you can see, this set up is made for protection. For example, if you were invested in the VIX and S&P before the covid crash, your vix investment would have increased just as much as your spy decreased. If you sold your vix, and waited a year, your spy would be back to it's previous value, and you would pocket the profit from the vix.\n\n\\*Foolproof as in one investment will hedge the other. A 50\/50 vix spy split will not be profitable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are many ways to set up a long\/short portfolio. SPY\/VIX is the simplest, and probably the least profitable because it is created for this very reason. Perhaps an investor could find cyclical stocks that benefit from the others loss, and use that as a long\/short. It's also possible to find cyclical stocks that are at a very low price, and hedge with more mainstream investments\/tools, just like a certain DFV. It's ok to gamble on meme stocks as long as your portfolio has a long\/short backbone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll in all, it is not possible to guess everything that will happen. So how do good traders make money even if they don't understand the exact intricacies and implications of options, or even economic functions in general? Long\/short. They don't know everything. They just use the tools available to them to be prepared for everything.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOk cool lots of talk about strategy but this is WSB and you're here for options. So how do you use long\/short with options? Invest the exact same way a boomer would, but with leaps. What is the difference between parking your spare cash in S&P shares vs S&P leap calls for 2 years? If you are an active investor, there is no difference in risk. I would\n\nargue that through periodic vix investments, it is even less risky then letting your cash sit in shares. The benefit is that the return of the leap S&P options will return much more profit then the shares.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDisclaimer: I'm not responsible for any money you lose. And please, if you don't know options, research a lot before playing with them. From personal experience, it is very very easy to lose money. If you want to practice the long\/short, use SPY\/VIXY shares for a safer start. If you are new to investing in general, paper trade first.  This is my own approach to the market. I am sharing it because I got my start in the market through WSB. This sub has cycles. It's normal for awhile, then a post hits the front page and there's a huge influx of noobs. Eventually, the words of the OGs get through to the noobs, and they learn the game. I think this new cycle has brought more newbies then the OGs can keep up with. So here's my advice, take it or leave it\n\nEdit:   I am not a professional ",

        "230":"WEBULL to FIDELITY Transfer...PLEASE READ IF YOU ARE ON WEBULL AND CONSIDERING TRANSFERRING **PLEASE READ IF YOU ARE ON WEBULL AND CONSIDERING TRANSFERRING**\n\nI finally transferred my GME shares in Webull into Fidelity...but I thought i'd make this post to shed some light on the \"partial transfer\" vs \"full transfer\"\n\nI've have to do both since my partial transfer never went through...\n\n**PARTIAL TRANSFER**\n\n\\- This will require a settled cash balance of $75 in your WEBULL account prior to the transfer being completed...\n\n\\- My partial transfer request was never completed and just on hold with no updates to the status on Fidelity's transfer tracker since 04\/24 until I called Fidelity to find out that Webull had rejected the transfer...couldn't get Webull on the line to ask them why...\n\n\\- However, i decided to just initiate a full transfer after my friend was able to successfully transfer his shares over (read on)\n\n**FULL TRANSFER**\n\n\\- Followed my friend's advice who did a full transfer of his account into Fidelity and I'm glad I did this.\n\n\\- I initiated the full transfer on 04\/30 and was completed yesterday (so it will take about **3-4 days** for a full transfer, much quicker than the 1-2 weeks that they give as the amount of time they allow to process). (my estimated date of completion was 05\/13 but it completed yesterday 05\/05 and shares were available in my Fidelity account when I checked this morning 05\/06).\n\n\\- In initiating a full transfer, it seems Fidelity actually paid that $75 transfer fee because **there was a $75 cash debit balance** that was transferred into my Fidelity account **along with my GME shares**.\n\n\\- And now i just had to deposit $75 into my fidelity account (which they're much quicker about) to maintain my account balance without any negative cash debits.\n\n\\- This route was FAR EASIER than having to go about the deposit $75 into Webull, wait for it to clear and then settle, then partial transfer, and wait for the partial transfer to complete...\n\nI think this is a GOOD OPTION for ***those who do NOT already have a $75 settled cash balance in their Webull accounts***...like me, i didn't have $75 in settled cash and to ACH deposit, wait for it to clear, and then wait for it to settle in my Webull account would take about 7-10 days...plus the time it takes to complete the partial transfer from Webull into fidelity......I suggest instead of going through that hassle, to initiate a full transfer as it will only take about 3-4 days (took my friend 3, took me 4 but this could have been due to me initiating the transfer on a Friday evening).\n\n\\- However, if you DO have a $75 settled cash balance in your Webull account, then based on previous posts, my suggestion would be to just initiate a partial transfer through Fidelity as there would be no reason for the transfer request to be held up from Webull's end. This partial transfer, based on previous posts, seems to be completing in \\~2 days as opposed to the full transfer's duration of \\~3-4 days.\n\nJust wanted to shed some light on this as I know there are many apes who are reluctant to transfer their shares into a broker with the assets to back up their positions...but if you're hesitating from transferring from Webull due to the $75 transfer fee etc, then I think this post should help you in getting your GME shares over to Fidelity ASAP based on your individual situation.\n\nEdit: Not financial advice.

        "236":"CLOV volume price analysis   \n\nHi fellow traders, this is my first time posting on WSB and wanted to share with you some TA using volume price analysis on CLOV. I got interested in CLOV recently and having profited a lot on GME (bought in shares and options in November). I felt this was my next big bet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/2sx4id9ldlw61.png?width=713&format=png&auto=webp&s=4fabd25308652e8c12e834d7e4f17b77e160b430\n\nFirst of all on the weekly chart, I see signs of the market maker buying during the bear market in this stock that lasted from January to March. At #1, we have a hammer candle with a deep lower wick on very high volume which signals that the market maker is trying to stop the downfall and failed. The stock pursued its fall and reached the buying climax by the market maker in March. I can see this with the high volume and deep lower wick. Having retraced a significant amount since its ATH, the market needed to test this level to see if all the sellers were out of the market. The $7 retest was successful on low volume as we can see with the small doji that printed on the chart in april. The retest was above the ATL signaling strength. The next 4 candles have higher highs, higher lows and very very high volume. The long upper wicks signal that insiders are trying to push the price down but are incapable of breaking the trend because the buying pressure is intense.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/w4oo9rdmdlw61.png?width=713&format=png&auto=webp&s=11d7e1ed18232b575526ec194f840d47fddaa3f4\n\nOn the daily chart, we see the buying climax with the white hammer having a deep lower wick that coincided with the general market bottoming out in March. #2 was an attempt to breakout on high volume but was unsuccessful; the market retreated on falling volume, which is bullish. #3 is a very interesting candle: the stock tried to breakout again but was pushed violently to the downside below $9 on insane volume. Insiders were very desperate to push this stock down. #4 was the breakout on again very high volume. Insiders were trying to push the stock down again but failed! The following candles saw a test of the commitment of the sellers (test of supply) and there was none! Instead, we saw the stock trending lower of declining volume, which is very bullish (this is where I pulled the trigger and got a fill at $9.42 once the stock started climbing again). It didn\u2019t take long for the stock to rise again on high volume, only to be suppressed once again. The battle isn\u2019t over with the bears, but the signals that the bulls are starting to take over are there when you look at price and volume. At the second to last candle we see a bearish candle called the dark cloud cover: it signals a short term downtrend. As we see with the last candle (inverted hammer), the volume is declining once again as sellers are not in the market. This could signal the end of this short-term downtrend, but we need more price action to confirm this. There is a case for a short squeeze in this stock, though I don\u2019t believe it will squeeze like GME since the percentage of the float shorted is nowhere near what GME was. Clearing the $14 mark on high volume is very important to see this stock soar to the ATH of $17.50 and beyond. The last candles on the chart signal a bumpy ride ahead; the bears will not give up easily but when they do, this bet will be a very rewarding one.\n\nP.S.: Don\u2019t take my word for it and do your own DD.\n\nCLOV 15$C 06\/18 + 550 shares.",

        "243":"CLOV DD - No Bullshit CLOV has a very interesting setup right now but way too many people seem to only care about the short float debate that has been unfolding over the last few days. To sum that up: FactSet (top financial data provider) had the CLOV float listed as 23.5M and short interest at 39M - putting the percentage of the float shorted at 146.6%. This circulated online and has been argued on twitter and reddit starting Friday. Factset has since updated the float to 109.8M making the 39M short interest account for 36% of the float. They previously had deducted the CEO\u2019s class B shares from the total class A shares, and although his shares are \u201cnon-tradeable\u201d and shouldn't be included in the public float, they were only using the class A shares to determine the float as all class B shares are already non-tradeable unless converted - so shouldn\u2019t have been part of the equation to begin with. Now I could get more into the \"Hindenberg said this\u201d and \u201cS3 said this\u201d bullshit that people have been arguing about...\n\nBut heres why NONE OF THAT EVEN FUCKING MATTERS\n\nShorts and those who have been bashing CLOV and arguing against the original short float number are taking a victory lap, like Factset updating the short float to 36% destroys the entire bullish case for CLOV and now it will tank. BULLSHIT, here\u2019s why:\n\nThe 39M short interest number being used in the short float calculation is from 3\/31. Over two weeks ago. When the two highest volume and highest short volume days in CLOV history have occurred within the last two weeks. With \\~30M short volume on 4\/8 and \\~90M short volume on Friday (according to Fintel). We don\u2019t know at this time how much of the short volume is covered and would be included in the current short interest; but given all this, you could logically conclude the short float on CLOV right now could be pretty damn high. For context, 36% short float - based on outdated short interest from 3\/31 - is in the ballpark of double what we're currently seeing in GME or AMC, and would still make CLOV one of the highest short float stocks in the entire market right now.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/rvr4bslwszt61.png?width=1242&format=png&auto=webp&s=801f7c4f339e3573272d280586c7a9bd54d8343d\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/l4ssab8yszt61.png?width=2010&format=png&auto=webp&s=10de1da2465f375d84f5d28bdf9689936cf5af48\n\nThe short float is only a small piece of the puzzle, and it\u2019s without a doubt high enough to trigger a short squeeze if price continues to rise, end of story. Now let\u2019s get into the shit that really matters.\n\nFirst off, from a technical perspective, there are some good signs.

This is where I should break down the mechanics of a gamma squeeze, but really all you need to know is that heavy call volume is important for two reasons: 1) it can be a good indicator of where money is flowing in the market and 2) the people who write the call options need to buy shares to hedge against their position. The more the price rises the more shares they need to buy, helping to push price higher just like we see in a short squeeze.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNext, CLOV is down over 50% from Dec\/Jan highs. Some of the main reasons for the drop would be:\n\n* Money flowing out of growth stocks and SPACS\n* Hindenberg short report\n* Short seller price manipulation\n\nThe Hindenburg short attack really did a number on CLOV. The stock was trading at about $14 prior to the release of their short report and dropped over 50% in the weeks following its release.\n\nHindenburg attacked CLOV from many different angles. One of their main arguments being that Clover Health uses misleading and unethical marketing practices to boost sales, as evidence stating that in 2016: \u201cClover was fined for misleading marketing practices by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)\u201d\n\nWell, just this month (April 8th), the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services granted Clover heath approval in 10 new states. CLOV has yet to release a PR on this but it has been updated on the CMS website (see picture below). The stock price jumped with huge volume on this news but short sellers were able to manipulate it back down until the spike we just saw on Friday.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/sc2w81eatzt61.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=7eb791918794ff6a425e42fffa397e409788b782\n\nIt seems that Hindenbergs argument doesn\u2019t hold up as the same federal agency (CMS) they were using to support claims against Clover Health is currently supporting Clovers expansion into 10 new states. Which is huge news for CLOV by the way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Wrapping this up**\n\nNow say what you will about Chamath, but he had retail investors back during the GME squeeze. He promoted it, posted his personal positions, and while Wall Street, CNBC, and others attacked Gamestop, Chamath defended retail traders and the movement as a whole. It may be a total coincidence that his SPAC\u2019s were the target of short attacks shortly after, but his support of the GME squeeze may have made him a bigger target.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo one knows what will happen in the market, I sure as hell don\u2019t, but given all that's been laid out here, I like the stock.\n\n$CLOV to $30\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso: this is not financial advice, do your own DD blah blah blah\n\nAnd for those asking about my position.

        "250":"Tried to post ASO DD this weekend but it got autofiltered. So, here it is if you are still interested! By now you have likely seen some $ASO talk. There are some other really good DD posts in WSB that cover different aspects of the stock. This post will break down why I'm bullish AF on ASO and why I believe that it could hit $60 or higher in the next few weeks. Before GME gang jumps down my throat, don't worry, I am still hodling. There are other stocks to make money on while that one consolidates and trades sideways for a little while. \n \n&nbsp;\n\n**TL;DR**: ASO looks a lot like RKT did in February when there was a massive spike. Short interest is high (may be over 45%) on a stock that has been steadily rising since its IPO in late 2020. They beat earnings expectations in a similar fashion to RKT (1.09 actual vs. 0.62 expected EPS = 76% beat). Undervalued stock that is primed for a squeeze means bears r fuk. \n \n&nbsp;\n  \nOk, for those of you apes with a few wrinkles, I will explain why you might be able to take your wife and her boyfriend and her parents to Red Lobster and order more than water and biscuits. \n \n&nbsp;\n \n**2021 is the year of the squeezes and the SI% on this bad boy is HIGH**\n \n&nbsp;\n \nHedgies have shorted a wide swath of the market, with a focus on retailers. Makes sense, right? The pandemic has hit a lot of retailers hard, forcing a lot of store closures. Academy Sports & Outdoors has been able to thrive through the pandemic for a few reasons: \n \n1. Their stores are mainly located in southern states whose COVID restrictions are far more lax than their northern counterparts. \n  \n2. Guns and ammo. There has been a massive pullback on offering guns and ammo by big box retailers due to a shift in public sentiment due to mass shootings. However, thanks to the pandemic and civil unrest, more people are buying guns than ever. ASO has not curtailed their gun and ammo offerings, which are a recession-proof sales channel right next to liquor.  \n \n&nbsp;\n\n \nRetailers have been shorted massively (see GME) with the shorts expecting that retail will die with the rise of online sales. Maybe they are right in the long term, but for now, people are still going to stores. Here in GA, you wouldn't know there is a pandemic if people weren't wearing masks. The mall parking lots are full. The short interest on ASO was 45.21% on 3\/15 according to TD Ameritrade (compare that to 36.6% on RKT in late February). The stock is up 147% since its IPO in October 2020 without any significant dips, which tells us one thing: none of the shorts are in the money.  I first took interest in ASO about a month ago when I saw them at the top of the shorted list. Investing in stocks in January that had high short interest was quite lucrative for me, so I've been trying to continue investing in shorted stocks that appear to have a bright future. Because bears r fuk and squeezes are fun. \n   \n&nbsp;\n\nLet's look at the short interest over time for ASO: \n \n&nbsp;\n\n|Report Date|Total Shares Sold Short|Dollar Volume Sold Short|Change from Previous Report|Percentage of Float Shorted|Days to Cover|Price on Report Date|\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n|3\/15\/2021|12,510,000 shares|$308.37 million|+0.8%|39.4%|9.1|$24.65|\n|2\/26\/2021|12,410,000 shares|$305.04 million|-3.0%|39.1%|8.3|$24.58|\n|2\/12\/2021|12,790,000 shares|$306.45 million|+24.5%|41.2%|8.9|$23.96|\n|1\/29\/2021|10,270,000 shares|$262.50 million|+10.1%|33.1%|7.3|$25.56|\n|1\/15\/2021|9,330,000 shares|$196.58 million|No Change|44.8%|8.4|$21.07|\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWe can see that short interest has increased over time up to a high here of 39.4% on 3\/15. TD Ameritrade says 45.21% and we know that short interest is not clear cut, so there is some variance on that  SI%. \n \n&nbsp;\n\nMost shares were shorted between $21 - $25 and were still shorted on 3\/15. What has happened to the price since 3\/15? It was driven down to a low of $23.19. As seen on [this chart](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/yrwzR6R.jpg). This means that most of the shorts did not become profitable during the biggest drop since the latest SI% report and likely did not cover. There was another seemingly artificial drop on 3\/31 down to $24.50 where some shorts may have covered which [I have put a little box around](https:\/\/imgur.com\/lss7ppj). Why do I say that it is an artificial drop? Because the company absolutely crushed earnings expectations and was trending up the day earnings were released. That premarket drop was clearly induced and may have been an opportunity for some of the shorts to cover with a small profit, but certainly not the majority. I believe SI% is still very high and there is a **squeeze to be squoze**. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nSome may attribute the drop in price on 3\/31 to the **IPO lockup expiration**. If you don't know what lockup expiration means, \n&nbsp;\n\n\n>When a company goes public through a traditional IPO, it usually sets a lock-up period of 90 to 180 days during which insiders can't sell their shares. That rule isn't mandated by the Securities and Exchange Commission -- it's a self-imposed one that prevents big investors from flooding the market with shares.\n&nbsp;\n\n\nSo, the lockup  expired and insiders can sell their shares, but why would they? They just beat earnings by a lot and should expect their shares to continue to increase in value. Also, there were further restrictions placed on insider sales that a commenter on another ASO DD thread made. I'm assuming it was valid research. Hopefully they can add it to this post because I don't have the full details, but essentially there is a still limit on how much the insiders can sell at one time as to no shift the price too much and that limit is 1% of the company's value. With a $2.64B market cap right now, that is $26.4M, or about 900,000 shares being the limit on insider sales in a day.  It is entirely possible that the lockup expiry was the cause of the 3\/31 drop, which would mean that it was not artificial and it was not a plan by shorts to cover. Meaning SI% is still in the 35-45% range. \n\n&nbsp;\n \n**THE STOCK IS UNDERVALUED**\n\n&nbsp;\n \n[According to Yahoo Finance](https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/results-academy-sports-outdoors-inc-052048433.html) the consensus price target is $32. [Simply Wall St](https:\/\/imgur.com\/Y95DfqK) has a fair value estimate of $49.99. Prior to the company beating EPS expectations by 76%, I was seeing discounted cash flow values of $35\/share. [GuruFocus has DCF value at $36.29](https:\/\/www.gurufocus.com\/stock\/ASO\/dcf). The price has been depressed. Watching the charts for the last month, there have been pretty massive sell walls in the $25 - $29 range, with order books full of those suspicious algorithm share #'s keeping the price from going up to its fair value naturally. With price targets that have not been fully updated for the earnings beat and increasing volume being between $28 - $35, it seems that the worst case scenario is buying in at $30 will net about a 10% gain or loss. That is attractive to boomers, which could increase retail volume.  \n \n&nbsp;\n\nDid someone say **volume**? Average volume was around 1.5M. Since earnings were released there has been an increase in volume: \n \n&nbsp;\n\n|Date|Volume|Over\/(Under) Average|\n--:|:--|:--|\n|26-Mar| 775,000| (725,000)|\n|29-Mar| 2,390,000| 890,000|\n|Earnings Release 30-Mar| 4,880,000| 3,380,000|\n|Lockup Expiry 31-Mar| 5,040,000| 3,540,000|\n|1-Apr| 3,610,000| 2,110,000|\n\n&nbsp;\n \nPrice at open on the day of earnings release was $24.98. It closed on 4\/1 at $29.01 for a 16% increase and kept going up after hours another $1 or another 4%. \n \n&nbsp;\n\nLet's see that in a table: \n\n|Date|Open|Close|% Change since earnings||\n:--|--:|--:|--:|:--|\n|26-Mar|23.92|24.59|||\n|29-Mar|24.98|24.23|-3.0%||\n|30-Mar|24.59|26.74|7.0%||\n|31-Mar|25.79|27.05|8.3%||\n|1-Apr|27.08|29.01|16.1%||\n|After Hours|29.01|30.00|20.1%||\n\n&nbsp;\n \nNow, I said previously that this stock reminds me of RKT. Strong earnings release for a heavily shorted stock and a delayed increase in price due to massive resistance. That resistance was overcome for RKT from massive buying volume as retail jumped on board. Volume really picked up and the RKT flew. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n \n|Date|Open|Close|% Change since earnings|\n--:|--:|--:|--:|\n|25-Feb|20.33|19.9|-2.1%|\n|26-Feb|23.33|21.85|7.5%|\n|1-Mar|23|24.3|19.5%|\n|2-Mar|27.34|41.6|104.6%|\n \n&nbsp;\n \nI'm not saying that ASO will have a 100% gain this week, but if you look at what's been happening in 2021 (RKT, AMC, Discovery?), when a stock gets attention and momentum with a high SI%, it is entirely possible to jump 100% in a day. ASO seems similar to RKT in terms of having low float, high short interest, consistently beating earnings, and absolute price. The price point is really important here. Most jabronis can afford to buy into a $30 stock. \n  \n&nbsp;\n\n**Indicators** \n \nI don't put a ton of faith in traditional indicators because we live in the Upside Down now, but MACD and RSI both look very promising, with MACD [on the 3-month chart](https:\/\/imgur.com\/unGgIgg) \"crossing over\" into positive territory on 3\/30. This is a bullish sign for the chart watchers. RSI on the daily, weekly, and monthly charts is over 70. Also a bullish indicator (to me). \n\n&nbsp;\n \n**Conclusion** \n&nbsp;\n\nFor me, personally, I think ASO is primed to have a big day this week if it volume gets high enough. By big day I mean spiking to anywhere from $45 - $60 before settling back into $35 - $40 and then slowly growing. If it goes any higher than $60 I will definitely be throwing a pizza party for my local store. \n \n&nbsp;\n \n\nThanks for reading my post. Good luck out there. [Enjoy this video of my dog eating a banana](https:\/\/v.redd.it\/p23legq9zuo61\/DASH_96.mp4). Dogs are apes too.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nPositions = 223 shares. [38 calls at various strikes expirations](https:\/\/imgur.com\/nC2pwHm). I sold 5 calls on Friday just to know what it feels like to close a position with a gain.\n \n&nbsp;\n\nEdit: Guess I'll update this since this post was written on Saturday. Looks like initial predictions were right. The stock has gone up. Calls are printing. Still think that the steady gains could attract enough volume that it could trigger a spike. Gamma or short squeeze, take your pick. We are very close to $35 at the time of this post, where there are a lot of calls held that could trigger a Gamma squeeze up to $45 now since they released new $45 calls last night. This stock keeps \"gapping up\", which makes me think that we aren't seeing the actual buy volume during market hours. It was the #3 stock talked about in the weekend threads and we aren't seeing the volume to match. My theory on that is that people are buying on RH and WB and other brokerages that don't settle buys until after hours. Hoping to gap up again to $35 Wednesday morning and then it should get really fun. Interestingly, there were $621k in $35 puts purchased between 10:00am and 10:05EST today, 4\/6. Maybe a way to depress the price further. Looks like this stock is another battleground between shorts and bulls with massive balls with kangaroos just dancing around enjoying their bouncing.\n\n \n&nbsp;\n\nEdit #2: What a dip! Guess the large volume of puts purchased this morning had the intended effect. Why else would you buy so many already ITM puts? Volume doesn't explain the dip, so I'm guessing that it was the puts. Lot of upward resistance at $30. Currently seeing a but wall of 11,500 shares at $30. Will assume that is the floor for now.",
        "257":"Lumen Technologies Inc (LUMN) - Too Late To the Party?  r\/wallstreetbets\n\nHello, fellow retards and autists.  I need to borrow your diligent, Aspergers level analytics ability and earth-shatteringly, retarded reasoning to pile drive my portfolio into the red.  I can't believe I'm actually coming here for advice.  Please see the \"case study\" below.\n\nI'm a huge fan of Dr. Michael Burry and how he manages Scion Asset Management, LLC. The guy does his due-diligence and thinks about his investment opportunities from an outside perspective. If the numbers and story pencil, he will bet against anyone and doesn't let the court of public opinion cloud his judgment.\n\nI'm inquiring about the recent Lumen Technologies (formerly CenturyLink) $LUMN trade.\n\nBased on my research, Scion Asset Management acquired 1.15M shares of $LUMN at an average value of $9.74 per share. This trade accounts for approx. 8.02% of Scion's portfolio. If we're looking at Burry's past investments, he's usually one of the first players to the table including both $GME (#diamond hands) and shorting the housing market. \n\nLumen has not only rebranded their name and marketing efforts, but their entire business strategy moving forward by selling B2B data and fiber optic services since many customers are moving away from phone lines\/services: (direct quotes from my research)...\n\n1. \"**Lumen** is a measure of the brightness of light, and the company\u2019s competitive advantage this century has come from its massive fiber network, stretching 450,000 route miles. That has helped CenturyLink survive even as consumers cut their home phone lines in favor of wireless providers and switched off DSL in favor of faster alternatives. But transporting light signals can also be a commodity service. Lumen is now pushing to offer more higher-value applications and enterprise services directly to its customers, reflected in the company\u2019s new motto: \u201c**The Platform for Amazing Things**.\u201d\n2. \"Lumen, which was primarily an ISP\/Phone company, stepped up their B2B and backbone connectivity to major Internet companies which the purchase of Level3. They'll be key to serving as the fiber backbone for 5G.\"\n\nEarlier today, I submitted a limit buy order for $LUMN @ $14.00 which won't be executed until tomorrow when the market opens. I don't believe this trade will turn a real profit for 1-2 years as turning a battleship of this size takes a significant amount of time and resources. But looking at the story and fundamentals, the strategy is sound. Outside the rebranding and change of strategy, Lumen is using some of the newly minted capital to paydown, high interest, debt.\n\nAm I too late on this trade or too retarded to function?

Do you remember the time the shittingers started dipping and halting the stocks? No ... WELL I DO! It was excactly 12:20 when the shitters shitstorm started shitting.\n\n\n**Fact 2:** Yesterday was the same thing going on. Shitters formed an new bottom dip, for us to buy, and we love them because of that \u2764\ufe0f. The interesting thing here is, that the shitting and dipping and halting started at 12:20!\n\n**Conclusion**: WHAT AN AMAZING COINCIDENCE?! Yeahh... not excatly. We would like to call it here shitter\u2019s market manipulation.\n\nSSR has been triggered for the last trading days, which helped us to form an strong support at 13$.

        "266":"Why AMC is not the same as GME Ok retards, listen up. Just because AMC has performed in lockstep in the past with GME does not mean this will continue indefinitely.\n\nAMC is not GME. AMC\u2019s management has issued a massive amount of shares proportional to previous outstanding shares to pay down their loans and rent, taken on new European debt, and the largest share holder has reduced from >50% to <10% stake. AMC will survive, but only because new shareholders are bailing them out by paying pre-dilution prices for new share offerings which directly allow the company the cash needed to pay their landlords. You aren\u2019t buying value or even contributing to a war chest that can be used for expansion, new shareholders who bought ATM offerings are giving the company cash just to survive. If you love the chain, want to contribute your money to their survival, and are aware of the dilution of outstanding shares (quoted at 450.2 million outstanding during the earnings call last week) then more power to you.  However, if you think AMC is anything like GME you have another thing coming. At least GME has a short squeeze thesis that management isn\u2019t actively sabotaging by issuing shares and Robert Cohen represents hope of future growth beyond what is possible for the business at present.\n\nIf you feel differently I would be happy to hear why you believe this company can increase shareholder value to compensate for the share dilution.

        "272":"Simplifying Law DD series part II - NSCC rules relating to their 'watchlist' and margin Here we go, another entry into the series for my own amusement as I jot things down and attempt to make legal nonsense, sense. If you other apes gain a wrinkle or two too, well that's just gravy.\n\nPart I [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/m3vhmg\/simplying_law_dd_series_nscc_rule_18_and_gme\/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)\n\nLet me clarify first, the point of this series is to grant a better understanding for us apes on how the NSCC (and DTCC) does business, or any other legal stuff for that matter, relating to securities. This is to prevent FUD surrounding quotes of rules or rulings which, when taken out of context, seem like they won't help \/ cause fear in the DTCC and co won't pay or find a way out of paying when the inevitable squeeze happens, in addition to the new rule.\n\n*If you don't want to read my stuff, just know the DTCC is and remains on the hook should a member default and they have so much credit, cash and assets the squeeze will hurt, but never finish them, maybe*\n\nAnyway, I had the thought that surely the NSCC (and therefore by extension, the DTCC and sister companies) doesn't just wait until the proverbial shit hits the fan, or waits till the ass is primed in the fan's direction after a spicy meal, before it decides to protect itself. Big money likes to stay big money. You may think well no shit, but I doubt many of you know exactly how they do so.\n\nThis DD relates to what the NSCC and co does *before* a member (such as Citadel) or their family affiliates securities (such as Melvin) Default and enter Rule 18 i.e. Part I and defaults), **in addition to the new SLD filing**.\n\nAs always, not financial advice, do your own research and if that means you point to me and say stupid ape wrong, I'm glad to hear it. Fling it at me.\n\nOnto the DD, it actually relates to an amendment of rule which is thankfully 10 pages long.\n\nThe rule amendment I'm looking at (File No. SR.-NSCC-2017-010) relates to how the NSCC detects funky trade moves from members and affiliates, and determines margin payments. Remember the NSCC handles the majority of clearing, so they know what's been traded, in the vast majority of cases. \n\nThe FICC also knows what they're worth too, so they can assess a member and any affiliates' ability to settle their portfolio when things get hairy, both from a portfolio and financial standpoint. The NSCC and FICC work together on this.\n\nSo the NSCC has something called a 'risk matrix' which helps them determine a member's margin, or a charge they have to pay into the NSCC's clearing fund, depending on how much risk their portfolio places the NSCC under with respect to their positions and financial clout.\n\nI can't shake the imagery that this rule is like members and their affiliates are aware the market is a simulation and get slaps on the wrist if they fuck with it, whereas we apes are forced to play by the rules, until we came along and ate the red pill that is GME when they were caught with their pants down. I digress.\n\nThe clearing fund is the 'uh oh someone may default and we need to settle' cash reserve, and it is collected from all members, even those on the right side of trades. They just pay less, but every member has to pay into it to protect the NSCC, the price of membership. The difference is, those more in risk pay more to account for their risky portfolio.\n\nAs I said, the risk matrix extends to all members and affiliates, and it represents a measurement like a credit rating. To calculate the risk, the NSCC gathers up all their member's portfolio info and the FICC tells them what each of their financial capabilities are. An algorithm then determines a rating.\n\nAs an example, you're potentially in the hole for $2b and you have a total assets and liquidity of $2.5b, matrix sends alarm bells to the NSCC of crap this member's or this affiliate is in the shit, scrape some money now or it'll hurt you later. A good member may get AAA rating if their risk is nowhere near what they're worth, so a token donation from you.\n\nFurther, if you find yourself on the NSCC watchlist, well your margin payment is going to increase too. Those on the watchlist are essentially those with a bad 'credit rating\" in the eyes of the matrix, who either continue or increase in that position, or else have failed to raise enough capital to balance their risk relative to their assets or both. This rule SPECIFICALLY brings in affiliate investments, likely so risky positions can't be held in such entities without risk.\n\n*An aside - could this be why Citadel invested in Melvin? It's speculative but imagine you've lost billions and then you're slapped with a fat margin bill as you can't exit the position or else default, seems like a great time for a predatory institution to come in and grab your shares at discount prices. Just saying.*\n\nSo how does this relate to the situation? Well as Part I described you want to avoid defaulting as much as possible or else your ass gets liquidated.\n\nSpeculation: Now imagine you're a Melvin who's lost billions and doesn't have the capital to front the charge for your risky position, you then default and your ass gets liquidated and that's you done, out the market. Citadel steps in and 'invests' in you so you can sell out your risky positions to them and you can legally say you closed out your position and their assets make the charge less because your position in the matrix is better as you're better capitalized.\n\nNext, you try and tank the stock but it doesn't work. Citadel then has the increased charge for their position with each day that goes by. The current SLD is measured against the last 24 months trading and the investment into Melvin you can hide as it wasn't your investment, but you're eating a lot of money in interest.\n\nThe longer this goes on for higher prices, the quicker you're done. When the SLD rules come into place and the NSCC demands a larger sum of what you can handle when the rule change passes, you default and they settle you out. The incentive is only to keep kicking the can down the road and pray retail gets bored as both of you are done if this doesn't happen. Which it won't if apes hold.\n\nTLDR: this situation for Melvin and Citadel is like being stuck in an underwater cave and finding an oxygen tank from another trapped person. Sure, you'll last longer, but that canister will run out eventually and you're done.",

        "284":"Trading Tips for Novice Apes I scored me an Adderall yesterday and in my amphetamine-induced madness sat down and wrote a bunch of rambling crap about trading stonks and options for beginners. I know, let's let the newbies lose all their money and clean out this trash-heap, but come on, the paper trading competition is more effective than sheer stupidity. Anyways, here's some tips to not lose money, at least not as quickly as $800 GME calls.\n\n  DiVeRsIfY!\n\nOptions are great. No, not those kind of options, but options like how normal people use the word. Basically when trading it\u2019s hard to be right 100% of the time, so why risk your whole account by owning a single stock? It\u2019s dangerous because *you will be wrong* and if you bet it all when you\u2019re wrong, even if it is rare, you\u2019re out of the game. All the money is gone. You might even *owe money to the broker* if you did something really dumb.\n\nDiversification is sometimes laughed about, even by giants like Warren Buffet. He famously said something like, \u201cPut all your eggs in one basket *and watch the basket*.\u201d He\u2019s not wrong, but most people don\u2019t know what to look for regarding dangers to this basket. There could be a wolf about to eat all the eggs and we wouldn\u2019t know it. *We wouldn\u2019t even know what a wolf looks like!* My point is unless you\u2019re an expert at knowing market conditions, economic conditions, and are great at reading 10-Ks and 10-Qs like a wizard, you probably can\u2019t watch the basket very well.\n\nPersonally, I admit I don\u2019t know shit about companies. I invest in meme stocks that have high options premium. That\u2019s my investment strategy. My egg basket is, well, I don\u2019t know what it is, but it sure isn\u2019t something that has any business holding eggs. The eggs could be eaten, spoiled (there's probably an option expiration joke here), or be stolen at any moment and that\u2019s why I have multiple baskets. One or two of the baskets can get stolen\/eaten, and I still have eight more. I can and will be wrong, and at most it\u2019ll wipe out 10% of my holdings. I, and you, can happily easily take a 10% hit to the investment account and be able to function.\n\nThis play more into my next tip: be stoic. By diversifying you can remove extreme emotion from your investing\/trading.\n\n## Be Calm. Be Chill. Be Stoic. It\u2019s just money after all!\n\nYou are your main enemy to stock market success. It\u2019s not market makers, shorts, or other traders; they only use you against yourself. Why? Because you\u2019re a person. You have emotions. You\u2019re stupid and irrational and emotional. Money is on the line; you know the thing we all trade for shelter, food, good, and everything? Money is fundamentally tied to emotion, so when your money starts to get messed with you get stupid. Think of all the silly shit you\u2019ve done and said on an emotional high or low. You may have drunkenly told someone you loved them, kicked someone\u2019s ass, bought something stupid, and apply this to your investment account. How are you going to treat hundreds or thousands of investment money if you\u2019re emotional? When a stock you own (please be diversified!) drops 60% and your money disappears what do you do? You have a choice and emotion will only make the choice harder to make.\n\nI don\u2019t really have a tip here because it\u2019s something you learn to deal with. There is no magical key to not being emotional when money is involved (besides shutting your phone off and going for a walk), but just know that it is immensely important, more than any other thing, to keep emotion in check in regards to investing. I do have a few tips on things to be aware of though. Luckily they have names so by labeling them you can recognize what\u2019s happening and combat it.\n\n## FOMO\n\nFear of Missing Out. You watch a stock you were kinda thinking about buying jump 300% in a few days. People at work are talking about their hot stock that's printing them tendies. You start to think that maybe you missed the boat -- you dragged your feet and are sitting out riding the rocket to the moon -- or did you? Maybe it\u2019ll go up another 300% *if you get in ASAP!* Yeah, that\u2019s a great idea. You\u2019re not even greedy, you just want it to go up a little bit so you can feel like you were part of the moon mission, and that\u2019s not hard to do, right? Surely if it went up so quickly, it\u2019ll keep going up at least until you sell.\n\nWrong. This is a terrible idea. Hype is dangerous. FOMO is why people I work with are chucking money into \\[redacted\\] at $50,000 after it went up 1,000% in a year. This is why people are *still* bagholding GameStop at $450 per share. This is why a large portion of bagholders exist in the first place; their still holding onto their $18 AMCs they bought a few months ago no wanting to take the loss.\n\nIf you find yourself experiencing HARD FOMO and *just can\u2019t resist*, buy yourself a small portion. Don\u2019t go crazy. Don\u2019t \u201cinvest\u201d anything more than you\u2019re willing to lose. Using \\[redacted\\] again, if you invested $1,000 at $50,000 and \\[redacted\\] went down to $5,000, would you be fine with it? You turned $1,000 into $100 and how would you feel? There is a low enough point where it\u2019s stomachable, so invest that. I\u2019m not buying \\[redacted\\] but if I did I\u2019d be okay with a $500 \"investment.\" If I lose it, it\u2019s fine, and I won\u2019t lose sleep over it. FOMO is dangerous so be aware of it.\n\n## FUD\/Dooming\n\nThe opposite of FOMO: Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt. This can be caused by your family questioning what the hell you bought, news stories, internet shitposts, etc. and make you scared to hold your stock\/option because you're worried the price will crash. These pale in comparison to witnessing a beloved stock you owe totally collapse in price. You watch your thousands of dollars of gain disappear in a few days (or maybe hours) and what do you do? You panic sell. You're $10,000 profit is down to $7,000, $6,000 and $5,000 and *OMG how much worse can it get! I could lose all my profit!* You panic sell and realize a $2,000 gain, but oh how you kick yourself in the ass for not getting out at the top. You were greedy, you feel like shit. You're the worst trader ever.\n\nThen the next day the stock goes up and you get a side of FOMO to go with your main-course FUD. *If only you held...but maybe it's not too late to jump back in?*\n\nAs before, no real tips on this one. It's also hard to give tips for when something emotional is happening. It's easy to say \"*don't panic sell!*\" but when you're on the verge of panic selling its hard to detach yourself from the numbers on your screen and actually not panic sell. Only with hindsight do you realize how much of a paper-handed bitch you were.\n\nLike with FOMO, a good recipe for mitigating FUD is to give into your emotions just a little bit so you feel like you're doing something. If you want to sell as a stock is crashing, sell half. Sell a third. You don't need to sell it all and regret it later. And if you have truly massive balls, you can always *buy more shares on the way down!*\n\n## No Regrets! No \"what ifs\"!\n\nThere's few things worse than seeing an \"investment\" work out better than you expected but to not sell at the top. You're always haunted by the \"what if I just did this\u2026\" A stock triples, you don't sell, and then it's back to where you bought it at. You could've raked in *so much money* but you held too long and raked in absolutely nothing.\n\nThen there's the opposite problem: selling too early. You got greedy\/scared and took a 10% gain when you could've had a 1000% gain. This was me with *GameStop* in January. I had 400 shares total and sold them around $30-40. Sure I made $5,000 but I could've had $150,000 if I held on for another week or so! Try not to kick yourself in the ass for missing like that and tell me how well it goes. It's hard.\n\nAt least I didn't FOMO back in. I realized my mistake -- I sold too early -- and am trying my best to not let it haunt me. Everything is clear with hindsight and what I did made sense at the time. Trading is stupidly hard and no one perfectly buys at the bottom or sells at the top and as long as you come out ahead, who cares? I'm not the guy holding bags at $450 a share, and at least I was in the play and made some significant cash. As always, easier said than done, but try not to be too hard on yourself for not being perfect.\n\nMy tip here is to take profits as you wish. You can probably tell that I'm a big fan of taking half-measures -- selling half, buying half -- because you're doing something and doing something feels good. If a stock goes up 20% and you want to sell, sell half. Realize some profits and let the rest ride. If it goes up even more, sell half of those, and so on. This isn't a rule, just an idea. You feel good taking profits but leaving some on the table does wonders for the \"what if\" thoughts that might haunt you.\n\nThe same is true for buying. Buy half of what you want and see how it plays out. If the stock goes down, buy more. This keeps you safe from tossing in a ton of money at a high price, but makes you feel good for getting some cash in the game.\n\nDisclaimer: I like the stock. This is financial advice.",
        "288":"\u2753GME \ud83d\udcc8& QQQ \ud83d\udcc9last week The biggest story this month in mainstream finance media was the sudden spike in the interest rate for 10 year US government bonds and the effect it was having on the stock market. In this edition of DDDD (Data-Driven DD), we\u2019ll be taking a look at why the 10-year interest rate is important, how it has led to rising asset prices over the past few decades (i.e. creating an asset bubble), and how GME is involved with all of this.\n\n*Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion and for ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up and with some satire thrown in. Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*\n\nThis DDDD recycles a bit of content from some other DDDDs I\u2019ve previously posted, connecting the dots between some of the other topics covered in them; so if you\u2019re especially bored and want to learn more about things talked about in this post, check them out!\n\n[The 2010-2020 Liquidity-Fueled Asset Bubble](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/ghcfn5\/dddd_the_20102020_liquidityfueled_asset_bubble\/)\n\n[Cycles & Human History](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/gqgwfg\/dddd_cycles_and_human_history\/)\n\n[Ray Dalio\u2019s Thesis](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/hhrkwu\/a_smooth_brained_guide_to_ray_dalios_thesis\/)\n\n**What is the 10-year US treasury and why is the yield so important?**\n\nThe 10 year treasury is an IOU sold by the US government when it needs to borrow money, promising to pay it back in 10 years with regular interest payment in the meantime. They auction off these bonds to the highest bidder, and the price that these bonds get sold off at determines the yield of these bonds. In finance, US bonds are considered to be a risk-free asset, since it\u2019s the safest possible investment anyone can make (at least in theory). Because of this, the 10 year US bond yield is considered to be the \u201crisk free rate\u201d for any long-term investments and acts as gravity towards any other riskier investments.\n\n**Why does the 10-year affect the price of every other asset?**\n\nAs a rule of thumb, the riskier an asset is, the higher return (or yield) that asset will need to provide. For things like bonds, are pretty straight-forward - it\u2019s the yield, or effective interest rate that bond provides. For things like equities (stocks), it\u2019s a bit more complicated. As a hand-wavy approach, a lot of people use Earnings, so let\u2019s go with that. % return demanded by investors = earnings \/ price, meaning price is inversely proportional to % return, or **if % return demanded \ud83d\udcc8 price \ud83d\udcc9** **and vice versa**.\n\nThis is how the treasury yields affect the price of literally everything else (except GME), from real estate to SPY. Suppose that JPow decided overnight that he changed his mind and managed to pump up the 10-year rate to 10%, which is where it was at for most of the 1980s. Compared to SPY, which is maybe giving you a return of 2.5% (based on the current PE ratio of 40), any \ud83e\udd8d with more than two brain cells can figure out the better deal. So everyone sells their SPY and loads up on treasuries until SPY drops enough (i.e. falls 75%) to at very least match the return of the 10-year, and likely even more due to the increased risk and volatility (risk premium).\n\n[S&P 500 Earnings Yield vs. 10Y Treasury Yield](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/pg68b4n39hm61.png?width=1450&format=png&auto=webp&s=457e43c3379aa0cef7424de824904d2c8f66e556)\n\nThere\u2019s several other mechanisms that this rate affects various asset prices as well\n\n1. Housing prices - For the same reasons, a rise in the 10-year = a rise in mortgage rates. So if the prime mortgage rate doubles from 3% (today) to 6%, to buy the same $250K house, a 30-year mortgage will go from a $1000 monthly payment to a $1500 monthly payment, which might be more than what people looking at $250K houses can afford. This would thus cause a decline in housing prices until the people who would\u2019ve previously bought those houses can afford it again.\n2. Stock buybacks - A low 10-year = low corporate bond yields = incentivizes businesses to take on the cheap debt, even if they don\u2019t need it. What do they do with that excess capital? Usually, stock buybacks or dividend payments, which drives up their own stock prices - something executives are especially incentivized to do since their compensation is usually tied to stock price performance. What happens when the 10-year and corporate bond interest rates go back up? Those companies who took on a bunch of debt probably won\u2019t refinance their bonds when they expire, and will need to divert their resources from dividend and stock buybacks to paying down their debt, possibly even issuing more shares to raise capital to pay it back, lowering their stock price.\n3. Leverage - Treasury rates set the bar for the lowest interest rates someone can borrow at, including hedge funds to borrow cash to buy stocks on margin. To dumb it down, if a hedge fund finds some combination of trades that yield a 5% return with low risk and can borrow from their broker at 2%, they could lever up 10x (theyre not subject to the 2x leverage limit retail investors have) and get a 50% return while paying 20% in interest. What happens when treasury rates go up, causing their interest rates they pay to their brokerage go up? They sell those holdings, and since most funds are net-bullish on the market, this usually means a mass sell-off in the stock market.\n\n**How the Fed controls the 10-year yield**\n\nThe Fed\u2019s official mission is to\n\n1. Ensure price stability, this usually means that they target a 2% inflation rate\n2. Try to achieve \u201cfull employment\u201d, which is basically the lowest unemployment rate that's practically achievable\n\nThey achieve this through two mechanisms.\n\n1. The Fed Funds Rate - This is what they use during normal times. This is basically the interest rates the banks within the Federal Reserve System lends to each other overnight, which they can set a ceiling and floor to by establishing a rate that any bank can borrow or lend the Fed at any time\n2. Quantitative Easing \/ Tightening - This is an unconventional tool they usually resort to once the Fed Funds Rate reaches zero (for Easing) to further stimulate the economy to further pump liquidity by directly buying Treasuries \/ government bonds, and sometimes other assets like Mortgage Backed Securities and Corporate Bonds.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty obvious from above how the Fed can affect the 10-year note, especially with quantitative easing, where they might directly buy it, causing the price to decrease from an increased demand and reducing the yield as a result.\n\n**What Happened Last Week**\n\nSo what happened with the 10-year yield last week? It **\ud83d\ude80 \ud83c\udf1d**, which for reasons mentioned above, means that everything else **\ud83d\udcc9.**\n\n[10Y Treasury Yield, Daily](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/luroj2b79hm61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ad89ea67d4e86e555d39008d51d5cdc8fa8ec0d)\n\n*Why did the 10-year yield* ***\ud83d\ude80 \ud83c\udf1d***\\*?\\*\n\nBasically, there was a lot of speculation recently that we might see inflation as the economy opens up.\n\n*Why does the economy reopening = inflation?*\n\nThere\u2019s this macroeconomic theory called the Quantity Theory of Money - ***MV = PQ***, where M is the quantity of Money in the system, V is the velocity of money, P is the price level, and Q is the GDP. A rise in P = inflation.\n\nIn this equation, the key variable is the velocity of money, which is the speed at which money circulates in an economy, or in other words, how fast consumers will spend a dollar once they earn it. Interestingly enough, ever since the 2000s, and especially after the 2008 recession, velocity of money has been steadily declining, mostly due to rising income inequality as richer people tend to spend money less quickly than poorer people who might be living paycheck to paycheck. However, when COVID hit, it really \ud83d\udcc9 fast.\u200b\n\n[Velocity of M2 Money](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/j7mi0ed99hm61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=34d61275d0dc17bfbd82e6a16c3dc7beb1751a0e)\n\nSo with Q (GDP) and M (Money Supply) being equal, this would generally mean P going down as well, or in other words, deflation - the Fed\u2019s worst nightmare. How do central banks combat this? By increasing M proportionally to the decrease in V.\n\n[M2 Money Stock](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/hdg62w7b9hm61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=78de5d86fb81951af79939159662a0a442dc28dc)\n\n*By what mechanism does the Fed increase M?*\n\nUsing the two mechanisms described above. Right when COVID hit, they immediately dropped the Fed Funds Rate to 0. They quickly realized that wasn\u2019t enough, and started buying government and corporate bonds on-mass until they were confident it would prevent deflation. This has the side-effect of decreasing the 10-year yield, and making all other assets go up. If you look closely, though you\u2019ll see that they really turned off the printing press after the summer.\n\nSo, what happens when the economy opens back up? V goes up, maybe back to normal. So the Fed has two options according to the Quantity Theory of Money\n\n1. Let M (money supply) stay where it is. This means that P will go up, or in other words, inflation\n2. Prevent inflation by decreasing M. This will have the opposite effect of what was described above, and sending the 10-year yields \ud83d\udcc8 and all asset prices **\ud83d\udcc9**\n\n[Fed Balance Sheet](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/h9buyb8g9hm61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=33fe1010414625a0fa585b18d144d4a396ec86ee)\n\n*What did JPowell say?*\n\nHe basically confirmed what everyone was thinking - **inflation is coming**. However, he did say that he was comfortable letting inflation go above its 2% target until jobs recover and the Fed achieves its second mandate - full employment.\n\n*Why did what he say cause yields to go up regardless?*\n\nBasically, people were expecting him to announce that he was going to turn the money printer back on and increase the number of treasury purchases to force the 10-year yield back down. He did not do that, which indicates that he\u2019s changing his stance to actually try to be careful to not overheat the economy, and that he might actually be worried about inflation since he went against what the entire market assumed he would do, and priced in to do.\n\nAt very least, this means that we probably shouldn\u2019t be counting on the Fed\u2019s money printer continuously driving up asset prices anytime soon. In the medium term, if inflation does get bad enough, it shows at least some willingness from the Fed that they may actually intervene and decrease the money supply - causing everything else to crash alongside it. Will it happen? Well that depends on how bad this inflation gets, and how bad the Fed is willing to stand by and watch it happen until they do something.\n\n**Why I am a \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b in the medium term**\n\nThe re-opening might force the Fed to do something that they haven\u2019t done in a very long time - quantitative tightening.\n\n[Velocity of M2 Money](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/8p3hqx7i9hm61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=205278bd73362c102770641b4f54c38d51543133)\n\n[CPI Inflation Rate](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/yrhmwgri9hm61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=3dfb5226811e57354406cc24bcd51b34d685c882)\n\n[Fed Funds Rate](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/yu9fv9aj9hm61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=d5c7370b4d7999b623f05b65e5e789b21511e764)\n\n[3 Month Treasury Yield](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/1rsq9aqj9hm61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=779e5c7ed33361b74878209a80dc2fa41c849834)\n\n[10Y Treasury Yield](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/arepvz9k9hm61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=280e9c6de172228942c2a790a35baea3b3ec547b)\n\n[S&P 500 Shiller PE Ratio](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/hi6hz5uk9hm61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2d019a99e2b2f52df0cf4941fb4015a673a9652)\n\n[Rent to Housing Price Ratio](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/aexotxbl9hm61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=a0eac41c1f1b2c0f9e11284b9459b19804d03949)\n\n[Hedge Fund Gross Leverage](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/0jjgz0wl9hm61.png?width=1448&format=png&auto=webp&s=f583482a4f461048f961e89158a1413121de37c2)\n\nIf you look closely at these charts, you can put yourself in the shoes of the Fed and see why stonks only went \ud83d\udcc8 in the past decade.\n\n* The 2008 recession caused a permanent decline in velocity of money that has never actually really recovered - likely due to the increased income inequality that never reversed since then\n* Decreased velocity of money = decreased P, or deflation, in the long term with all things equal\n* To avoid this, the Fed drops the Fed Funds rate to 0, followed by quantitative easing on treasuries, dropping their yield as well, to increase the money supply to keep the inflation rate near their target\n* Since velocity of money never really recovered, they just left the money they pumped in and the low interest rates they set at the 2008 recession there and barely touched it until 2017, where they slowly raised it until they abruptly stopped in 2018 - we\u2019ll get to what happened when they did that in a bit\n* With all this extra liquidity in the system keeping the 10-year low, when the economy did eventually recover from the 2008 recession, all asset prices, including the stock market and real estate prices **\ud83d\ude80 \ud83c\udf1d** for virtually every year - except for 2018 - we\u2019ll also get to that in a bit\n\n**What Happened in 2018?**\n\n[SPY, near 2018](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/efjhgufw9hm61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e99c92f0e9f22bf26f2f8bf17e9c740021b6c27)\n\n[Fed Funds Rate, near 2018](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/woz6w4ww9hm61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=e539f1f4ef0ea0a96a90e0c59dd766b603087ff1)\n\nThroughout 2017, but especially in 2018, the Fed finally decided to slowly start increasing the Fed Funds rate back up from basically 0%, almost 10 years after the 2008 recession; the first quantitative tightening we\u2019ve since then.

This is usually a signal of lack of confidence in investors in asset prices, which in turn caused the stock market to crash, leading to one of the only >1% decline year in the S&P500 since 2009.\n\nSo my thesis for is that in the next few years, one of the following must happen\n\n* Velocity of Money never recovers to pre-COVID levels. TBH this is probably the best case scenario for the stock market, but is probably REALLY bad for the economy. The only way for this to really happen is we remain in a K-shaped recovery, where we continue to have high-unemployment for lower paying jobs and high income inequality\n* Velocity of Money recovers to near pre-COVID levels, the Fed either continues quantitative easing or does not do quantitative tightening. This will eventually lead to inflation well above the Fed\u2019s 2% target. JPowell has shown so far that although he would accept this temporarily without doing any action but left the door open for quantitative tightening if he sees sustained over-inflation, which is possible (and imo likely) given the amount of money pumped into the economy over the year + how much the velocity of money dropped last year.\n* Velocity of Money recovers to near pre-COVID levels, and the Fed decides to do some sort of quantitative tightening in the medium term after seeing sustained over-inflation. If this happens, we will find out how much of the last decade\u2019s stock market gains were from real productivity increases, and how much of it was from the Fed\u2019s monetary policy.\n\n*What do I think? Short term, anything can happen so no I'm not buying SPY puts again. I am, however, not going long on anything outside of a 6 month time frame. Why? Ask yourself this - what do you really think has been the primary driver of the stock market's rise over the past decade: Fundamental economic growth? Or is it the Fed's money printing. Now, ask yourself, how long can that driver keep going for? The money printer was on overdrive the past few months to compensate for COVID; how long could this last until we see inflation and it forces JPowell to turn off the printer?*\n\n***TLDR; Stonks only go \ud83d\udcc8 if you have the Fed on your side. If the Fed ever decides (or needs to) changes sides, bulls r fucked***\n\n**Why GME \ud83d\ude80 \ud83c\udf1d when everything else \ud83d\udcc9**\n\nNot really related to the thesis, and [I briefly talked about this a few weeks ago](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/l9sh9e\/dddd_why_gme_might_next_week_and_how_it_could\/), but it seems to be what everyone talks about nowadays so I guess I\u2019ll talk about this too. I\u2019m sure some of y\u2019all have noticed that every time every other stock goes down, GME usually \ud83d\udcc8 and vice versa, and especially wrinkly brained ape [did the math](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/lteecj\/gme_may_have_the_potential_to_dictate_the_course\/) and found a statistically significant inverse correlation between GME and the rest of the stock market. Why is that? Well, in short\n\n1. Virtually nobody buying GME now is doing so because of earnings yield \/ they did a DCF on the company and thought that it was undervalued at $50 based on future cash flows, so the 10-year yield increasing is meaningless to them\n2. Institutions \/ Hedge Funds that are on the other side of the trade need to de-gross their books whenever the stock market goes down. In short, some hedge funds tend to take an insane amount of leverage (eg. the mean gross leverage of a hedge fund is around 8x right now). They can do this because their \u201cnet exposure\u201d, which is their long exposure - short exposure is much lower, and isn\u2019t as risky because they are \u201chedged\u201d vs. market conditions. Gross exposure, on the other hand, is the total value of long and short positions they hold. So, if they sell off a long position, they need to sell a short position if they\u2019ve levered up in this way, and vice versa. It\u2019s pretty well known that hedge funds love big tech stocks and like shorting AMC and GME. So, if they exit out of their tech \/ growth longs to reduce their gross leverage, they\u2019ll also need to cover their GME shorts as well.\n\n*PS - This will probably be my final DDDD, at least for a while. I'll be back when shit starts to get crazy \/ interesting again.*",

        "293":"$DGX Quest Diagnostics Pt. 2 - Electric Boogaloo So a few weeks back I posted a DD for $DGX (Quest Diagnostics): [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/lktkjr\/dgx\\_quest\\_diagnostics\\_is\\_free\\_tendies\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/lktkjr\/dgx_quest_diagnostics_is_free_tendies\/)\n\n**TL;DR** **so you can get back to $GME memes:** $DGX is the safest double up+ opportunity in the market right now. Based on management's own conservative EPS forecasts (**excl repurchases**), a PE of 10 at mid year results in a share price of $144. This is the absolute floor target. They also announced unprecedented $2b in share repurchases for 2021, meaning they can repurchase over 16m shares at current levels. Their float is 133m shares, **BUT roughly 90% of that is owned by INSTITUIONS, leaving LESS THAN 16m** ***available*** **to public.** Assuming institutions continue to hold the majority of their shares (they will. it's a safe dividend stock), this stock will rocket by end of year.\n\n............................................................................................................................................................\n\nAs is WSB tradition, my one and only concern (a general market downturn) came to fruition shortly after posting the initial DD linked above. So my sincerest apologies for tanking the market over the last couple weeks. I'm now in your debt and, like a Lannister, intend on paying up. Continue reading unless you hate money.\n\nQuest presents a very low risk opportunity to double up at a minimum. No, it probably won't be a 10 bagger, but you'll at least be able to use the tendies to cover your taxes after $GME moons. **So here's part 2 of my $DGX callout (read part 1 first you jackass):**\n\n$DGX has been trading at roughly $11 PE for over 2 weeks now. The share price remains literally FLAT vs pre-Covid February of 2020. Which is hilarious considering:\n\n* All significant competitors are up AT LEAST 20% in that timeframe. Including Labcorp.\n* Back to back Qs of record breaking Revenue (50%+ y\/y) and EPS (100%+ y\/y).\n* A plethora of additional reasons from DD part 1 linked above, **including $2B in share buybacks announced and approved for 2021.**\n\nThis is practically a ZERO risk trade, which is even more incredible when considering recent market volatility. Since 2006, $DGX has only traded below a PE of 9 once....doing so for a mere 30 days. It has typically traded around 15 PE during that time overall. I know, I know. You're thinking *wtf is this guy rambling about historical PEs for. And he already said they are at 11. And 11 > 9, I think, so WHO CARES?!*\n\n**What if I told you that the EPS guidance given during Q4 guidance puts their diluted TTM EPS at 14.38 through Q2 of 2021?** To put it more simply for the slow kids in the back munching on crayons, if EPS targets are hit, then **$DGX would need to be trading at $144\/share to result in a conservative PE of just 10 by Q2.** If they return to 15 PE by serology advancements, acquisitions, base testing rush, and share buybacks, the share price would be $216. Key notes:\n\n* Guidance was only given for first half of 2021. They will beat the top revenue and EPS #s given. They ALWAYS do because this mgmt group is a bunch of sandbagging pricks. They were the kid in school that always said he failed an exam, only to receive a 98 and set the curve for the class. **Rev**: $4.85b to $5.15b. **EPS**: $5.07 to $6.07.\n* \\^ They. Will. Beat. Both. Top. Numbers. But my 14.38 minimum EPS above uses a conservative $6 projection anyway.\n* Additionally, management stated the EPS guidance given does NOT factor in an unprecedented **$2billion authorization of share repurchases, which is a massive amount when you consider 90% of their outstanding shares are owned by institutions.** For context, they seem intent on repurchasing **6x the amount of shares repurchased in 2020.**\n\nThe overblown trashbag \"analyst\" concerns remain the same from DD part 1. COVID testing will just disappear over night and Quest's core business will take a while to return.\n\n* COVID faucet is gonna get shut off quickly, eh? Yet in reality, public data shows daily testing remains absurdly high. In fact, the lowest testing day so far in Q1 is still higher than the highest day from May-Oct 2020. The overall Q1 daily average remains over DOUBLE that period as well. Heck, even Quest's own press release indicates COVID testing remains absurdly high through Feb for them specifically: [https:\/\/newsroom.questdiagnostics.com\/COVIDTestingUpdates](https:\/\/newsroom.questdiagnostics.com\/COVIDTestingUpdates)\n* Even as COVID testing drops off, it will be offset by massive returns in $DGX base work to pre pandemic levels. Personally, I think there's a strong case to be made for a rapid return in their base business as people catchup on postponed doctor visits and procedures. Small boost from employment screenings as well.\n* I've spoken with several Doctor\/PA\/Nurse friends across 8 different hospitals and they've said that over the past 2 weeks they've seen a dramatic shift in patients. **They are SWAMPED, but not with COVID patients.** This anecdotal reinforces the bullet above. DGX base business is going to return quicker than people think, AND they will still be able to continue a large amount of COVID testing (still happening based on the #s, just less hospital involvement thanks to drive-throughs and other 3rd parties).\n* The $1.9T stimulus package includes $50 billion specifically for \"testing and contact tracing\". The bill also references an unspecific amount for serology\/analytics\/researching viruses.\n* Quest also has seen a dramatic uptick in users on their tech platforms: Quest Quanum (provider focused) and MyQuest (patient focused). You can bet they will be able to monetize this data for research too down the road. In this day in age, data is everything.\n\n**Price expectations by end of year. Raises vs part 1 as I've gained more testing\/quest data into Q:**\n\n* Worst case - $150. Yea, I'm serious. Baring a market meltdown, this baby is a lock.\n* Best case - $200\n\n**Positions**\n\n* Sold position (2\/19 $130 calls) pre-earnings during run up for 400%+ return in roughly 3 weeks\n* Holding: $50k in shares\n* Open: May 21 $125, $130, $140.

Was there some news or was it a big, massive, \"UGE\" sell off by a single entity?

I know they are not supposed to interfere with the market, but the belief\/conspiracy theory is that they do. \n\nEither way - someone doesn't want GME back over $400. It's hard to believe that this could be tied to any other stock. (Of course, it could be coincidence, but COME ON MAN!)

If you think there was institutional influence holding down GME, you haven't seen anything yet. \n\nASO has a much smaller float, 32 million, compared to GME's 50m, SKT's 90m, and RKT's 106m. It also has a much smaller average daily volume, compared to the other most shorted stocks, at 1.5 million. Although $40 options just opened up, previously the only OTM options were $25, $30 and $35. If you look at the last few weeks price at expiry you will see, for instance last week, that at expiry the price was just below $25 and immediately went up past $25 after the options expired worthless. \n\nThis is a company that had a breakout earnings beating both earnings and revenue and has another earnings announcement coming this month. Last earnings was so great because of the increased sales of guns, ammo, and out doors equipment from the quarter ending October 1. The last quarter of 2020 saw an increase in the sales of guns and ammo across the board. It also saw more school sports increase as states start to re-open. So far this quarter, which will not be in the earnings report, we saw the third highest increase in gun sales. We also see Texas and other states that are big ASO earners completely re-open. \n\nGetting back to institutional shenanigans. Not only do you see the price fall below the $25 call weekly on low volume trades, despite running up the day or week before, but you can also see price suppression daily. Look at the average volume of Monday's 13% run up, and then look at the volume it took to drive it back down to $25 on Tuesday. If you look at the daily chart for the past month you will see a roller coaster ride of 1-3% ups and downs hourly. Each time I've seen something like this it was either institutions \"shaking out weak hands\" or GME's first pop. \n\nI understand that most are diamond handing GME and it may have room to run, but I believe that not only is ASO over-shorted and will have another stellar earnings driving the price higher causing a squeeze, but that it is a fundamentally undervalued company.\n\nI currently hold 20 April 16 $25c, and 5 April 16 $35.",

        "309":"Visualization of all open option contracts on GME \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 # What Motivates an Ape\n\nI've made this because apes don't have easy access to options data. While some broker platforms have pretty cutting edge tools for retail level investment, they're not clear or easy to use. So I wanted to share some data with my fellow apes that I think presents some good information in a clear and easy to understand way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Number of open option contracts for GME. Darker lines indicate more open contracts. Data scraped 3x daily.](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/i8a3d88nx0m61.png?width=1800&format=png&auto=webp&s=404ee42aa7ff8144e148da08e619e4321025b1fd)\n\n# Ok, so what am looking at?\n\nThis is a plot of all open option contracts on GME. For those not familiar, in the simplest possible terms, an option is a contract to either buy or sell 100 shares of a stock at a price that you chose (the **strike**), and at a date that you also choose (the **expiry**). An option that will allow you to *buy* 100 shares at your chosen price and future date is called a *call*. An option that allows you to *sell* 100 shares at your chosen price and future date is called a *put.*\n\nSince an option is a contract, two parties are required: 1.) The option seller\/writer, and 2.) the option buyer. For every contract, there has to be a buyer and seller. So when you buy a contract, you are literally buying the *option* to buy or sell 100 shares of a stock.\n\nOn the other side of the contract, someone had to sell it to you. They are therefore taking your money in exchange for *maybe* having to provide you with 100 shares of stock if the price of the stock moved in your favor. \n\nThe black lines\/boxes in the plot represent the number of contracts 'open'. This means two parties have agreed to buy\/sell an option contract between them at a given strike price and expiry date. If the contract is open, that means the buyer is still waiting on the stock price to move in their favor. If it doesn't move there before the expiry date, then the contract is worthless and the seller of the contract made money on the buyer. The dotted black line represents the price at time of writing. \n\n# So what does the data show then?\n\nIt shows a ton of contracts open at really extreme strike values. Right now there is a huge demand for GME contracts, so the price of *any* contract at *any* price is high. It appears that people are buying\/selling a ton of put contracts at very low strikes. \n\nThis means two things:\n\n1. The people buying these contracts believe GME will crash down to these low values. They could also be people with lots of stock buying them to offset the risk if it crashes before they expect.\n2. The people selling these contracts believe that even if the price of GME drops, it will never hit these low prices. Because all options are expensive right now, the sellers of these options stand to make a good profit if GME stays above $20. \n\n[Huge number of open put contracts below $20, expiring in mid April.](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/uy9h07dp41m61.png?width=1992&format=png&auto=webp&s=989a1b58ecf02ca8da5bead1d4ccb85d970328a9)\n\nThere are also some call options being bought sold at very high strikes, but nowhere near the volume of puts.

        "313":"$UWMC I'm reposting my original post with some more context regarding $UWMC.\n\nListen guys, don't just buy stocks because it's on WSB, do your own DD (Due Diligence) beforehand. With that being said, if you do your DD on UWMC, you'll see this stock is unique with a great future ahead of itself.\n\nPlease refer below:\n\n$UWMC - I truly like this stock.\n\nQuick degenerate outlook. Most recent quarterly earnings had a great earnings report. Y2019 to Y2020 great earnings report and increase\/growth overall.\n\nShort Interest - I see a lot of people talking about short interest and short float percentage and don't seem to quite understand it completely. If there's a short interest of %10 thats considered high. If there's a short interest of %20 or greater thats considered extremely high. When GME hit %140 short interest that was a rare event. With that aside, here are some current updates on the short percentages of UWMC, GME, AMC, RKT.\n\nUWMC - 28% as of 03\/03\/2021\n\nGME - 26% as of 03\/03\/2021\n\nAMC - 14% as of 03\/03\/2021\n\nRKT - 17% as of 03\/03\/2021\n\nSource: Fintel.io\n\n**Fair value analysis for $UWMC**\n\n>[Trading at 85.8% below our estimate of its fair value](https:\/\/simplywall.st\/stocks\/us\/banks\/nyse-uwmc\/uwm-holdings#intrinsic-value)  \n>  \n>[Earnings are forecast to grow ](https:\/\/simplywall.st\/stocks\/us\/banks\/nyse-uwmc\/uwm-holdings#future)[4.83% per year](https:\/\/simplywall.st\/stocks\/us\/banks\/nyse-uwmc\/uwm-holdings#future)  \n>  \n>[Earnings grew by 545.9% over the past year](https:\/\/simplywall.st\/stocks\/us\/banks\/nyse-uwmc\/uwm-holdings#past)  \n>  \n>Source: Simply Wall Street\n\nFair value of UWMC as per Simply Wall Street = $64.40 - Currently going for $10.00.\n\n\\*\\* This has been pointed out by u\/bbwasawesome that SWS has updated their fair value to $19.78. This makes sense as this stock is valued anywhere between $20-$60 in a normal market.\\*\\*\n\nUWMC is Americas leader in underwriting loans and mortgages. They have differentiated themselves from their competitors by having their business create the fastest and most effective consumer to lender process to be qualified\/approved for their mortgage application and be provided the best competitive rates.  UWMC doesn't \"Lend\" any funds, they are simply the facilitator and underwriter. What they provide institutions, lenders, and consumers is a simple process they can use to apply, compare, and complete a mortgage application. Their system and software is proprietary to UWMC and institutions such as small banks, credit unions, brokers, and lenders use it because it reduces time & cost on a multitude of spectrums and the process is much quicker; meaning closing applications faster equates to higher revenue for institutions and Lenders. The whole process is completed through UWMC from consumer to lender, and provides enormous benefit to both B2C and B2B.\n\nYou look me in the eye right now and tell me you have a hard time seeing this? \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc40\n\n$UWMC \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nMods please make this a serious thread.

        "314":"Did everyone forget about AMC? AMC has in my opinion officially decoupled from GME. I don't see as many posts, or as many comments regarding the DD or discussions on the potentials AMC poses as a short squeeze target. It's sad to see how many of you disbanded for quick bucks on other shit tickers. \n\nHere are some cold facts about AMC:\n\n1. AMC Short Interest is now a whopping +10%\n2. The OI on options expiring 3\/19 are ENORMOUS. The value is nearly HALF that of Apples.\n3. AMC is still a massively shorted stock, one of the most in the whole market. \n4. AMC is reopening dozens and dozens of cinemas tomorrow in many cities: one of the biggest being in San Francisco.\n5. The fucking FUNDAMENTALS haven't changed! AMC & GME have ALWAYS been the cause. We LIKE these stocks. \n\n>inb4 here are bearish hard cold facts on AMC.\n\nI just came back today from the cinema for the first time in a long ass time. And it felt GREAT. The feeling of having people laugh alongside you, the thrill of grabbing popcorn and sinking into the leather chairs, watching a new release on a big screen. Fuck the Netflix. That's for lazy zoomers who want instant depressing gratification. So fuck the bearish sentiment on AMC. I don't care. I support our cinemas with my cash, and will fucking HOLD until you apes eventually come back to your original mission. \n\nTLDR: Everyone seems to have forgotten about AMC to chase quick bucks on PLT, RKT, SKX and other shit tickers and have forgotten where they began. AMC is still not done. It never really began in the first place, yet. Stay the course.",
        "316":"Thoughts on VSTO? I know I know everyone is only into GME and AMC news so I'll gladly chew the downvotes here if I'm able to have a conversation with my fellow apes in the sporting goods market.\n\nLastest earnings showed they were up 35% last year, slaughtered the expected numbers. They control the majority of the ammo market in the middle of an ammo shortage, they acquired multiple failing ammo producers right in the middle of this as well. \n\nI think they are significantly undervalued and here's why; In this ammo shortage, when they're already earning quite well they announced that 04\/01\/21 the price of their ammo will increase 3-15%. They're currently scaling up production to meet demand to tackle the mountain of about 1 billion dollars in backlog. Did I mention that the ammo hoarders are THE least rational consumers on the planet? If a senator so much as suggests gun control or expanding background checks they go out and clean off store shelves. With the all blue admin we have now I think those folks are going to be as retarded as ever.\n\nToday being the Red Wedding day for everything in the market, (except for the champs in GME), VSTO dropped to $28. Now this significant because ZERO bad news came out of the company, in fact sales appear to be up higher lately too.\n\nI reaaaaally like this stock and bought up a bunch more shares today on the dip with 18.46 @$30.27 average. For those following the sporting goods industry what do y'all think, is there something here?\n\nEdit: Position or ban\nhttps:\/\/imgur.com\/gallery\/XkxfIjV\n\nEdit: Also looks like some positive news on the underlying numbers in their industry\n\nhttps:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/investors-undervaluing-vista-outdoor-vsto-165004269.html",

        "324":"It\u2019s time to talk about UWMC I\u2019m seeing this ticker get plugged a lot in the last 48hrs. Have I seen any quality DD? Not really. Have I seen any reputable accounts endorse it? Nope. Is the post history and discussion on these threads legit? It sure doesn\u2019t seem that way. \n\nI\u2019ve been a heavy lurker of WSB since the GME rise and this community has vibe. I\u2019m not an OG but have noted when og\u2019s post on what it used to be and I was here pre 2million and I\u2019ve watched closely (I live on refreshing new) how this sub has evolved over the last 2 months. \n\nUWMC started popping up so I checked it out and saw that a bottom could be nearing so I put in a tiny bit just to watch it (10@9.80). I then went back to dig for some real DD. Problem is, there is none. This has a P&amp;amp;amp;D feel and an ugly stench. I was bummed when RKT took off (without me on it and there was good DD on it) but the plummet got me hopeful that maybe some of the gains gets funneled into GME (I have a position). Which leads me back to UWMC.  It doesn\u2019t feel right. It doesn\u2019t look right. It doesn\u2019t seem right. \n\nIf UWMC is a hedge distraction, involving yourself only helps them. If you\u2019ve done your own DD and believe, awesome. I for one won\u2019t be tossing anything more at it. Good luck out there.\n\nMy original post was taken down and I\u2019m not sure why. I\u2019m not hip to all the rules. If the opening is any indication, I think it bolsters my theory. And to the folks that think I\u2019m GME focused. I am but wouldn\u2019t be sad if it drops to the 80s, that\u2019s called a fire sell and I love buying shit on sale.\n\nEdit: The main point of this post wasn\u2019t to be a conspiracy but to be weary of the hype. Do your own DD. If you like the stock then buy it. The whole you better get on board now crowd is sketch and was why I posted this in the first place. Make your money. Do what you like, I don\u2019t care either way. I wish everybody all the tendies.\n\nEdit 2: Check out user whiteytighties comment thread.

This is purely my opinion and these numbers have not been audited.**\n---\n**Round 2**: Ding, ding, ding. Here's my previous [analysis](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/lspbb5\/gme_dd_analysis_of_options_expiry_on_226_and\/)\n\n---\n\n**TL;DR**: The data indicates that squeezes could be on the way.\n\n---\n**Analysis**\n\nCurrently: Roughly $227m in value, or 11.6m shares, (call-put) are in the money. \n\n* At each $10 threshold up to $150\/share, approximately 1m shares come into the money at each increment. \n* At $160\/share, approximately 2m shares come into the money.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSince rate of delta change is the highest around each strike price (meaning gamma is also largest). It would lead me to believe that a ton of shares will need to be bought to hedge these positions as these share price amounts are passed (creating a sequence of gamma squeezes).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**If price were to squeeze up to $810\/share (~56b market cap): \n\n* The net calls in the money would exceed the float.** This is insane! Even if calls were covered on the way up by buying the underlying, it's not possible to cover more than 100% of float\n* 8m shares would come into the money creating a huge gamma squeeze\n* This in turn would create a massive short squeeze (even if current short reporting is accurate, which is somewhat questionable at this point, there are more net calls alone that need to be covered to exceed float, which means shorts would be squeezed not just because of the price, but also because of share lenders calling shares. P.S. - Not sure how this works, so would like to hear others weigh-in if they understand this better)\n* Really, hitting this price seems like it would create a squeeze of epic proportions\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs of 3\/3 close: (Call Value ITM - Put Value ITM) = **>$226m** | Call Shares ITM - Put Shares ITM = **>11.5m**\n\n---\n\n**Data**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHere's the call-put at various

        "335":"DD: ASO \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80GME fuel Hopefully you made money from the weed stock bump last month and RKT this week. The following is ASO DD and why it could take GME to the next level based on reinvesting gains. Academy Sports & Outdoors (ASO) beat last quarters earnings by 2.X times predictions. My thesis involves a run up to the Q4 earnings report March 31. Besides the company consistently outperforming market expectations it currently sits as the third most shorted stock (under GME and Tanger).\n\nSince the pandemic began gun and ammo sales have been going through the roof. You may think this would be a negative factor going forward as things calm down but January 2021 had the 3rd highest gun sales record in history. Ammo stocks have seen a boost but then a drop as they report they cannot keep up with supply.\n\nHunting, fishing, camping, kayaking and other outdoor hobbies have seen a huge increase since the pandemic began, this shit ain't over fokes and we know how much autists spend on new hobbies.\n\nTexas is \"opening back up\" and eliminating the mask mandate. Texas has almost 10% of the US population and they love guns, ammo and the outdoors. ASO is going to be absolutely packed. On top of that, they're all about to receive that sweet stimey money and it sure isn't going into investments. This will undoubtably create positive sentiment articles. \n\nSo this all sounds like a long term bull case right? Wrong. ASO has seen huge spikes in 2021, as have most of the most heavily shorted stocks. This one has the financials and positive momentum to keep it going. If it garners enough interest, as RKT did, a pop is bound to happen as people see the value.\n\nHow does this affect GME? Have you seen the posts of people reinvesting gains from RKT and weed stocks? This is the next stop on the road to the moon. P.S. I'm drunk on tendies so excuse misspellings, grammar and lack of charts.",
        "336":"The revival of ROCK HANDS Lurker just wanting to add a little to the discussion  (excuse not adopting the lingo, I don't post often).\n\n I'm no financial advisor so don't take my word and such, but I do remember before the GME craze there was a term called rock hands for the people who could stand a beating but still come out on top because their DD was sound. An example I can give to everyone now to understand, is say you bought into GME at 200, averaged down to 90 (when it hovered in the 40s for a week), then sold at 180 when it bounced back. I'd say that was a rock hand play. You came in high, averaged down, then still 2X your money, brovo. (I guess disclaimer, I hold GME and got in way before you). \n\nI know it's cool now to say paper hand this and paper hand that, but if you ain't making no money or losing a lot of money I'm not sure why you on a betting subreddit. Make big moves but not dumb moves. Not every hand is a diamond hand play, infact a diamond hand play is ultra rare. You gonna find a lot of 2x, 3x, 4x, 5x plays rather than the say 10X or more.....Or you might lose it all, who knows. But without a DD you really are a retard and more than likely bout to get your pockets ran. \n\nBut as I said im just a lurker, i'm not trying to sway anyone to buy or sell anything. I'm just reminiscing about the other forgotten hand. Make some money fellas, it's a lot of rock handed plays out there. But keep digging deep until you find that diamond hand play for sure.

Shares cheap as fuck rn. Primed for lift off. May get a lil cheaper first , so watch it a little b4 you buy. Ceo projected 20 billion dollars revenue 2022. Market cap is under 15. You do the math\n\n\nIm here to tell you all what play im currently holding 30 shares in and plan to double down on in the morming because the price is insanely good, and tbh may even get better in coming days from a buyers perspective. It is currently down 43% from its ath, only reached due tl INTERIM p3 results. \nLets start with the bad. \n\nIn 33 years theyve never reached full fda approval for anything. Close but no cigar every time. \n\nIt has held a steady slightly pessimist short interest of 10% for the entire time ive been invested, but in that time institutional ownership has climbed from 49% to about 88% now. I have strong reason to believe this short interest is now much larger. Please read on. \nWhen the nasdaq is down and theres no good news for the stock, it sinks. When theres mildly good news, the stock sinks. Shorts? Maybe.\n\nMany big money vaccines already approved. US market share likely holding mass inventory of big pharma and baby oil vaccines by the time FDA approves. This doesnt matter too much, the united states has a contract with nvax for 100 million doses at 16 a pop that they buy on fda approval, period.  The big pharma vaccines efficacys vs variants and transmission are laughable. The world is a  breeding ground for variants right now. A problem novavaxs platform will easily develop quadralent boosters for. \n\nHonestly, theres not a whole lot of bad imo. These bad things seems good to me. \nThe good.\nIts absurdly cheap right now, almost as cheap as before p3 interim data. This is because the ceo sucks at talking and people dont like the 1 to 2 month timeline he mentiomed on nbc yesterday for approvals. That same morning he told new york times \"he loves burning shorts\".\nLast week, boris johnson said novavax approval was coming soon. \nThe market price never reacted to the covax deal of 1.1 billion doses because we dont know the price yet, and shorts are trying to say the 3 dollars poor countries will pay is what nvax will get per dose. Thats not how donation and subsidization works. Nvax is getting way more than 3. At least 10. \nIts efficacy is first class, please look it up, the scientists online have already explained it better than i can. \nToday the price tanked , due to his interview yesterday RIGHT AFTER SAYING HE LOVES BURNING SHORTS. Yes he said fda is 2-3 months out.\nThey have rolling approvals in dozens of places happening! And their final phase 3 data can drop anytime!. The short interest has been 10% for a while and i just KNOW its higher now.\nInstitutional holdings hasnt dropped. The name novavax is appearing in the news more and more. Its happening this month. Idk how long shares will be near 200, i wouldnt be surprised if you can pick some up for 180 tomorrow. But theres a squeeze coming. Not like gme was, this isnt hundreds of percent short. Its in the teens. That will still be a nice spike to an already large biotech spike.\n\nB.riley eoy price target : 398. \nI think we see more than that. Weve already seen 330.\nThe news that propels us could happen any day. But dont leave gme. Im in there too. But if any of the squeezes your in do their thang, and nvax is still down, double check to make sure nothing bad happened with the stock and then bring those tendies over for more tendies!!!",

        "351":"Keep Your Eyes on the Volume Behind the Movement **The Key to Success has Been Underneath Your Nose the Entire Time**\n\nThe key detail that every new trader seems to miss is that volume ultimately controls price movements because the presence of adequate volume validates the price movement. If a price movement fails to be validated by adequate volume , then there is going to be an equal an opposite reaction. There exists a variable that satisfies both quantitative and fundamental analysts. That is the Volume Weighted Average Price ( VWAP ) and it is complemented by the Volume Weighted Moving Average ( VWMA ). When you do not consider the weight of volume in price movements, you are at the mercy of manipulative, high volume whales that seek to sink Simple Moving Averages ( SMAs ) during times of low volume in the interest of accumulation of the asset.\n\nVWAPs can be treated as the \"true\" price of an asset on any given resolution, but become less sensitive to change as you zoom out. These ever-shifting values can be treated as floors, in bullish times, and ceilings, during a bear market. You can always expect a \"bounce\" off of the VWAP in the opposite direction at least once as price attempts to cross over it. These resistance lines are useful to every audience, the soon-to-be long holders who would like to plan a decent entry, the short sellers trying to make a quick buck, and the swing traders who like to make money regardless of who controls the market. One should always keep in mind that price never strays too far from the VWAP before attempting to violently correct itself in the other direction.\n\nThere is a measure of movement around the VWAP , which we'll call volatility , and it masks the true price of the asset and its direction. By following the VWAP , you can see accurately whether the asset is going high or low. I'm using these customized bands to look for long entries (in the green or below) and short entries (in the red or above) to make short term profits to be accumulated in my spot balances. Ultimately, by building your position you can ensure a long-term profit but it doesn't mean too much if one simply never takes profit.\n\nLongs can be slept on. Shorts must be monitored. Set a budget, craft a plan, and stick to it. Remember to remove your principal investment at some point to reduce your risk.\n\nIn a bull market, buy at the monthly VWAP (Purple Line) and in a bear market, sell there.\n\nHappy Hunting!- Patch Hemlock\n\n[https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/chart\/GME\/ApPTU3cw-Keep-Your-Eyes-on-the-Volume-Behind-the-Movement\/](https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/chart\/GME\/ApPTU3cw-Keep-Your-Eyes-on-the-Volume-Behind-the-Movement\/)\n\nProof of Institutional Use of VWAP: WATCH LIVE: GameStop hearing: Robinhood, Citadel and Reddit CEOs testify \u2014 2\/18\/21 by CNBC Television on YouTube (Timestamp 4:55:34)\n\nEDIT: For any would-be quants out there, I've developed an open-source pine script to act as a springboard for you\n\n[https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/script\/kJqBZ6s8-Realtime-All-Time-High-and-All-Time-Low-Tracker-WIP\/](https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/script\/kJqBZ6s8-Realtime-All-Time-High-and-All-Time-Low-Tracker-WIP\/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReposted due to automoderation of youtube links\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDECLARATION OF BIAS:\n\npurchased GME at $13 and AMC at $4\n\ndoubled down after the crash at $50 and $6 respectively\n\nnever sold",

        "358":"(GME DD) Why the Volkswagen Comparison is much more inaccurate than you thought, but in A DIFFERENT WAY Hey folks!\nI\u2019m not exactly one to do too much digging through numbers, but over the last few days I\u2019ve just thought of something using what seems to me to be a fairly simple and watertight explanation for why those constant VW comparisons we\u2019ve finally started to escape from may not have been overplaying GME performance, but actually UNDERPLAYING it.\n\nApologies for the lack of rockets, but I\u2019m not writing this on a phone. Have fun with all the text:\n\nSo. The VW short squeeze spent a lot of time pretending to be a model for GME, with many trying to compare two very different graphs to predict future performance. There seemed to be a very common response to these VW shills, which was often along the lines of: \u201cwell, yeah there are more GME shares shorted than there were VW shares, but since the effective GME float is (whether made of original or duplicate counterfeit shares [again, reference the wonderful document which was shared around our community some weeks ago]) significantly larger than the 1% or so of VW shares there was, in effect the 13% short interest on VW led to a 13:1 short:float ratio meanwhile GME would, by nature of its much larger float, have a smaller ratio despite the fact it has far, far greater short interest (math 101).\nI accepted this for the last few weeks, but recently after trying to explain this to my mother through an actual example I came up with a very interesting differentiating factor which no one has really mentioned:\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR:\nYou can cover INFINITE short positions with ONE real share, as long as you make an infinite number of transactions, but you can only cover ONE naked short position with the ONE created counterfeit share.\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s explain that for those that don\u2019t immediately get the logic.\nImagine you are a hedge fund who shorted VW. Presumably, the vast majority if not ALL of the shorts executed went the following way:\n\nyou start with ~0~ shares\nyou borrow one from a broker\nyou now have ~1~ shares\nyou sell that share, completing your short\nyou now have ~0~ shares\n\nNow imagine the short squeeze happens.\nAnd let\u2019s say there are 100 people like you who all shorted one real share each. The thing is, you can buy a share off the market, returning your total to ~1~ shares, before you return it to ~0~ shares by giving it to your broker. Your broker can now sell that share to other shorts, and they to other shorts, etc.\nThe point being, when working with real shares, an infinite number of transactions can theoretically clear an infinite number of shorts (while still driving the price up).\n\nNow here\u2019s the kicker, which has been tormenting me over the last few days as I try not to get my hopes too high:\nImagine you are an immensely idiotic hedge fund, named Delvin Capital. \nYou go ahead and do some sexy naked shorting.\n\nyou start with ~0~ shares\nyou DO NOT BORROW ONE from your broker!\nyou sell a \u201cshare\u201d, promising to fulfill the step you just skipped \u201csometime soonish maybe\u201d\nyou now have ~ -1 ~ shares!!\n\nNow the squeeze happens, as above. But this time, the 100 other friends of yours are similarly positioned, and also made naked short positions. Notice the problem when you try to cover using the above strategy: you buy that one share off the market to cover your short. Notice: your total is not positive, but only ~0~, since you were actually negative to begin with! \nThus, you can\u2019t give these shares to your broker, or another fund, since doing so would only return you to a negative value: \n\nTHE POINT BEING, naked shorts, unlike normal PG-13 shorts, have what is effectively a 1:1 COVER RATIO\nThe whole idea of hedgies rapidly trading shares back and forth with each other to cover is, as far as I can reason, IMPOSSIBLE. Maybe that\u2019s why they haven\u2019t squeezed yet?\n\nHere\u2019s where VW vs. GME comes back in, though. GME\u2019s nominal institutional ownership is over 100%. Furthermore, with all the recently unearthed ETF shorts added in, GME shorts are pretty obviously over 100%. When you consider that, with retail NOT EVEN FACTORED INTO THE EQUATION, this 1:1 cover ratio is completely in feasible for shorts, their desperation seems to have been, if anything, undervalued this whole time. The ONLY WAY THEY CAN COVER NAKED SHORTS is buy repurchasing an almost IDENTICAL NUMBER OF SHARES, and it is THIS FACT that they are not just able to purchase a few shares and move them around like they might otherwise have been able to but would literally have to buy more shares than exist *WITHOUT TRADING THE SAME ONES BACK AND FORTH* which makes this fucking crazy.\nAssuming retail and bullish institutions hold, it is not just exceedingly costly, but impossible for them to cover.\n\n\nIf you\u2019ve gotten this far, congratulations.\nNow think about that again.\n\n\nEffective TL;DR 2.0:\n\nPeople asked what the price would be like if demand is infinite and supply minuscule?\nProbably pretty fucking high. VW may be a good example.\n\nBut here\u2019s MY question:\nWhat will the price be like if demand is infinite and it is literally impossible for supply to ever meet it? \nVW is definitely not a good example. If anything, it\u2019s an understatement. I think THIS is what actually makes GME something we\u2019ve never, ever seen before in all of financial history.\n\n\nPlease reflect on this and correct me if I\u2019m wrong. I hope I\u2019m not.\nJoy to all,\n~Unimportant\n\n\n(this is not financial advise, and I am not a financial advisor)",
        "359":"Dear Apes, why was Rocket\u2019s dividend strategy genius? I\u2019ll try to dumb it down for you fuck tards. Happy Saturday Tards. Oh and a heart-felt go fuck yourself to the WSB mods! Ban me again you cunts, I don\u2019t care \ud83e\udd70\n\nApes, lmk if I am missing anything with this thesis:\n\nWhen I first heard RKT was doing a dividend I was pissed - no true growth companies pay out dividends. It\u2019s for boomer companies like XOM or CVX. But this one-time special dividend  is VASTLY different. Why? Well strap on your helmet and kneebow pads and I\u2019ll tell you fece-tossing apes.\n\nRKT insiders own 95% of $RKT shares. So 95% of the dividend payout is going to Rocket insiders (75% of which is owned by Dan Gilbert, the reincarnation of King Haramabe himself). \n\n$RKT insiders are literally paying themselves; they can use the cash they pay themselves to buy-back stock while forcing shorts to pay a dividend and enticing investors to buy in simultaneously. If you tree-swinging Orangutans didn\u2019t already know, Rocket attempted to deter shorts during November\u2019s earnings call by adding a $1 billion dollar buy back. \n\nIt didn\u2019t work. Shorts only continued to pile in, but here\u2019s the thing. Rocket hasn\u2019t used a PENNY of that buyback. They are still fully loaded with ammunition to fuck over the shorts with a billion dollars to buy back shares.  $1B buyback is OVER HALF OF THEIR PUBLIC FLOAT. \n\n**Shorts have to pay the dividend?**\n\nYes. If a stock in which you currently have a short position pays a dividend, you are responsible for the dividend on the shares you have borrowed. When the dividend is due, your broker will withdraw cash from your brokerage account equal to the amount of the dividend paid on the shorted shares.\n\n\n**BuT iF RkT Is So UnDeRvALuEd, WhY HaVeN\u2019T tHeY BoUgHt BaCk AnY ShArEs ?**\n\nGREAT QUESTION my jello-brained friend, now wipe the drool off the side of your mouth and I\u2019ll tell you. \n\nThe reason Rocket hasn\u2019t bought back any shares is because, companies are unable to exercise a buy back if they are holding non-public, material information(their new partnership with Etrade and Morgan Stanley AND the special dividend announcement). I assumed before the ER that they hadn\u2019t bought back any shares for this reason and still believe it to be true. Now that the partner and dividend announcement is behind them, the $RKT can fire at will and is clear for take off \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nRocket insiders will receive $2B from the special dividend which is more than enough to cover the buy back plan they announced back in November. \n\nInitially, I wanted an increase in the amount of buy back but then I realized that the special dividend may be one of the smartest moves they could make. This move is very calculated - it may complement their buy back strategy tremendously, force shorts to pay more money on top of the 80% interest they are paying to borrow shares, and also motivate retards like you to ditch GME and buy a real winner. Not to mention Rocket was already a popular stock among option traders but its share volume was low. This FAT dividend will motivate more investors to choose shares rather than options, which will help increase our chances of a breakout on volume. \n\n**BuT YoU CaNt SqUeEzE a 40 BiLlIoN DoLlAR CoMpAnY:**\n\nDon\u2019t focus on the size of the company. Focus on the size of their public float. Which makes them a FUBO sized company in a sense, and they are a company that is actually sustainable and will continue growing. We all know how GameStop\u2019s ending will be written. Patient GME shorts will end up making money because GME will eventually fall back to its worth\/value. But Rocket is different. When Rocket hits the $30s, it will never see the $20s again. There is nothing for shorts to \u201cwait out\u201d on this play. I\u2019m not gay, but I am down to fuck some shorts in the ass, now who\u2019s with me?\n\n\n\nTLDR: dividend and buy back plan = more \ud83d\udcb4 for more \ud83e\udd8d. More \ud83d\udcb0 = more \ud83c\udf4c. Apes likey bananas \ud83c\udf4c\n\n\nEdit: if RKT hits $30, 5k will be donated to special Olympics. 10k if it hits $40.

I often wonder if u\/TheRoaringKitty has secretly cashed in his tendies and escaped all this madness, but then I remember he's not a paper handed b\\*tch, as I'm sure all of you aren't either. Either way, the GME saga could be coming to a massive close in the form of one last big move. Having briefly just broken below the 200 day simple moving average yesterday and bouncing back well, a break to the upside could make everything right in the world once again and bring GME back near 300 territory. A break and hold below the 200 MA is a possible sign of more downside to come. I have to admit the risk to reward here is juicy and am looking to fire up a few 200C  Jan 2022 and will add more upon confirmation of a breakout  of this massive triangle to 300 and beyond. Green line I have there is around 250 where it may be wise to take profits as the hedgies will try to short ladder attack as the perevious resistance of 240ish is broken. Oh yeah and the yellow line is beginning of 2022 so if we don't get a move by then we're prob fucked imo.\n\nGME TLDR: hold 200 MA, breakout top of triangle, then moon.\n\n[Another Triangle Thingy but Not Quite as Big](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/d28ufb91yvv71.jpg?width=1829&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dc047671ee092bccd4412db8eeb2a0c5ee12c3bb)\n\nAnd now for the second meme that has become many apes meme stonk of choice. This guy has been coiling for a while since the absolute monster rip and like GME could be primed for another move. Sitting at the bottom of our nicely developing trendline, this is another great risk to reward opportunity. 50 would be a take profit zone as the shorts will look to hold it down there at previous resistance but hey, we know you apes aren't selling for that cheap. Red line could be a stop loss for those of you with wrinklier brains at about 32. 200 MA is catching up but not really a factor like GME. Break of 50 MA could easily fuel us to break the wedge and then to 50 and beyond.\n\nAMC TLDR: hold lower trendline, break top of triangle, then moon\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Different Triangle Thingy Already Broken to Upside](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/16y3bd712wv71.jpg?width=1833&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b3aa8314e63d9eac4c37e89f296758ce13e1c98a)\n\nDon't think I forgot about the meme stonk little brother, BB. This was to many not nearly on the same level as GME or AMC, but my how the tables have turned. This meme has actually gotten a LOT of good news (not going to include here but check it out) and many consider it to be more a fundamental play than meme at this point. But don't let them fool you, BB will be there aboard the rocket ship too when Round 3 begins. Already broke our wedge with nice volume a few days ago and has pulled back nicely to the 200 MA. Hold of this and a break above that blue dotted line near 12.25 should get us back to 15+ in no time.\n\nTLDR: Hold 200 MA, break 12.25, then moon.\n\nThese are just the big 3 I've seen upside in, but I'm sure there's many more memes to be had.

Need I say anything?\nIf the cult is to be believed, TSLA will have 3 trillion in robotaxi, solar energy and other revenues within 2025 or something. \n(I am not saying you shouldn\u2019t buy TSLA, my whole post is about showing the power of cult)\n\nAs long as there is a cult which has buying power and buys the product+stock, the stock would reward one handsomely.\n\nWith all that prologue, I have recently started browsing some online discussion circles, and I think DWAC is a similar big cult in the making. They have a huge portion of the populace by the balls as potential customers and regardless of what their product is, if the cult has staying power (which I believe it does), the product would hardly matter.\n\nTL;DR: Invest in cult. Invest in DWAC and other similar cults.\n\n\nEdit: I haven't mentioned some cults as I don't wanna get banned(cry ptos, tell me what value they actually produce), other cults could include companies like LULU or Yeti. And my original intention was to see some other tickers that have similar cult vibes, looks like the discussion just became too focused on a single ticker.",
        "723":"ENVX Battery Tech Spec Play? Alright tards,\n\nI've been on a bit of a hiatus from this sub. It's taken me a while to see a reason to return and not just lurk but I have stumbled upon a seemingly credible reason to return and talk about some other stocks other than my beloved GME, AMC, BB, PLTR, etc. \n\nSo I was watching Meet Kevin interview Marc Cohodes yesterday, https:\/\/youtu.be\/3MDW6x6nJTE , and at the end Kevin asks him about some of the names he is into and Marc responds with a good discussion about battery tech, highly recommend giving a listen, and the company he is invested in that is in this space, Enovix(ENVX). I started doing my own research on this company and stumbled upon a battery day video from a few months back, https:\/\/youtu.be\/r8mvMeaa3t0 , in which the CEO, Harrold Rust, is discussing what his company does and why they are poised to DOMINATE! Highly recommend giving this a listen to as well. I am extremely bullish on this stock and would love to see a discussion start around them. They went public via SPAC months ago and have a primary focus of raising capital. The founders, CEO included, are all buddies who worked at IBM back in the day and I think this could be a game changer! Cohodes also pointed out that battery tech and the industry, especially utilizing high amounts of silicon, could become a national security issue with all that is going on in the broader market right now. Something to think about. Need some Apes to get that capital formation going and this bitch will fly!\n\nTL;DR Enovix(ENVX) is poised to DOMINATE the future of battery. They have made leaps in the area of architecture and due to this, they are able to accomplish battery performance that absolutely fucks current leaders in the pooper. CEO says they are aimed at raising capital and once they have that, they can begin to really show their balls.\n\n\nEdit 1: Options look poised to cause SERIOUS gamma ramp with $30 strike price being the highest for the shortest term contracts(19 November) and a history of being able to jump that much in price in less time than a month. Current price is around $22. This could be a play that yields SERIOUS returns. Capital formation gets to a point that the company can start making moves and this thing is going to RUNNNNN \ud83d\ude80",

        "725":"GME report: Seeming conflict between figure 5 and figure 6. Thoughts? Disclaimer: This is not dd. This is opening a discussion for a certain factor of the gme report that is causing controversy\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: the data in figure 6 does NOT include all the shorts. It is merely a representative sample of shorts. Looking at the absolute quantity of shorts buying here is meaningless. However, given that it still seems odd to me that in the period between Feb 6th and Feb 12th, a massive quantity of shorts (something like 100% of the float) must have been covered according to this graph without any noticeable effect on price. Comments are disappearing for me for some reason and I am going to sleep. Play nice and stop downvoting comments posing resolutions other than higher than reported short interest into the ground. This is a discussion thread. Not a GME circle jerk thread. We are working through this report together to make sense of it and the purpose of this thread is to find clarity on something that seemed off to me and a bunch of other individuals not to just try to hype.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is a lot of speculation about whether the GME report suggests that shorts have not closed. The core of this comes down to the seeming disparity between this figure 5 and figure 6 of the report.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/x2pvs79nfdu71.png?width=645&format=png&auto=webp&s=acd07db860fbef8fa7ca174479e2292812df46b3\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ssomo32zfdu71.png?width=618&format=png&auto=webp&s=24fd26f5e629a2e944ecac2ae22c4a937b1263b9\n\n~~The figure 5 graph suggests that short interest fell by as much a 30% pre-new year  which corresponds to a necessary buy volume of 21 million shares. Yet, when we look at figure 6, the cumulative buy volume by short-sellers doesn't seem to come close.~~ (I'm retarded and don't know my months apparently) Additionally, by feb 12 the short interest was reported around 30% (according to marketbeat) which translates to an almost 100% drop in si. A drop that big would require an average short buy volume of 4.4 million per day (70 mil\/16 days). Yet figure 6 shows data not even close to that figure. This would imply extremely high levels of covering between febuary 5th and febuary 12th which doesn't seem reflected in the price action over that period.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat do the 'apes' say: Many individuals who are bullish on gme believe that this is evidence that the short interest data being reported is faulty in some manner. They believe that the low penalties for misrepresenting short interest are causing short hedge funds to underreport their positions. We all know that the short interest heavily affects the price movement of GameStop so this has some plausibility. Others suggest that the positions are being hidden through ftds or option tomfoolery. This is potentially less plausible because the reports specifically talks about ftds and it seems like they would have mentioned options if they could hide shorts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat do the gay bears say: Many gay bears have generally responded by arguing that the 'apes' are seeing largely what they want to see. The report clearly states that the shorts covered and that the short interest is low (relatively speaking). Why would the SEC do something convoluted like make conflicting graphs? 'Apes' are being conspiratorial and are interpreting it wrong if they are getting such a bizarre result.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat are your interpretations of this data? I want to move the dialogue from unhelpful comment fights to here. (Any math I do is meant to be generally illustrative not 100% accurate)\n\nEdit: Yeah the graphs are not in the same time period, but still looking at them and given that nearly the entire float was closed between jan 27 and feb 12. Figure 6 is still odd-looking.\n\nEdit 2: Figure 6 is a bit misleading because of the size of the candles. Keep in mind while viewing that there was a huge amount of volume during this period in the realm of 100 mil a day. Still significant, but that does mean it is less than one would first think. Additionally, in the notes it makes clear that this is not all the short buy volume just those from big players. Thanks to u\/StonkGodCapital for raising that point. However, I would say that I still think it is odd that the report implies that so much covering (of almost an entire float worth of covering) occurred during the pre-February 12th, but post squeeze period despite us seeing very boring price movement in that period.",
        "726":"CCL: The Last Reopening Play (Disclaimer, I'm long CCL with a combination of long calls and long shares. I am short a few covered calls with CCL shares of collateral too as a risk-management tool.)\n\nLots of my friends are apes, and I love that this subreddit has made them rich, so this is my attempt at giving back and making apes rich. I'm more of a Warren Buffett style investor, and I'm kinda anti social media so I have never posted here or even on Reddit. But CCL is an opportunity all investors should love, apes, speculators, and value investors alike.\n\nCCL is the last reopening play still trading at a 50% discount from it's pre-COVID peaks. This price is not justified: it is as undervalued as GME or AMC.\n\nRight now it\u2019s fallen to a support of 23 a share. Looking at the last times CCL fell to a support of 23 should show you the market is overlooking a big play.\n\nLast time we were at 23 was only September 18th 2021, and since then CCL has announced they are fully booked through 2023, and they\u2019ve refinanced a lot of high rate debt they put on earlier in the pandemic thus ending their liquidity crisis and giving them the cash on hand to expand their fleet further. Delta and United\u2019s earnings last week shows that travel stocks have recovered, or will soon recover. Merck's antiviral will further boost reopening plays. Americans have a well documented cash glut that will translate into luxury sales, like a cruise ship vacay. Even Morningstar, fucking Morningstar, agrees that 23 is a low price\u2013though their fair price of 27 still feels pretty low. \n\nIn fact, CCL is down from its recent high of 26 in September, down from 30 where it stood before the Delta variant stunted a number of reopening plays, and down from 60 where it was before the pandemic.\n\nHow can this be? Oh, because like GME and AMC it's a popular short target. The put to call ratio is 1.2. Definitely not as dramatic as AMC or GME was, but buying and holding will make a few hedgies cry.\n\nBecause the hedgies are so obviously fucking wrong on this. For 23 bucks, I am going to hold CCL and never let go, because owning a company with orders booked through 2023 and at half the price it was in 2019 is pretty fucking rad.\n\nIf you could see the deep fucking value in AMC and GME, you can see that CCL's value is as rich as the deep blue sea. I'm hodling, feel free to get rich with me.\n\nLinks:\n\nHedge Funds are Dumping CCL (lol this article was published while I was writing this post): [https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/hedge-funds-dumping-carnival-corporation-152552278.html](https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/hedge-funds-dumping-carnival-corporation-152552278.html)\n\nCarnival Corporation (CCL) Announces More U.S. Homeport Ship Restarts for January and February 2022:\n\n[https:\/\/www.investorsobserver.com\/news\/stock-update\/carnival-corporation-ccl-announces-more-u-s-homeport-ship-restarts-for-january-and-february-2022](https:\/\/www.investorsobserver.com\/news\/stock-update\/carnival-corporation-ccl-announces-more-u-s-homeport-ship-restarts-for-january-and-february-2022)\n\nCarnival Corporation: Liquidity Crisis Averted\n\n[https:\/\/seekingalpha.com\/article\/4459615-carnival-corporation-stock-liquidity-crisis-averted](https:\/\/seekingalpha.com\/article\/4459615-carnival-corporation-stock-liquidity-crisis-averted)",

        "738":"GameStops Actual Turnaround Strategy Case Study (Amazon\/MBA) **TLDR**\n\nHow does GameStop justify it's valuation of over $10B in market cap, while threats to it's core business accelerate? Console manufacturers are moving to digital delivery instead of physical games (38% of GME revenue). Meanwhile physical consoles, which make up over 49% of GME revenue, is only sold on 4 year cycles--and sold at all competing retailers.\n\nCreate a GME coin that consoles can mine, while powered on and connected to the internet. Users then spend GME Coins online to buy games, in-game items, and cosmetics--competing with Free to Play (F2P) market while supporting game publishers. GME sells the mining processing power to host games and CDNs, turning GME into a technology company.\n\n**Context**\n\nYou are tasked with drafting the turnaround strategy for GameStop, an online and brick-and-mortar retail store specializing in console games and accessories. The chairman for the board, Ryan Cohen, began his turnaround of the business in 2020, aiming to make GameStop the \u201cAmazon of Gaming\u201d. Recent \u201cMeme Stock\u201d speculation of the company's stock has driven the price of shares from $15 to as high as $483 in less than a year. As of September 20, 2021 the stock now trades at $189 per share.\n\n**Assumptions**\n\nGameStop has full alignment with Microsoft (Xbox) and Sony (Playstation) to build the \u201cnext generation\u201d of gaming. In the wake of the Epic vs. Apple lawsuit, Microsoft and Sony have determined that retailers such as GameStop are necessary and, for fear of antitrust regulations, have committed to a strong collaboration with GameStop. You have counterparts at both companies working to launch this new product offering. Ryan Cohen is interested in a serious turnaround strategy, to help justify the recent $10 Billion Dollar valuation by share price.\n\n**Challenges to the GameStop business model**\n\nDuring the Covid-19 pandemic, online retailers, digital game platforms, and online services grew the most due to the \u201cstay at home\u201d nature of pandemic restrictions. These companies saw increased revenue, online users, and engagement ([source](https:\/\/www.barrons.com\/articles\/stay-at-home-stocks-have-been-crushed-here-are-ones-that-could-still-win-long-term-51621036411)). GameStop\u2019s second quarter earnings of $1.18 Billion dollars of sales, yet reported an operating loss of $.76 per share. GameStop revenue came from 49.7% Hardware and Accessories (Consoles, controllers, adapters, etc), 38.9% Software (used and new video games), and 11.4% Collectibles (figurines, magazines, etc).\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/gvp45w5h5eq71.png?width=994&format=png&auto=webp&s=80a189cc248d650230faa1e85252dd4d1892ac01\n\nThe major consoles that contributed to GameStops revenue were the Playstation 5 and Xbox Series One. In the recent Epic vs. Apple lawsuit, when asked how much margin Microsoft makes on the Xbox consoles, the head of Xbox business development stated, \u201cWe don\u2019t; we sell the consoles at a loss\u201d. This is because the console market is a \u201chardware subsidy model, where game companies sell the consoles at a loss to attract new customers. Profits are then generated from game sales and online service subscriptions ([source](https:\/\/www.news18.com\/news\/tech\/microsoft-sells-xbox-consoles-for-a-loss-but-the-xbox-gaming-business-makes-money-3715331.html)).\n\nEach major game console manufacturer creates new consoles every four years on average, which creates growth challenges to GameStop in interim years between releases. An additional challenge to GameStop\u2019s future revenue is that each manufacturer operates online digital stores for instant purchasing of games, which is quicker to play than even Amazon can ship. It is estimated that around 50% of console and PC game sales are now being made through an online purchase. Adding insult to injury, both Microsoft and Playstation offer consoles without digital disc drives, requiring digital purchases to operate.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/8oinqe1n5eq71.png?width=930&format=png&auto=webp&s=87642bdceb199637d685574151f7187bf5ea600a\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/6jnphvuu5eq71.png?width=1008&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ad77c6d92c331c85b1655ae05228eb2b48a1830\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/43jwbbdw5eq71.png?width=880&format=png&auto=webp&s=15ddee48f6f1a306a14190f9295d409eb7071736\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/mc7nzn646eq71.png?width=1076&format=png&auto=webp&s=5211fe1ededf644821da80b6b1e473908cfbb742\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/gcbxjbi66eq71.png?width=920&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad8e767f4b5cc2e6659acbcf0f50fc610da1f6e1\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/xjld30ob6eq71.png?width=1010&format=png&auto=webp&s=e31d223ab51937b2727af8eec83fbc268e5c6654\n\n**Analysis**\n\nGameStops customers are increasingly purchasing digital copies of games directly from Microsoft, Playstation, or Nintendo, instead of physical copies from brick and mortar stores. It\u2019s estimated that 50% of sales are now digital, and growing.\n\n1. GameStop could work with publishers directly to offer subscription models for new games, exclusive content, or digital expansions, fronting the development costs by capitalizing their market share.\n2. GameStop could try to become the \u201cAmazon of Gaming\u201d by increasing their fulfillment and logistics chains to deliver physical copies of games and hardware quicker to customers, competing for market share of fixed price products.\n3. GameStop could broaden their hardware offerings to include Gaming PC\u2019s, laptops, and other hardware accessories, transitioning into more of a Best Buy ($29 Billion Valuation).\n4. GameStop could utilize their 4,000+ Brick and Mortar stores to perform services such as computer repair, and specialty services.\n5. Leverage GameStop\u2019s brand halo to create experiential events focused around their favorite games with exclusive \u201cdrops\u201d and releases.\n\nSWOT Matrix (Figure 1) and Porters 5 Forces (Figure 2), show that there are increasing threats to the GameStop retailer business model, not only from traditional competitors (Best Buy, Walmart), but also from online retailers such as Amazon and direct-to-consumer marketplaces (Xbox, Playstation, Nintendo Stores). The PEST analysis (Figure 4) shows that marketplaces have a unique sensitivity in today's legal atmosphere that can be utilized to negotiate with Console Manufacturers. Marketing Mix (Figure 5) shows that GameStop does not have a unique marketing position or product offering to leverage. Amazon fuels it\u2019s growth from nascent businesses by utilizing it\u2019s profits from Cloud (AWS) while operating at scale to decrease costs while increasing selection. Amazon even created its own last mile delivery and transport hubs to reduce costs and compete with FedEx and UPS. It\u2019s not feasible for GameStop to do so.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ao50evpe6eq71.png?width=442&format=png&auto=webp&s=578b562722fbbb7379be64c25ae2c2685bc8c457\n\nIn analyzing the current market, positioning of GameStop, and threats to the business, GameStop\u2019s future is not certain. GameStop risks following in [RadioShack](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/articles\/investing\/081315\/5-reasons-why-radioshack-went-out-business.asp) or Circuit City\u2019s footsteps.\n\n**Recommendation**\n\nGameStop should continue to leverage its sales of Console hardware, accessories, physical games, and used games\/trade-ins for the near term. Instead of redeveloping their supply, logistics, and fulfillment chains to maximize delivery speed, GameStop should leverage it\u2019s existing relationships with manufacturers and game publishers to receive inventory of releases early, and ship with promised delivery with UPS\/Fedex. This allows low cost shipping options to be utilized without expensive logistic routes. Fervent fans can still receive their games or consoles on Day 1, but without the upfront [CAPEX costs](https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2021\/08\/24\/walmart-launches-delivery-business-to-connect-other-local-retailers-with-consumers.html) to GameStop.\n\nUltimately, Judo Strategy (Figure 6) suggests GameStop must find ways to use their opponents' weight and strength against them, rather than emulating what their competitors are already doing well. Drastic steps need to be taken to compete against existing and future incumbents. To increase high-value engagements with GameStop that correlate to retention (eg \u201cStickiness\u201d), GameStop should create a digital wallet that allows customers to collect \u201ccoins\u201d that they can spend to purchase new games, cosmetics, or in-game purchases.\n\nUtilizing GameStops close relationship with Microsoft and Sony, GameStop should create a console app that performs hosting functions (mining) while connected to the internet. Porters 5 forces (Figure 2) shows that these consoles have expensive GPUs that can perform significant processing functions for centralized servers. [Many server farms today](https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/take-a-look-inside-an-underground-crypto-farm-busted-by-ukraine-police-2021-7) mine cryptocurrencies with consoles due to these strong GPUs.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/h6vrukth6eq71.png?width=902&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf918fc5d54a68f15a009e9df526842e63b9032e\n\nGameStop customers can then load this application and earn coins for every hour of hosting functions they perform for the collective platform. The hosting services could enable decentralized hosting of online video games and GameStops own e-commerce website. If a customer leaves the app on, performing hosting functions for the decentralized server for one hour, they would earn 1 credit. A new video game release may cost 1,000 credits, in-game cosmetics 500 credits. Credits could also be purchased directly from GameStop instead of mining. This would enable game publishers to create additional mirrors of their games online to prevent ever [increasing DDOS hacks](https:\/\/www.pcgamer.com\/apex-legends-hacked-to-protest-titanfalls-server-situation\/) which cost publishers millions while frustrating customers. This JUDO strategy allows GameStop to shift and compete in a whole new way, while the industry cuts out middlemen with Free-To-Play, digital downloads, and in-app purchases.\n\n**Measuring Success**\n\nEach customer's wallet would be tied to their GameStop account. This customer data would be aggregated to identify unique users. Aged GameStop accounts could be renewed and tied to new wallets. Mining\/hosting, spending coins, purchasing coins, and browsing the coin marketplace would be high value engagements (HVEs). As the gaming industry shifts completely to digital games, which could occur as soon as four years from now, GameStop can leverage this hosting strategy to grow revenue directly for game publishers, while competing with \u201cFree to Play\u201d games. This enables game publishers to continue to create high budget games, without charging exorbitant prices to customers ([which data shows customers are resistant to pay](https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/01\/18\/free-to-play-games-rule-the-entertainment-world-with-88-billion-in-revenue\/)).\n\n**Implementation**\n\nYou would work with the new Sr. Platform Manager of Xbox and Playstation (see assumptions section above), to select three pilot game publishers for this launch. They may include Epic Games (Apex Legends) and Activision (Call of Duty), among others.\n\nThe initial MVP would comprise the following headcount:\n\n1. Two Engineers (Xbox and Playstation App Development)\n2. Four Engineers (Mining\/Hosting experts with Content Delivery Network Experience)\n3. One Engineer (Ledger system to calculate payouts, spending, etc)\n4. Three Engineers (Flex, QA)\n5. Four Game Advocates (Work directly with the pilot Game publishers)\n6. One Marketing Specialists (Work directly with PR for news release on launch day)\n7. One Engineer (Coin Spending Storefront)\n\nAfter MVP development, the idea could be iterated on to improve hosting utilization and even sell spare hosting to the general web hosting marketplace. This would include cloud content delivery networks similar to Cloud Flare ($38 Billion Valuation).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Would you leave your console on to mine game coins?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Important Note: I have no holdings in GME or interest in the company.

Everyone knows the importance of reputation for a company. Highly reputable brands have multiple things going for them:\n\n* Their customers are extremely loyal and drive recurring purchases\n* The public is vocal about recommending their brand and products\n* Easier to expand to other markets as their reputation precedes them\n\nBasically, you can consider having a great reputation to be a positive feedback loop on steroids! In an economy where 70-80% of the market value of a company comes from intangible assets like brand equity, intellectual capital, and goodwill \\[2\\], reputations can make or break a company\u2019s performance.\n\nIn one of my previous analyses, we had discovered and proved that the [best companies to work for routinely beat the market in stock returns](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/ok4l9c\/i_analyzed_the_performance_of_companies_in_the\/). So this week, let\u2019s see how the most reputed brands have performed over the last decade!\n\n[ ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/e1y8b3xtp8q71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=050451ab56c0dd05014ff5207231fc40766dadcf)\n\n**Data**\n\nWhile there are multiple companies that measure reputation, I chose the [RepTrack](https:\/\/www.reptrak.com\/) list for my analysis as they seem to be the most established ones and have been creating their top 100 list for the last 2 decades.\n\nThey base their study on more than 240K responders over 15+ countries and the rating tells us how the companies are regarded by the general public. They have multiple factors that go into the final ranking, but for this analysis, I am only considering the final rank of the company.\n\nI am considering the companies that were present in the Top 10 list at least once in the last decade \\[2012 - 2021\\]\n\n[ ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/w05hhrxtp8q71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=5827fd247cb15d12bd50ac6746134c6bb6dac330)\n\n**Analysis**\n\nRepTrack publishes their result in March, every year. Since I could not find any fixed date of publication, for the purpose of the stock price calculation, I am using April 1st of every year as my investment date.\n\nEven though the company produces a Top 100 list, I have limited my analysis to the Top 10 companies \\[3\\]. We then calculate the stock returns generated by these companies \\[4\\] over various time periods (1-year, 3-years, 5-years & till date) and then compare it to our benchmark. \\[5\\]\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/serqaextp8q71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=18f15aea04e8a6decc25ff972c0bb01110d65bb5\n\n **Results** \n\n[ ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/hdjeau7zp8q71.png?width=953&format=png&auto=webp&s=a50598f9162d4b211dce3f202ff26e87296c52d8)\n\nCompanies in the most reputable list have consistently beaten SPY over different time periods. There is a significant improvement in overall return when holding the investment for a longer-term.\n\nMy hypothesis here is that, even though the short-term returns can be affected by market cycles, over the long run, companies having a great reputation end up outperforming their peers, and this is reflected in their stock price.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/shv1yw10q8q71.png?width=761&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b85dbf0596b22f9d93bfa3f1cd954f012e9e796\n\n Another interesting insight we can derive from the data is the performance of the top-10 companies in each year\u2019s list. As we can see, the most reputable brands beat SPY by a considerable margin in 7\/10 years \\[6\\]. \n\n[ ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/m10k3451q8q71.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=af6fb32d2245b0a5bc5d157d0931a91872716761)\n\nBut, before you YOLO your next paycheck into this strategy, do note that most of the returns were contributed by tech companies \\[5\\]. This is expected given the tech rally we had over the past decade. What is more interesting is how difficult it is to lose money investing in the top brands. Only 4 companies that were in the top 10 list over the past decade had a negative return. \n\n[ ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/gz1th2ytp8q71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab684cf2e2d4a3584b1c3590965c804bba19c284)\n\n**Limitations to the Analysis**\n\nThere are some limitations to the above analysis that you should be aware of before trying to replicate the strategy.\n\n* Ideally, the backtest should be done over 30-40 year\u2019s worth of data as we would know how the changing trends would impact the analysis. The last decade or so was predominantly biased towards tech.\n* One should also benchmark this against the companies having an average or poor reputation to see if reputation is indeed a distinguishing factor that is driving the returns. \\[7\\]\n* Finally, reputation is just one factor related to the company. There are companies whose reputations are in the gutter but have produced extraordinary returns for their shareholders (Facebook gave 175% return & Volkswagen gave 117% return in the last 5 years even after all the scandals they have been through). \n\n[ ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/cp1acpytp8q71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=79a8269e8083fdbdf4f44e9ef093ee54ee2b73c1)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhether you like it or not, brands seem to have a significant impact on our daily lives. Just think about the number of times you\/your friend have sworn by a brand and recommended it to everyone \\[8\\]. Almost all the brands in the top 10 list (eg. Rolex, Ferrari, Adidas, Harley-Davidson) have users that are extremely loyal, willing to pay a premium, and acts as unofficial spokespersons for the company.\n\nOur analysis, in turn, proves that all these positive factors cause the company to outperform the market!

First, it\u2019s not enough time as we can see from the first graph (there is very little difference in performance over 1 year period), and secondly, 2020 was one of the largest bull runs in the history of SPY.\n\n\\[7\\] [This report](https:\/\/www.rankingthebrands.com\/PDF\/Global%20RepTrak%20100%20Report%202016,%20Reputation%20Institute.pdf) by RepTrack shows the impact the Emission Scandal had on Volkswagen\n\n\\[8\\] Micheal Platt, Professor of Neuroscience at Yale [did a study](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=4eIDBV4Mpek&ab_channel=BigThink) that showcased that Apple users show brain empathy response to the Apple brand exactly the same way they would to a family member.

They also hold the largest number of PUTs (80,702 contracts), twice as many as second in line Susquehanna, and are the highest percentage out (10.550%) among those listed.  All other PUTs have since been re-filed on **6\/30\/2021**.\n\nI believe these dates indicate historical Collateralized Loan Obligation (CLO) activity associated with GameStop and provide an indication of what to expect as we move towards **9\/30\/2021** and onward.\n\n### Background\n\nIn January, February 2021 $126.6 billion of loans were said to have been repriced ([S+P Global - March 12th, 2021](https:\/\/www.spglobal.com\/marketintelligence\/en\/news-insights\/latest-news-headlines\/quick-take-us-clo-refinancing-and-reset-activity-surges-63108875)).\n\nArchegos was liquidated between March 12th and March 26th, 2021 ([Credit Suisse - July 29th, 2021](https:\/\/www.credit-suisse.com\/media\/assets\/corporate\/docs\/about-us\/investor-relations\/financial-disclosures\/results\/csg-special-committee-bod-report-archegos.pdf)).  It\u2019s been said that the firm turned **$10 billion into an estimated $100 billion** worth of assets ([Bloomberg - April 3rd, 2021](https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/opinion\/articles\/2021-04-03\/the-number-of-the-week-is-100-billion)). \n\n> \u201cTypically, for new-issue transactions, the CLO debt tranches are collectively 10 times the size of the notional amount of the equity interest.\u201d - https:\/\/www.stout.com\/en\/insights\/article\/primer-valuation-clo-equity-financial-reporting\n\nOn March 26th, 2021 the Fed reported a daily Reverse Repurchase amount of $11.4 billion.  By March 31st, the daily Reverse Repurchase amount skyrocketed up to $134 billion.  An increase of $124.297 billion. ([St. Louis Federal Reserve - RRP Chart](https:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/series\/)).  This was notable because the Fed\u2019s RRP activity had been effectively dormant until this uptick.\n\n### Hypothesis\n\nAs evidenced by the volume of CLO repricing in Jan\/Feb, the end date of the Archegos liquidation, proportion of equity compared to total Archegos assets and uptick in RRPs on March 31st, 2021 my reading leads me to believe that Archegos was more of a CLO Manager than Family Office and that some of their positions (illiquid investments in junk-grade CLOs) were auctioned off and then repriced to SOFR at the end of March 2021.\n\nHistorically CLOs were priced off 3-month LIBOR but, out of concern the benchmark was being manipulated by financial institutions, the Federal Reserve is in the process of transitioning CLOs to their own rate called SOFR that is based on the daily RRP amounts ([Bloomberg - July 8th, 2021](https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2021-07-08\/growing-clo-market-has-a-libor-transition-problem-on-horizon)).\n\n9\/30\/2021 is 3 days away and represents the 2nd-ever quarterly refinancing of CLOs after the formal recommendation of SOFR was made by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee ([AARC](https:\/\/www.newyorkfed.org\/arrc)) on July 29th, 2021.\n\nThere is a process called \u201cWarehousing\u201d in the CLO world where \u201cCLO Managers purchase initial collateral before the closing date\u201d which typically lasts 3-6 months ([Pinebridge - September 19th, 2019](https:\/\/www.pinebridge.com\/en\/insights\/clo-beyond-the-complexity)).\n\n**9\/30\/2021 represents the 6-month mark since Simplex filed their 80,702 PUT contracts**.\n\nGME close on 3\/31\/2021: $189.82\n\nGME close on 6\/30\/2021: $214.14\n\nGME close on 9\/30\/2021: ???\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile many of my posts have historically shied away from dates I believe the evidence here is too clear and strong to avoid mention.

This is perfect for a holiday stock buy because over the next 4 months you are going to see the price rise due to this and what's even better...\n\nThe stores have a natural break point attached to their rent agreements. This means if the store makes over a certain amount the mall gets a percentage of that.\n\nThis year is going to be huge.\n\nThe mall has been packed and I have been doing very well on both my companies. I pay SPG thousands of dollars for rent and it is going up a lot in November so I thought you all should know so all my money goes to your wife after the divorce.\n\nEven though I jumped in late for the covid recovery I really like the stock and the dividends have kept me holding for many months.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am in with 99 shares 133ish average.

        "745":"Options Hedging for 20 SEP 21: SDC IRNT GME SPY+ **TLDR: Stop gambling you allowance money without doing some due diligence. Read and you might learn something.** \n\n**Some intro:** I model how market making options moves underlying stocks. This has led to some cool predictions like a certain GameStore on a certain week in January doing some unusual things. Seriously go check my stuff out. Options move the underlying in a very quantifiable manner. Additionally examining the OI gives insights into market sentiment and price expectations. \n\n**Some requisite information and assumptions before getting started.**\n\nOptions are extremely volatile. That's why we're all here but Market Makers follow rules about hedging risks and for good reason. Near all options liquidity is provided by these firms which write the contracts and make money scalping the Bid\/Ask (literally making the market). MM's usually have both ends of a trade, i.e short both calls and puts, which balances out but the net difference results in a directional position. This has to be hedged for multiple reasons not limited to 1. going bankrupt and 2.  betting against clients (this is serious.) They make their money from scalping the B\/A and IV crush. Options are priced that if \u0394 neutral, the MM makes money when IV decreases and loses if it increases. \n\nThat brings us to Delta (\u0394). **\u0394 is the rate of change with respect to spot price (+\/- $1)**. Now that doesn't mean anything but think about \u0394 as the % chance an option expires itm (implied moneyness). This is also the directional risk for a MM who wrote the contract. Gamma \u0393 is the rate of change of \u0394 for +\/- $1 on the underlying. \u0393 is also hedged on MM books. This is done by trading shares and contracts of the underlying which influences price discovery resistance levels. \n\nTo model this we make a few assumptions:\n\n* All contracts are being hedged directionally neutral (This isn't true but is an acceptable assumption to yield a working model)\n* The directional risk of a call and put on the same strike counteract\n* Enough of the boring stuff\n\nThis will be less in depth and more broad in scope than my previous work.

        "746":"GME is about to fuk u with its negative beta. Greetings to the most intelligent people on the planet!\n\nI've been playing with GME and the other charts recently, and it all accumulated into a massive piece of delicious TA,  which I didn't really plan to post to WSB originally - because I felt like some of the honorable WSB residents might be a little tired from that particular stonk. However, after seening [this](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/pppfro\/tmc_spotted_the_cock_and_balls_upside_down_head\/) and [this](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/pph9f0\/as_you_can_see_tmc_is_forming_a_classic_nut_sack\/) beautiful examples of intellectual superiority, I just couldn't resist sharing my hard work with you, dear WSB!(If you, dear reader, are the one who is fed up with GME, then I would recommend you stop reading now and follow the two links above to appreciate HQ TA on other stonks).\n\nFor those, who stayed - enjoy the read!\n\nIt all started from my \u201cL'Oreal shampoo commercial\u201d-like hair bet post, where, in its third chapter, I was theorizing about GME's negative beta (particularly in light of the late January events, when the buy button was disabled) and the current general market setup - how it might influence subsequent GME moves. So, I decided to dive deeper into those correlations and deviations between the price movements of GME and other major assets, using January sneeze as the starting point. This led me to a fascinating, tits-jacking discovery that points at the upcoming inevitable volatile price action!\n\nBuckle up for the TA journey of your life, let\u2019s ~~dive~~ fly in!\n\nOh, almost forgot to quote Jack Black:\n\n>\u201cThis is not the financial advice, no.  \n>  \n>This is just a tribute.  \n>  \n>Couldn't remember becoming a financial advisor, no.  \n>  \n>This is a tribute, oh, to the greatest stonk in the world, alright!\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst things first, it\u2019s a good idea therefore to revisit **late Jan events**, which in my opinion was the moment of revelation and a preview of inevitable storm, when:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# I. The North Remembers:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[GME v VIX v SP, 30 min chart](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/yu1zzckpa2o71.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e10bd82e172e82ea16a68da5c9c4a9c3e07f70ff)\n\n* GME shares added more than 500% in less than two days, showing off its negative beta in all glory,\n* making VIX volatility index explode more than 60% in a single day,\n* and injuring SP badly (sharp decline of about 4% in 21 hours).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt this point, the thesis should sound something like GME\ud83c\udd99VIX\ud83c\udd99=SP\ud83c\udd98, and vice versa. It will be developed further in the next chapters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, quoting my bet post here:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Pepperidge apes should remember that during one of the Gamestop congressional hearings Vlad 'the Stock Implaler' Tenev mentioned something about late January events falling into five-sigma category, which scientifically speaking corresponds to a p-value, or probability, of 3x10-7, or about 1 in 3.5 million. He also used such a hackneyed expression as a 'black swan' event.  \n>  \n>...  \n>  \n>Categorizing January craze as five sigma is debatable to say the least, because Gamestop shares started to skyrocket and multiply in price long before late January, and it doesn't take a lot of wrinkles to understand that the volatility should likely increase further, requiring additional collateral and somewhat decent risk management. However, I'm not going to discuss Vlad's choice of sacrificing Robbinhood users (disabling buy button) in order to protect the solvency of Robbinhood customers (Citadel and co), because that has been done enough times already, and the North remembers. Rather, Robbinhood example and Vlad's interpretation are provided here as a vivid illustration of the fact which we all feel deep inside: there is just too much risk in the market, it is being too much fucking over-leveraged so that even a fucking retail stock broker may easily get margin-called in a matter of hours. It is especially hilarious, considering the fact that unsophisticated actions of buying and holding a particular stock is enough to fuck the system, making the entire house of cards fall apart. The problem is that when you dive deeper, 2008 seem to be a blessing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFurthermore, I should recommend  you reading u\/peruvian_bull Endgame series, and\/or u\/Criand the Bigger Short in order to develop the understanding of the fundamental processes taking place under the hood of the financial markets. To sum up the core idea: the financial system is over-levereged, way more than it was in 2008, and coupled with the industry poor risk assessment standards, it is heading to the next, coming soon, financial crisis. And, in my opinion, what you can see on the charts above, was a sneak peak of the house of cards collapsing. Disabling the buy button was the only option for the big moni guys to stop (or rather to postpone) the system failing miserably. By bringing this dirty trick into play they were able to ~~buy~~ steal some time, which was necessary for deploying emergency measures and urgent market mechanisms (such as new DTCC\/NSCC rules) - which, in turn, are aimed at mitigating the inevitable financial hail**shit**storm, ready to hit the fans.\n\nThere is a plenty of outstanding fundamentals DD on that topic (start from clicking profiles in the paragraph above). As for me, I am the TA type of a wrincle-brained ape, so...\n\nLet me speak from my ~~heart~~ charts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# II. Negative beta more beautiful than Catherine Zeta\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's start from something that you must have heard about many times, but did you really dive into GME exceptional beta? So, what's that thing and why is it so negative? For the sake of saving my and your time, let me quote the almighty Inve**stop**edia:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>In investing, beta does not refer to fraternities, product testing, or old videocassettes. Beta is a measurement of market risk or volatility. That is, it indicates how much the price of a stock tends to fluctuate up and down compared to other stocks.  \n>  \n>The value of any stock index, such as the Standard & Poor's 500 Index, moves up and down constantly. At the end of the trading day, we conclude that \"the markets\" were up or down. An investor considering buying a particular stock may want to know whether that stock moves up and down just as sharply as stocks in general. It may be inclined to hold its value on a bad day or get stuck in a rut when most stocks are rising; whereas the beta is the number that measures a stock's volatility, the degree to which its price fluctuates in relation to the overall stock market. In other words, it gives a sense of the stock's risk compared to that of the greater market's.  \n>  \n>Beta is used also to compare a stock's market risk to that of other stocks. Analysts use the Greek letter '\u00df' to represent beta.Beta is calculated using regression analysis. A beta of 1 indicates that the security's price tends to move with the market. A beta greater than 1 indicates that the security's price tends to be more volatile than the market. A beta of less than 1 means it tends to be less volatile than the market.  \n>  \n>**Negative beta**: A beta less than 0, which would indicate an inverse relation to the market, is possible but highly unlikely.\n\nEssentially, negative beta asset is an asset that tends to move in the opposite direction from the general market. Famous precious metal is one of the good examples: gold and gold stocks have negative betas because they tend to do better when the stock market declines. That is exactly the reason why investors cherish this asset in the turbulent time of recessions, market crashes and corrections, or general uncertainty and volatility - historically gold tends to perform well during such periods, providing the 'safe heaven' to market participants and acting as a hedge. Noice, but this turbulent time we have something special on the horizon.\n\n\\*\\*Le wild negative beta unicorn appears\\*\\*\n\n[Captain GME to gold](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/rpv734w9c2o71.png?width=471&format=png&auto=webp&s=56080fa590e5ecb6f65ad1a72329cd4d12569014)\n\nMany of you must have seen -\u00df posts, but math and numbers are for geniuses, retards only understand crayons and visuals, so...\n\nLadies and gentleapes, with the great pleasure I present you the new negative beta king:\n\n[GME v SP, daily chart](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/iwtaoohhc2o71.jpg?width=2039&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=67b2824b31bf155c6f7d5f992c5141f67a82cdfb)\n\nWhat you see on the chart above is a vivid illustration of GME's negative beta behavior, which commenced during\/after the January sneeze. As for SP, the stable uptrend with the minor corrections is evident, while the asset is achieving ATHs on a regular basis. Looking at the GME now and connecting its highs with the median line, we may observe the opposite trend, as the line is descending. All in all, there is a big-ass convergence manifesting between the two assets, which most probably will result in the increased volatility and the explosive GME breakout \/ trend reversal for SP. Who will blink first?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[GME v SP daily chart + Tower of Pisa](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/3fiwmwwqc2o71.jpg?width=2033&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=63ecddcaa4651b946a4df8541409c8d8e547d435)\n\nNext, take a look at this chart. Don't worry about GME's Pisa offset here, as it is insignificant for the point I'm making (and I had some struggles overlaying the charts in this case). If the previous chart indicates a longer term negative correlation, the one above is like a zoom in: there is an obvious series of divergences and convergences highlighted yellow and blue respectively, which illustrate negative beta again, but on a smaller scale and with local trends. As you can see, as soon a GME bullrun commences and accelerates, SP dips, and vice versa. I hope, that the examples provided are persuasive, and that they helped you to reach the same conclusion as I did, namely: sstonk goes up when stonks go down, while when stonks go up, GME is suppressed = GME\ud83c\udd99SP\ud83c\udd98. Should that correlation continue manifesting itself (which I'm pretty damn confident it will), the exciting times are on the way.\n\nOk, so \ud83c\udd99\ud83c\udd98 is a simple concept, but why is it important, you may ask.\n\nWell, that's why:\n\n[SP, daily chart ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/6b41eaewc2o71.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d9ae4bdc7758ecdbc84425e6ea567e1d4243f9e1)\n\nSP has been forming a powerful bearish technical formation called the rising wedge, through the past year and a half. Currently it is narrowing down, and the point of breakout is not far away - typically it is to the downside for such a technical setup. Add GME with its negative beta to this equation - if you know, you know.\n\n[SP 4H chart, I called it \u2018Head of Penis\u2019 formation ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/sbs9va8od2o71.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ce9b57e1a6fa2020ac1c91218ad5d462ceda5d07)\n\nBut wait, there\u2019s more!\n\n[SP, monthly chart ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/1goqfoa2e2o71.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e3eefcd4720f38907877a2791ea642c3955122b5)\n\nIn one of my TA longwrites, the Big Short 2.0, I identified a beautiful, long term, juicy Elliott 1-2-3-4-5 impulse wave structure on SP, take a look!

Volatility, or the severity of price fluctuations, is usually helpful to gauge market sentiment, particularly the degree of fear and uncertainty spreading on the financial markets. Investors use VIX to measure the level of risk, fear, or stress in the market when making investment decisions. It is an important index in the world of finance because it provides a quantifiable measure of market risk and investors' sentiments.\n\nAnd who would have guessed, throughout the year VIX spikes have been accompanying almost every single GME major run, but for one:\n\n[GME v VIX, daily log chart](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ksd03p5pe2o71.jpg?width=1969&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=835dee5dd6c8b5367088857995e01a720f41f13a)\n\nJust one major outlier to that tandem is late November 2020 run. Speaking of outliers, also VIX middle of June 2021 spike seems to stand out from the crowd, as there is no relevant proportionate positive price action on the GME side. Outside of those two occasions, the correlational behaviour of these two instruments is evident. Moreover, VIX and GME runs correlate to the extent that their peaks match time-wise in several run ups. Furthermore, take a look at how starting 2021 four out of five major VIX spikes correspond with the occasions when GME\u2019s price action was trialling $230-ish level (margin call level, it seems) - the price territory, around which my concept of the \u2018Purple Haze\u2019 resistance (\u201cbreak to initiate the squeeze\u201d) is established, refer to the short squeezes comparisons post to explore the concept. The correlational behaviour described above, to my understanding, points at two big conclusions: the first and the most obvious one, is GME\ud83c\udd99VIX\ud83c\udd99; secondly, it seems that GME is currently the biggest risk for the market! - too much synchronicity is present between the two, for this to be a mere coincidence. Remember, VIX represents volatility, fear and stress - wut feelin Kenny?\n\nOh, and did I mention?\n\n[VIX, daily chart ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/q0hb68xue2o71.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2bcfaadcd5304e1c57307f4b954759dd402f33f8)\n\nDuring the year and a half, the instrument\u2019s price action has been consolidating into a beautiful bullish formation, called the descending wedge - which is exactly the opposite of what SP is consolidating into. VIX descending wedge + SP rising wedge + GME\ud83c\udd99VIX\ud83c\udd99SP\ud83c\udd98, quick math, and\n\n[We get an ape\u2019s best friend, Gator the Bubbles Deflator \\(the Greater\\).](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/2fzj2pdye2o71.jpg?width=2032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ecbdb4676a65c16dee75b9d3613fde91cecf7335)\n\nIf you know, you know.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# IV. This is the tits-jacking part. Achtung! You have been warned!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlright, that was quiet a TA journey. I hope that the discussion above helped you to build the solid understanding of what's happening on broader financial markets and how those correlations and tendencies are affecting GME price action, and will probably add the fuel to the rocket in the upcoming major GME moves. Now, the focus of the discussion is back on the GME current TA status quo! (yeah, finally!) And, what can I say, it is so fucking juicy!\n\nFirstly, let me remind you about this TA of mine, which aged like a fine wine:\n\n[GME, daily log chart ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ibiauo96f2o71.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d4645e967977f6c91ad71f07546993dc6140fda1)\n\nThe log chart support above proved itself to be an ape's ultimate best friend! As you can see, during the year, each time the price action approached the lower support, a sharp re-bounce followed - August and September confirmed the price line as THE most important support, manifesting the steadfast buying pressure. That pressure is currently confronting the most important resistance for GME in 2021 (magenta line). The battle will be legendary! (Hint: remember the current market setups discussed in II, and III, and the correlations? Based solely on that, what do you think the GME breakout will look like?)\n\nBut wait, there's more! Let's change the viewing ~~tri~~angle:\n\n[GME, daily chart ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/nii0wtvhf2o71.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d29dc68d5034aa1a8258a22dae522f241ab3b196)\n\nHm, looks familiar. I swear, I must have seen this TA setup before!

Retardos love triangles, and this love has a fair justification. Triangles incarnate the flattening of the price accompanied by diminishing volatility - for the price action subsequently to make a fucking explosion, should the triangle be broken out. The perfect example of that is theatre stonk\u2019s price action after the breakout. \\*\\* GME: \"Hold my beer\" \\*\\* I'm pretty much convinced, that the triangle on GME chart above is how the Mother Of All Triangles must look like.\n\nButth waaitt, therrz moooore!

What do you think, fellow professional investors?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR: there is a strong correlational behaviour which goes like GME\ud83c\udd99VIX\ud83c\udd99SP500\ud83c\udd98, and which is evident when you overlay and compare the charts. According to the current \u2018the everything GME\u2019 market setup, GME is ready to moon fuelled by the upcoming massive VIX spike and the sharp SP 500 !negative beta rulez! correction (which is way overdue already, as the rally is longer than 10 years and SP is craving the proper bear market). Based on the TA outlook, the moment of revelation is just around the corner...

At one point, I decided to put together as much money as possible and went all in on GameStop after the first squeeze.\n\nWhen GameStop hit $340 the second time, I sold it all literally 5 minutes before it dipped, and made $65k.\n\nSince that moment, I've been trading with $50k+ and it's been really easy to make money, so I decided to quit my job. After quitting, I got my hand into $25k that they had to pay me as severance.\n\nBottom line: I extinguished all my loans BUT $27k I owe the bank, and right now I'm trading with $65k. I figured that, considering taxes, I have to make $1500 monthly to break even (monthly expenses + loan rate). If I pay off the bank, that amount is reduced to $700 monthly expenses.\n\nHowever, if I pay off the bank, my trading power will be reduced to $35k, which is insufficient, in my experience, to make money just trading stocks. So what do I do? Keep trading until those $65k become, lets say, $100k, and then pay off the bank?

Well, look no further, friend! Using my masterful TA skills, I'm going to cure you of that burning sensation you get when you ~~pee~~ *look at your portfolio*! With this ***one simple trick***, all of your terrible life choices will resolve themselves into brilliant investment decisions! And for the first time ever: featuring a TL;DR on a Cbass post. Wow!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR: We're all going to be rich\\* as fuck!**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Table of Contents:**\n\nPart 1. Begun, the Meme Wars have\n\n1. GME\n2. AMC\n3. BB\n4. CLOV\n\nPart 2. The Voice of Alex Jones\n\nPart 3. A New Hope\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Part 1. Begun, the Meme Wars have**\n\nThis past week saw an appreciable awakening of the memes, particularly GME and AMC, with knock-on effects across the whole of the Meme-verse. This was followed by a sea of gain porn and concomitant conspiracy theories about insiders among us.\n\nWell, ol' Cbass is here to clear things up with Star Wars references, bad jokes, and even worse TA. So let's have us a gander at some magic space-wizard charts to answer the age old question: ***Am I going to lose all my money.... again?***\n\nStarting with the OG, GME:\n\n[We're comin' fer ya, hedgies! Reee!](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/1a4yyt2we6k71.png?width=1576&format=png&auto=webp&s=6ef8fcd2046ff1417684d4a52f17a0353ff02e03)\n\nAccording to my long since discarded thesis, GME was supposed to find support at the $218 level where the last breakout occurred (Launch #3). That failed worse than my last date, oh so many years ago. Then someone here claimed that the thin green uptrend line I've got on there was supposed to hold. That failboat sailed to a galaxy far, far away. But the #2b breakout line did, at last, managed to hold. And then we got a breakout of that nasty red downtrend this week and now we're trying, once more to breakout of the #3 line.\n\nSo, does GME have it in itself to enter hyperspace? Well, from a DD perspective earnings are coming up and that is probably going to spell doom or boom for the ticker. The company is in the midst of a turnaround, so it at least has a good story going for it (unlike anything Disney owns).\n\nFrom a TA perspective... well, to be honest, TA is just there so you can feel better or worse about your decision. It can't really predict all that much, except for after the fact. But it can give traders some piece of mind before the fact; a sort of all-clear that many need before jumping in a position. To that extent, getting out from under that downtrend was a big deal. From here, it's all on the shoulders of retail to initiate **Operation Bagholder Rescue**, if it is to happen at all.\n\n**Cbass's Call for GME:** I actually think you ~~retards~~ *brilliant, forward thinking investors* have it in you to break back over $218. Can you bust the $330 double top? I'm not so confident, but I'd be happily proven wrong.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNext up, an empty movie theater for a Disney Star Wars showing, AMC:\n\n[Supreme stupidity, in chart form](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ja0puvoug6k71.png?width=1576&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab226485fe17812dfc4c94cd4d0d661d31d6eb56)\n\nMy previous thesis called for AMC to retrace to the #2a line, $14.54. Whelp, y'all decided to buy up the whole damn company and proceeded to prove me wrong. But in the true form of a TA Jedi Master, I've just *ex post facto* revised my thesis so that I'm still correct: Now I'm calling the May-June launch a Double-Event, so powerful it impregnated half the girls in Bangkok, because *reasons*. Accordingly, the settling at the #2b line is right in line with my \"original\" thesis. This is how it's done, young padawan.\n\nHaving found that support, this week saw AMC also breakout of a downtrend line. I've included a small uptrend channel that I saw on some other guy's AMC TA, and we've dropped back into that. Unlike GME, there is not a significant resistance line above the current position, which is nice.\n\nFrom a DD perspective, there is not much great to say about this company and \"fundamentals\" are doing nothing but holding the ticker back. Maybe if Disney hadn't fucked up Star Wars, there'd be some major films to fill the seats right now. Furthermore, management's penchant for stock sales and the possibility of more to come if you idiots actually moon this thing again *is not helping*.\n\n**Cbass's Call for AMC:** Skies look pretty clear to me; up is the direction. I wouldn't count on that channel lasting for too long, though. On the other hand, if you wunderkinds *can't* get this thing to moon, gravity will ruin your day, week, month, year, and for some of you extra special ones: *your entire financial future*.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNext, a company somehow survived irrelevancy, BB:\n\n[Extra \\\\\"special\\\\\" line drawing skills here](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/o39cqkfcj6k71.png?width=1576&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a723faac2fda7a0dfffd6e5248d5665bac3f7b8)\n\nJust like GME, BB failed to settle at the previous breakout line (#3), and instead decided you fuckers needed the ***executive tour*** of the S&M dungeon before finally settling around $9.50. BB has since broken out of *two* down trend lines! That means it's going to moon twice as hard, bro! You can readjust line #3 so it's at $11.56 or so, and then it looks like this past week's action tested and failed that line, just like was the case for GME. Indeed, from a chart-perspective GME and BB are the most closely aligned (with BBBY being a somewhat retarded cousin that ~~I've~~ *everyone has* given up talking about).\n\nFrom the DD perspective, apparently BB has some magic AI shit going for it and it's related to security and cars and shit. Whatever, just sounds like Cathie Woodisms to me, but such platitudes are the nectar of the masses and if that gets 'em to buy, who fuckin' cares.\n\nOn the TA side, this is in the same boat as GME. You've got to at least break over $11.50 to stand a chance. Over that, the skies are clear for a run into the twenties and that'll be enough for the gamblers to start hurling YOLO's at it once more.\n\n**Cbass's Call on BB**: Up if GME goes up. Sideways or down otherwise. This one's not going to move independent of Big Daddy. It's also not going to move as hard because of the large free float.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd finally, the little brother that your mom made to take to the party and is now embarrassing you in front of the hot chicks, CLOV:\n\n[No, CLOV, you were supposed to be the Chosen One. Not ruin my portfolio!](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/45d9m8f9m6k71.png?width=1576&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a3985c252a10b333677c7749da916ebf1b6f171)\n\nNow, I know some of you are thinking: CLOV? What the fuck? CLOV doesn't belong on this list. It belongs on the list with WISH, WKHS and all that other garbage. And you'd be right to think that. But I still own CLOV, and it is ***technically*** not dead. It's just ***mostly dead***, and if you've seen the Princess Bride, you know that mostly dead has a cure.... unlike my stupidity. In addition, CLOV has been hovering near the top of the sentiment lists for some time, so there's that.\n\nLike the others above, CLOV has broken out of a downtrend, or possibly two (I was generous with that second, orange line). However, unlike BB or GME, CLOV is nowhere near its prior breakout level. Indeed, the $9 mark is proving to be an impenetrable barrier. We might actually need a Zombie Dragon to take that fucker down. On the good side of the TA, the \\~$8 line is proving to be the actual bottom.\n\nOn the DD side, CLOV had its earnings and they were wholly unimpressive. The clovtards dug deep to find the nuggets of good, but the overall market said, \"Yeah, nah bitch,\" and slapped it back down with an extra helping of pimp-hand.\n\n**Cbass's Call for CLOV:** It exists to fuck up my yearly P\/L, but if GME and AMC can take off, they'll carry CLOV and its whole clown army up with them. Problem is, there's no imminent breakout overhead. We've got to go up a ways before any true breakout can be attempted. Which means unless we get a truly epic launch of the whole Meme Space Force, CLOV has the potential to get shot down before ever getting back up to the high teens, let alone the twenties.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Part 2. The Voice of Alex Jones**\n\nIt's conspiracy theory time! Yayy!\n\nSo the voice of Alex Jones came to me in a dream the other night and it got me wondering: Is this whole endeavor an elaborate trap to ensnare idiot retail traders into terrible options that are certain to expire worthless? Let's look at the evidence.\n\nFirst, we didn't get any breakouts until after the 8\/20 expiry. Together with the 7\/16 expiry, this represented (I believe) a ***massive*** chunk of options. I saw this regarding CLOV, and I suspect it is a similar story for GME, AMC and BB, and a whole host of other 'meme stocks.'\n\nSecond, I'm *quite sure* at this point that Big Money is behind the Jedi Options Wizardry that causes these massive spikes. Originally, I thought that this was just a Big Money vs. Big Money game and we were naught but pawns in their schemes.\n\nNow... I'm beginning to think ~~aliens~~ ***the House*** is in on it. Basically, they are going to let\/help the meme stock launches in order to rope a bunch of idiots into buying shitty options. Particularly, those who buy them on the downslope of the spikes, hoping for a quick rebound. Those options are going to be easy to kill and the House can clean up.\n\nBut they'll never get the chance if the whole meme stock \"movement\" dies a slow death. It is only by hanging a line out, enticing the morons with dreams of easy money and fast cars and loose women that they can get y'all to bite in large enough numbers. Basically, the sight of those big green dildos is impossible to resist and FOMO takes over and you dipshits buy options that are all but DoA.\n\n**So, is this all just a trap?** Answer: **yes**, no matter which way you look at it.\n\nEven disregarding my tinfoil hat ramblings, this past week's action has the smell of a classic bull-trap.\n\n**But does it actually matter?** Answer: **no**. You can still make money, and a fuck load of it, even if my tinfoil hat theory is right. *Especially* if it's right, in fact.\n\n[We're gonna last a lot longer against those hedge funds than we will against that Citadel!](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/s1xs80j3y6k71.jpg?width=2181&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=80ffff00b19d3dea26c921fe6337e039c10b8a8e)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Part 3. A New Hope**\n\nI've been sensing a turning of opinion in the short time I've been here with you all. When I first came upon this wonderful community of simpletons, DD posts about new companies were most often met with \"You had me at retard\" and \"I'm all in.\"\n\nNow it seems people are too scared to post high quality DD's because the immediate response is \"Fuck your pump & dump and your mom while we're at it!\" Were there pump and dumps? Too many to count. Did I fall for one? Probably.\n\nWhile some OGs are breathing a sigh of relief at this relative return to \"normality,\" and I can't blame them, I still feel a certain something has been lost. That magic feeling, that tingling in the ballsack that whispered to you, \"*this is stupid, but it might actually work anyway*.\" This week, for one glorious moment, I felt that again and damn did it feel good.\n\nSure we bagholders are a pitiable bunch. That cannot be denied, even if we keep it close to the chest, even, I think, for those most ardent cult members. Still, there is something to be said of keeping hope alive, of holding on to the belief that broken and battered simpletons left atop seemingly insurmountable peaks on charts awash in red ***can still be saved***.\n\nSo as another week comes upon us, I implore you to not lose hope, for it is *literally all we have left*. Hear that John Williams score rise in the ether about you, and know this: It's not over until we blow up ~~the Death Star~~ *our accounts*! (^(Or Disney buys us))\n\n[Que the Journey, ladies and gentlemen.](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/g8isr2tq07k71.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c2dff374b682ca9cc4fef8539d121905c1401284)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\\*Rich can mean a lot of things, such as: rich in spirit, rich in experience, or rich in delusions of grandeur.**\n\nPositions or ban, a.k.a., the *Portfolio of Destiny*:\n\n[I've got 'em on the ropes, boys!](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/hk65a8ow17k71.jpg?width=1675&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=89bab8c2e7df13eec9c10c339c76940983978f34)\n\nEdits for spelling and grammar, per usual.\n\nEdit: I just now realized, a day later, that I used the wrong roman numeral in the title... fml.",

Rather, it was a fair attempt to critically assess the stonk's technical setup through the prism of the two most famous SS historical examples:\n\n[VW](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/h7b6sm9t43j71.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a1da13436e92326b0ec63688d81f39f17574acb8)\n\n[and TSLA](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/iz041qtv43j71.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1174f413961be8903377068f5e41ce538f115f23)\n\n[The OC post and analysis](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/nc6qi3\/lets_revive_the_buried_wsb_culture_gme_to\/) (which is still worth your reading, especially if you want to grasp this chapter of the post in greater detail) took me a lot of effort to produce, and I am still proud to have done this work, distilling the essential components of a short squeeze structure, and creating at least some sort of a framework to apply in cases like the current one. However, GME price during the summer did not follow the pattern, and particularly its most anticipated triangular 'Squieezluminati Confirmed' stage.\n\n[by Pink Floyd is one of my favourite songs](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ncwwuqz253j71.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=188c089eeef5aeb0308614caba55c538e84ccbe1)\n\nDoes it render the whole thing void? Well, that's what I've been thinking in August while morally preparing myself for the beard apostasy. But something didn't quiet fit, and I kept digging. Just to stumble upon this:\n\n[AMCSS, daily chart](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/58sg96eg53j71.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5b9d97cdc553fe4645cd76576d26c8b0c73122ae)\n\nLooks familiar, doesn't it? Ladies and apemen, with a great pleasure I present you AMCSS, the timing of which is really similar to what I was betting my beard on in relation to GME. What happened to AMC during the summer actually proves almost every single point from my SS thesis. Firstly, the 'Purple Haze' level ($14.38) is the main resistance on the chart, and only when the breakout occurs, the SS unfolds. Secondly, 'Squeezy Grail' (the cup shaped consolidation) and the 'Runway' (rectangle) phases precede the squeeze impulse - that's where the buying pressure accumulates, to the point when it can no longer be suppressed. Next, interestingly enough, trend based Fibonacci periods grid allows to predict the peak date (vertical line marked as 1) extremely accurately, if the preliminary trend + the 'Squeezy Grail' phase are used as its core measurement (red dashed line). But wait, there's more! The 'Purple Haze' resistance is in between 1 and 0.786 Fibo levels (horizontal), while the retracement itself measures the amplitude of the SS impulse perfectly - e.g. take a look at how the price action retraces to 0.5 Fibo after the peak, or how the price consolidates in the channel of 0.236-0.382 after that. Well, the thesis fits almost perfectly to AMC - I hope you're now sitting like\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/nltp4a1l53j71.jpg?width=550&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3e9489b7944a802185db6adc69121f72b4e546dc\n\nThere are several minor deviations from the SS frameworks which should be mentioned too, though: the PH breakout occurs during 0.618 Fibo period, rather than 0.382, as it was in historical examples; the triangular phase doesn't really resemble a triangle. Notwithstanding those minor factors, original SS thesis is more than alive with the AMC example.\n\nYou might be thinking now: what defuq is this crazy dude is talking about, where is the video of the beard shaved? Well, I'm providing the AMCSS analysis here in order to prove that my thesis is legitimate, and GME price action had to follow the pattern. GME and AMC are like brothers in arms, with 'similar' fundamentals, and through the major part of 2021 those two have been moving in tandem, strongly following linear correlation principle. The thesis structure (built upon TSLA and VW historical examples) indicates that there is the strong buying pressure accumulating, and in AMC example the lid was opened for a bit to let the steam out; while GME is still being suppressed even further during the current consolidation, and in my opinion - it is done artificially and purposely.\n\nFurthermore, take a look at this:\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/44m2qp2q53j71.png?width=1880&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2c9f3297506328e1c0b4a5bd4f5cfa4105a29e8\n\nWhat you see above is the screenshot from [my other post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/nwub7d\/gme_to_amc_and_bb_last_week_ladies_go_first_gme\/), where I explained that two stonks had extremely similar technical setups: both have long-ass triangular consolidation at the core, which is subsequently broken out to the upside. Next, take a look at MACDs or TSIs from both examples, and particularly at what is highlighted by rectangles - zoom in and see for yourself, the structures are close to being identical. So, the question arises: why if two stocks have very similar fundamental and technical backgrounds, one is allowed to moon a little bit, while the other one is being knocked out each time right before the lift off should occur? The answer if fairly obvious, and it's because some big financial boys want things to go this way. AMC is something they can control, or maybe they even benefit from it\u2019s price fluctuations. While GME is a Pandora box, and they try to keep its lid close for as long as possible, soothed by an illusion of a controllable chaos. And those suckers are ready to use any method to suppress the price, especially \\*\\*insert Aliens Guy meme here\\*\\*: manipulation.\n\nApes from a friendly sub uncovered many such methods, like good old FTDs, married puts, OTC trades, wash sales, darkpools... I'm not going to discuss those things in this post, because there is a plenty of outstanding DD on reddit. I'm just going to borrow this picture from u\/AutoDrafter2020 because it speaks for itself, in my opinion:\n\n[GME daily chart](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/klztgzo563j71.png?width=1614&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e54f3009eaafcd3c4aa5f4d04ef0779fe69803a)\n\nAs you can see yourself, every major piece of fundamentally good news for GME has resulted in price suppression, and each of the dirty play instruments mentioned above played a role in this shitshow to one degree or another. The manipulation is so blatantly obvious that it makes me sick. Manipulating the market is not cheap, and probably costs fuckers on the other side of the trade millions, if not billions every month. Why would there be so much effort and resources put into the war over a \u2018memestonk\u2019? Is it so that they want some random noname reddit retard to lose his precious beard? The actual answer is shocking, and in my opinion it should be sought in two Greek letters, **\u03c3 (sigma)** and **\u03b2 (beta**).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Chapter II. How 1987 and 2008 are reincarnating into 2021\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPepperidge apes should remember that during one of the Gamestop congressional hearings Vlad 'the Stock Implaler' Tenev mentioned something about late January events falling into five-sigma category, which scientifically speaking corresponds to a p-value, or probability, of 3x10-7, or about 1 in 3.5 million. He also used such a hackneyed expression as a 'black swan' event. Quote from a [Bloomberg article](https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/opinion\/articles\/2021-02-19\/gamestop-hearing-robinhood-is-cool-but-is-it-out-of-its-depth):  \n\n\n>A \u201cblack swan\u201d event \u2014 made famous by Nassim Nicholas Taleb in a best seller that parsed the role of randomness in finance and life \u2014 comes as a surprise, has great impact and later becomes rationalized away as easily explained or predicted. *Many things that appear to be black swans, however, aren\u2019t unforeseeable and are merely classified as such to avoid responsibility for not spotting them ahead of time in the first place*. A \u201cfive-sigma event\u201d is a statistical descriptor of something that occurs five standard deviations away from and on either side of the mean in a data set. It describes the odds of something happening, and in five-sigma territory the odds are long.\n\nCategorizing January craze as five sigma is debatable to say the least, because Gamestop shares started to skyrocket and multiply in price long before late January, and it doesn't take a lot of wrinkles to understand that the volatility should likely increase further, requiring additional collateral and somewhat decent risk management. However, I'm not going to discuss Vlad's choice of sacrificing Robbinhood users (disabling buy button) in order to protect the solvency of Robbinhood customers (Citadel and co), because that has been done enough times already, and the North remembers. Rather, Robbinhood example and Vlad's interpretation are provided here as a vivid illustration of the fact which we all feel deep inside: there is just too much risk in the market, it is being too much fucking over-leveraged so that even a fucking retail stock broker may easily get margin-called in a matter of hours. It is especially hilarious, considering the fact that unsophisticated actions of buying and holding a particular stock is enough to fuck the system, making the entire house of cards fall apart. The problem is that when you dive deeper, 2008 seem to be a blessing.\n\nFor example, let's start from the easy difficulty, take a look at this chart:\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/47plfcth63j71.jpg?width=910&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=90c6f9cfa07676ce106f2f111b12a557f09fd8bc\n\nOne of the major indicators of how the leverage is utilized is FINRA's margin statistics from its members (who carry margin accounts for customers), which FINRA publishes every month. There are several points of interest for us on the chart above. The first and the most important one is that margin dept has tripled after previous major bottom in 2009, from about $300 billions to almost $900 bn in 2021. Furthermore, take a look at how MD reaches the peak of $500 bn both in 2000 and 2007, and it's sufficient to send S&P into several years bear market with 50% retrace, as soon as the leveraging trend reverses. Currently, MD is on its way to trilly, the figure has almost doubled compared to 2000 and 2007. Sounds a bit GUHy, doesn't it? Also, looking at the margin debt before the .com bubble, 2007 financial crisis and Covid crash it can be seen that, each time, the margin contraction starts before the crash itself, making MD a leading indicator. And guess what? MD is down 4.3% in July, which is the first major decline in 15 months. Deleveraging is a painful process, but is necessary for markets\u2019 health, and it seem to have already begun.\n\nHowever, this time it is going to be so much fucking worse. To quote a brilliant mind, u\/Criand:  \n\n\n>2008 never finished. It was can-kicked and the same people who caused the crash have still been running rampant doing the same bullshit in the derivatives market as that market continues to be unregulated. They're profiting off of short-term gains at the risk of killing their institutions and potentially the global economy.\n\nI strongly recommend you reading his informative 2008 post in full, because it is a fascinating financial journey, through which you will learn a lot about how fuk the financial system really is right now, largely because of leverage. Imagine if r\/WallStreetBets was a central bank. Fuck, this must be the most spot on metaphor I came up with in my entire life. Actually, it seems now that the entire financial world is one fucking giant WSB right now. And not in the good sense of its reputation.\n\nTo quote another brilliant mind, u\/peruvian_bull, whose series of posts has been peer-reviewed by an economics professor:  \n\n\n>The entire derivatives market is HUGE. The BIS estimated the total notional value of the OTC derivatives market to be $640 Trillion in 2019! And that doesn't even include exchange-listed derivatives like most common option contracts. More sober estimates put it somewhere north of $1 Quadrillion. Numbers of this size are hard to wrap your head around - this is equivalent to a million billion, or a thousand trillion- for reference, the US economy is around $22 Trillion and the world economy is estimated to be $88 Trillion - thus the entire world economy could fit into the notional derivatives market 11x over and STILL not reach it. Every single bank is exposed, either directly or indirectly, to this market. For example, Deutsche Bank ALONE has over $47 Trillion in Notional gross exposure - TWICE the size of the entire US Economy!\n\n[Wow](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/enhgxe0773j71.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6839e329715d3c47d81048d7c21054b9f218b306)\n\n*Intermediate TL;DR: the financial market is sufficiently levered according to its risk tolerance, and we all know what comes after that:*\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/2pb2k9qv63j71.jpg?width=358&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0fe0cfb61c4db4c8c26fc5a464b8f25319b6e59c\n\nThis represents what Buffet called \u201cA Time Bomb\u201d in the market - as long as money flows in, the party continues. Once it stops, the Weapons of Financial Destruction are unleashed. As you may remember, something like that happened in 2008, when predatory lending targeting low-income homebuyers, excessive risk-taking by global financial institutions,\n\n[And when I leverage like x1.5, I GUH straight away, so unfair!](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/xct7amb273j71.png?width=1619&format=png&auto=webp&s=31b3738202cdc6b3cc7de9692d5b60643a906309)\n\nand the burst of the US housing bubble culminated in a perfect shitstorm. MBSs (Mortgage Backed Securities) tied to American real estate, as well as a vast web of linked to those MBSs CDOs, collapsed in value. As a result, financial institutions worldwide suffered severe damage, the GDP contracted sharply, the unemployment rates rose significantly, pushing millions of people into poverty - largely because some greedy bastards who had too much of financial power based on over-abused leverage and close to zero risk management made all the wrong decisions they could.\n\nThanks God, they promised not to do that again!\n\n[The scene is from \u2018Inside Job\u2019 movie, a bright reminder of what\u2019s going to happen again, soon.](https:\/\/reddit.com\/link\/pa03sf\/video\/1rflh5jy33j71\/player)\n\n\\*\\*In Tyler\u2019s voice\\*\\* So that was a fucking lie:\n\n[Sauce: OCC's quarterly report on bank trading and derivaives, Q1 2021](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/f9xgxitt73j71.jpg?width=2224&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3ccec798f35738ffb3435312c556fcd18646e6bd)\n\nThe figures above provide the relatively up-to-date exposure of the the biggest commercial banks towards derivatives. Although, we shouldn\u2019t expect that those numbers allow to calculate somewhat precise leverage ratios, inasmuch as many of these derivative obligations net each other out, rendering the real value of the debt to be a bit more modest (or maybe not, who knows what\u2019s really going on OTC). What is safe to assume, however, is that based on the numbers above, the leverage ratio is still in double digits at least for the biggest and most systemically important banks. From the recent infamous Archegos example, we saw that playing with leverage-amplifying synthetic market instruments (total return swaps in Bill Hwang\u2019s case) is like playing with matches - and it will almost certainly lead to dire consequences at some point in time. Poor Bill just was the first one to run out of luck.\n\nAnother important factor to bear in mind, is that those professional financial ANALysts seem to follow a similar risks assessment approach that is used by an average WSB retard buying FDs. No, I\u2019m not kidding, they literally stick to a bit more sophisticated version of a famous postulate: \u2018Stonks only go up\u2019. We are talking about VaR, or Value at Risk models. u\/peruvian_bull managed to explain this complex stuff in a brilliant way in his series of posts dedicated to the highly probable upcoming financial market fiasco (fascinating reading - in this part of the series, 1987 famous crash is discussed and how derivatives and improper risks assessment exacerbated it):\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/zfh3tjyk83j71.jpg?width=1507&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fb308013aac7d7c65f8cbf5130cf7a5d7abf2373\n\n>Even to this day, Regulators, and indeed even financial industry insiders, are completely blind to the risk. OTC Derivatives are essentially unregulated - NO ONE knows the true size of this market. Worse yet, the traders inside the bank are using optimistic versions of the Efficient Market Hypothesis and VaR models to estimate their risk, which comes out to essentially 0 due to the risk models and net exposure hedging. Thus, they pile on more risk every day, ensuring that this problem continues to grow - until the entire system explodes.\n\n  \nNo wonder, that in such a financial environment as described above, cases like GME would be given a five-sigma label. The best analogy to describe current financial market conditions would be a castle made of sand, when one sea wave of a higher magnitude can easily crash the whole thing into the dirt; or a house of cards, when just one stronger blow of the wind will trigger a chain reaction and demolish it to the fundament. The current status quo is not self-sustainable, and very soon it will become also a not FED-sustainable. The markets have been artificially supported by the money supply expansion for too long, currently resembling a drugs addict, who can\u2019t live without the always following stimulus \u201cdose\u201d. As soon as liquidity dries up for a brief moment (sucked in by some negative beta bad boy), or the FED blinks... I guess, we\u2019ll find out really soon what happens then.\n\nTo conclude and sum up the second chapter, quoting u\/peruvian_bull again:\n\n>**As long as money keeps flowing into the Casino, the gamblers feel little risk, so no one pulls out. The Fed continues to print money, equity\/bond prices continue to rise, and since there\u2019s \u201cno risk\u201d of the underlying falling in value, everyone keeps their money in the pot, and the poker game continues.**  \n>  \n>**The profits made from derivatives trading are enormous, and any bank that stopped doing this would quickly lose investors, because they would instantly take their capital out and take it to another bank that actually is profitable. It's all a confidence game - as long as everyone is confident, prices keep rising, and the cash keeps pumping in, the party will continue.**\n\n# \n\n# Chapter III. The Sword of Damocles (and the bet)\n\n  \nWell, here comes the party pooper, or it\u2019s more appropriate to say, the party shitter:\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/nw7vw0dk93j71.png?width=1860&format=png&auto=webp&s=7add7132ece80231f1451c88ba69ed3edd3878c7\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ebo8be5r93j71.png?width=1862&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d68afe9f815a7723b6058a24db193828b419282\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/kqwqmy9t93j71.png?width=1860&format=png&auto=webp&s=1618e8580829574b8f3df117d5e837287e043405\n\nConnecting the dots: when there is too much risk in the system, it becomes less and less sustainable, so that potentially even a short but sudden and intense surge in volatility may demolish the whole house of ~~leverage~~cards. Anything may cause a fatal error in such a system, even an old man\u2019s fart with the sigma of five. In our example however, it\u2019s when crazy retail jumps on the hype train, and buys over-shorted stonk like there\u2019s no tomorrow, things look like this:\n\n* GME shares added more than 500% in less than two days, showing off its negative beta in all glory,\n* making VIX volatility index explode more than 60% in a day,\n* and injuring SPY badly (sharp decline of about 4% in 21 hours).\n\nThat was just a preview.\n\nLate January events are extraordinary, that\u2019s for sure. But, you know, extraordinary things happen too, and it\u2019s plainly stupid not to hedge in such circumstances, as Robbinhood did in this story. That was a vivid example of an extremely poor risk management, prevalent on the financial markets currently. This factor, coupled with the excessive margin exploitation (e.g. a fucking reported triple digits SI, dafuq?), will consequently result in the financial crisis, which is currently on its way (remember, crises love September and October).\n\nAfter a rather fascinating set of circumstances, GME situation seems to have become the needle to burst the bubble, that\u2019s why big financial boys use all of their dirty tricks, flirting with an illusion of a controllable chaos. However, any manipulation has its end, and it is a double edged sword (of Damocles). The market will punish the bad actors, as it has always done so in the past - and the good guys will be remunerated. Again, GME is not the reason of the upcoming market crash, but rather a trigger, and in the current financial environment anything could work as a substitute. What was that quote from the \u2018Butterfly Effect\u2019 movie? Oh,  \n\n\n>It has been said that something as insignificant as the gases emitted from an anus of an old man can ultimately cause a financial typhoon all around the world...\n\n**Enough words and quotes. This is my bet: GME to thousands in a couple of months, while the new financial crisis unveiling, or I\u2019m not only shaving off my beard (which I wasn\u2019t really afraid of loosing, tbh, as it would grow back in a couple of months) but also this, my real treasure:**\n\nhttps:\/\/reddit.com\/link\/pa03sf\/video\/m0gwzvob43j71\/player\n\n**And here is why I\u2019m so confident in my bet and its timing:**\n\n[SPY daily chart](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/w51ks5l2b3j71.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7c7374f9a4f3d991386a6fea8c6b66108354d8f4)\n\nI mean, SPY is cooked. What's outlined on the TA above is a massive bearish formation, ready to push the market off the cliff it has been climbing all this time. In my opinion, that's going to be just the first wave of the nasty downside movement, and a very sharp and painful one. Considering the longer term setup, explained [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/mwevzz\/the_big_short_20_why_bears_may_soon_reconsider\/), and [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/o0fjdb\/this_time_its_different\/), the technical (as well as fundamentals, as discussed above) conditions resemble the perfect storm brewing. Now, while it's all calm before that storm, enjoy the last sunny and warm days (and, maybe, it's a good idea to fix some profits, dunno). September and October will be fun. Especially for GME with its negative beta.\n\n[VIX daily chart](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/mcg9etbeh3j71.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=728359435209bdb792327427e3cea524528d6908)\n\n[GME daily chart, log scale](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/xbskfzdkh3j71.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3c2451c6bc584e43f1497d8ca6acc141cb8e21d4)\n\n**TL;DR: My SS thesis and its core idea is more than alive with GME (proven by AMC example), and even though any major price action movement has been suppressed in an attempt to keep things under control by big financial players, the buying pressure is there and it's as strong as it has ever been. The financial system is over-levereged, way more than it was in 2008, and coupled with the industry poor risk assessment standarts ('average WSB retard'-like or worse), it is heading to the next financial crisis (and crashes love autumn). This factor, considering GME's negative beta, will likely trigger the next powerful bull run for GME, sucking in the liquidity from the fearful and already-illiquid markets, resulting in colossal volatility typhoon. Either that, or I'mma be completely bold this winter.**",

AMC is not GameStop \u2013 GameStop is led by a visionary CEO and actually has a viable path towards transforming itself. AMC, on the other hand, is stuck with its old CEO and management team and faces significant revenue cannibalization from home streaming services (which has been exacerbated by the pandemic).**\n\nIntroductory Disclosure: \n\nEven though I reference GameStop (GME), I do not advocate buying shares in GME. I also do not hate AMC or think anyone who bought AMC is foolish. I have been invested in both stocks. With this post, I am trying to be as objective and helpful as possible. \n\nMany of you may consider me a shill because I do not share all your opinions and\/or urge you to hold AMC until the stock reaches some non-sensical price target.  That is fine.  But I am definitely not a shill per the actual definition of the word in that I am not an accomplice to anyone. \n\nI invest money for a living and have run my own investment fund for over a decade. It\u2019s not a huge hedge fund like Citadel, but I have outside investors. I also have a lot of my own money in my investment fund. I have no special agenda other than making money for myself and my investors. I also do not have special access to regulators, AMC or other large investment funds including hedge funds, short-oriented or otherwise.  I hardly ever speak with other portfolio managers. I can\u2019t manipulate stocks (I wish I could, legally of course). If you imagine the equity market as every casino in the world, maybe Citadel is MGM Resorts, and I\u2019m just a card shark counting cards at the blackjack table. \n\nWe do a lot of research on our positions. I am here to share some of that research for no other reason than I find this community fascinating. I like underdogs. I often root for them.  But, to be clear, I\u2019m just trying to make money and have recently invested based on this diligence. Specifically, I am long AMC puts.\n\n**The AMC Short Squeeze is Over**\n\nI joined Reddit during the GME short squeeze. To be sure, it was a great way to make money. GME had over 100% short interest when Ryan Cohen joined the Board, so it appeared to many that the short squeeze was going to happen. Good for everyone that saw it early. \n\nThe GME short squeeze really did happen. GameStop traded to over $450 per share. Then the squeeze abruptly came to an end when GME\u2019s short interest declined to less than 10% of shares outstanding. Stock borrow rates collapsed in tandem. The stock dropped to $40 per share and the short squeeze was over. As many of you put it, the squeeze was squeezed. That part of the trade had concluded. \n\nAMC also experienced a squeeze, or more accurately, the perception that a squeeze could happen. Rapid and sustained buying caused share volumes to explode and the stock price to appreciate quickly (we think this may have been ignited by unusually large call option buying).  Hedge funds who were short needed to post 5-10x the collateral previously required to hold a short AMC position. Buyers, including and maybe especially retail traders, continued to overwhelm sellers. As that occurred at the end of May and early June, AMC shares ran up to $72 per share. Wave after wave of retail buyer piled in hoping to make life-changing money.  Some did.  \n\nThe problem is the squeeze (or, more accurately, the perception of the squeeze) ended, and now the stock is drifting lower every day. The amount of AMC shares short relative to its market cap and trading volume has never been that high and is currently declining. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/kuyjlumh0zd71.png?width=458&format=png&auto=webp&s=7af96d60af7932c3117851ae40d9cdad8b988d29\n\nBorrow rates are consequently diminishing as well - shorting doesn't cost that much anymore (less than 2% per year) and there is plenty of borrow available. If you need to cover your short, you can do so pretty easily. For example, if you\u2019re short 1 million shares, you can cover that before breakfast with recent trading volumes and it wouldn\u2019t move the stock at all. Remember, covering a short is simply buying shares in the market at the prevailing price. AMC trades over 50 million shares a day. People keep yelling \u201cthey have to cover!\u201d Or, \u201cwe own the float!\u201d Both of those things are true. But when someone wants to cover, they don\u2019t need to ask for everyone\u2019s permission. They just need to buy stock in the market at the current price much like people in this community buy stock every single day from people that are selling it. That\u2019s how it works.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/9lne56ti0zd71.png?width=458&format=png&auto=webp&s=fff4c1d06207b571e3adbc8f41d37149e149ec4a\n\nFinally, hedge funds that are short AMC are doing so in small size relative to the size of their funds. In other words, most are assuming over 200% price appreciation in their downside scenarios and have plenty of collateral in reserve to place against the short position they are maintaining if the short goes against them. For all intents and purposes, they can hold these short positions forever. This is not a recipe for a short squeeze.\n\n**AMC is not GameStop.** \n\nAfter the GME squeeze ended, GameStop continued transforming itself. GameStop raised a ton of cash ($500 million in April), paid down all its debt, and then raised even more cash ($1 billion in June). In the midst of cleaning up its capital structure, Ryan Cohen hired an experienced team of top-notch managers. GameStop (current market cap: $14.5 billion) now has a real shot at becoming a successful niche online retailer of gaming accessories and related products that competes effectively against Amazon. Investors are now betting that Ryan Cohen can make GameStop as successful as his last company Chewy (current market cap: $35 billion). Chewy captured market share from Amazon and others in the pet food and accessories market on its way to becoming a very large and thriving business.  Investors hope GameStop will do the same against Amazon, Best Buy and others.  \n\nThe value reflected in GameStop\u2019s current market cap is driven mostly by an optimistic bet on this transformation. The gamble on the short squeeze is over. GME is trading fairly rationally right now \u2013 maybe a little expensive considering the road to $35 billion is going to be really bumpy. GameStop\u2019s valuation is not completely detached from reality in that GameStop has a good chance at succeeding. \n\nAMC, on the other hand, has traded from the realm of the improbable into the universe of the impossible. AMC is stuck with its old management team and is pursuing the same tired strategy of trying to get people to fill theaters even though every content provider, including video game producers, are pushing consumers to enjoy and participate in content at home. AMC does not have Ryan Cohen. It has Adam Aaron who is struggling to steer AMC through $5 billion in debt and growing rent obligations. With this debt burden, and with zero history of being an entrepreneurial visionary like Ryan Cohen, Adam Aaron will not be able to attract the kind of talent Ryan Cohen can recruit. Consequently, AMC doesn\u2019t have a shot at competing against Disney, Netflix, Amazon and every other streamer. AA\u2019s only hope is to cynically appeal to apes so that you keep buying his stock. My bet is that he\u2019s going to have to deliver a lot more than free popcorn to keep people buying.\n\nBut enough of my opinions. Here are the facts. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/zia6u1mj0zd71.png?width=510&format=png&auto=webp&s=07ac2e7e676c7ffe15957086337e4174696b2c7b\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/wm4q3b4k0zd71.png?width=506&format=png&auto=webp&s=a03689104ff0bfabdaef53a94c12c7c2c75b13e6\n\nClearly, 2021 box office is well below 2018 box office on both a cumulative and weekly basis.  But yes, we are in a pandemic, and theaters are closed, so let\u2019s look at revenue per theater.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/f8fj54nk0zd71.png?width=506&format=png&auto=webp&s=d7bf2b12ff11fcd2d6bea2a4a6bc73a75e9d3701\n\nAlthough improving, 2021 box office per theater is well below 2018. Even last week, when Disney released its expected blockbuster Black Widow, box office per theater is well below 2018 levels.  The reason for this is actually pretty straightforward. The battle for viewers is no longer in the theater. It\u2019s at home. In 2018, Netflix, Hulu and Disney+ combined had 164 million subscribers. Now they have over 350 million. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/w1nawg2l0zd71.png?width=325&format=png&auto=webp&s=165d1c90746723ed10c03b1252323166110c854c\n\nThe major studios are no longer competing against each other. They are competing against Netflix and Amazon. In 2018, Netflix and Amazon produced 77 films. In 2020, they produced 145, most of which were never intended to be displayed in theaters. Amazon recently bought The Tomorrow War from Paramount for over $200 million. Rather than releasing it in theaters, Amazon digitally released it instead on Prime Video. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/nqxll5gl0zd71.png?width=328&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ceab142dbb333a09f82687d6307ad4b0c4a68a1\n\nA lot of Redditors say \u201cwell, AMC makes most of its money on concessions.\u201d That is actually not true. Over 62% of AMC\u2019s revenue and 48% of AMC\u2019s gross profit comes from actual ticket sales. Even if it were true, people need to visit theaters in order to buy popcorn and candy and soda, so tickets and concessions are joined at the hip. You can\u2019t have one without the other. \n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/0yakedbm0zd71.png?width=937&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0f523348018dc1ef621eadff4e7fcc8975c2e4c\n\n**Conclusion** \n\nI'm not telling you what to do. This isn't financial advice. I posted my research, my source data, and my position. I'm not replying to (or even reading) comments. If you have data that refutes any of this, post your own DD. If you're right, I hope people listen.\n\nGood luck!",

        "777":"For my GME Bull's! A closer look at Gamma Exposure  I agree that GME is getting close for  a rip. From a TA perspective, its trading in a high volume area. When I look at GME from a weekly time frame, Money Flow has been increasing over the last 4 weeks, this usually tells me its under accumulation. I saw this move in AMZN before it ripped. But as we all know, It is very difficult to time a move.\n\nSince Options dictate a lot of moves, I like to take look at how MM's are  positioned with GEX or known as Gamma Exposure. Gamma Exposure is really good if you like to sell options overall as it can provide information where Gamma Walls are at. Also can use it to know when to take profits. For example, on $DIS there is a Call Gamma Wall at 185. On Monday I took some profits on my calls since it is close to that PT.\n\nNow back to GME. We are currently in  neg gamma territory and under a put wall at 170. If we cant close above  this tomorrow, we could see 150 imo, the next high neg gamma area which I  believe should provide good support. But you can also see, a close over 200, Call Gamma Wall, can make it fly with little resistance above.

        "778":"GME SOTU and Technical Analysis: Crayons aren't only for eating, they're also for confirming bullish bias Greetings retards, autists and apes. Here to share my outlook and some very simple TA in way too many words that you don't know how to read which may have already been invalidated in after hours trading with the vanilla NFLX news. This is a fictional account and not investment advice.\n\n# Preface\n\nToday is Wednesday July 14th, 2021. As you can see, GME has been selling off on very low volume and really accelerated today, along with many other caca stocks that are starting to make their way back down to hell after a nice consolation bounce out of the May lows. Many will break May lows and never recover, FYI.\n\nGME is special, though, as it is the Queen of caca stocks standing steadfast beside King TSLA who retired from greatness after the SPX add and has a date with 400. For both, many would say they are not caca and have fundamental upside. Maybe they do, maybe they don't. What we do know is GME low float, high SI and is subject to gamma squeezes (helped by short covering) and that is what we are looking for come August to September as we watch for a pattern to repeat itself.\n\n# Where we are at\n\nToday just before close, GME found a potential bottom at 165 with huge volume which is peculiarly right where we have several supports:\n\n7) The positive trendline running from the extremely bullish engulfing candle just after the earnings gap down in March to the beginning of the breakout in May heading into Q2 ER.\n\n2) The all-time-highs AVWAP which basically encapsulates the average of volume and price since the day GME sent Gabe home crying. Like moving averages, above is bullish ( \ud83d\ude80 ) and below it is bearish (\ud83c\udf08).\n\n4) Thicc volume shelves from $100-150 where most volume has traded since January, indicating where traders have been interested in buying in the past, and where those who sold at highs or missed the boat the first time may find value in entering.\n\n6) 151 is a pivotal level related to some gamma\/greek mysticism. As we saw after hours today, price hit 151.01 and bounced for 9 pts. Below 151 is certain death, or possibly a 200-day MA test around 110 (orange line)\n\nNot only are we at these multiple, coinciding levels of support, we are in the midst of oversold territory with daily RSI at 33, its lowest reading since before most of you were born (April 3, 2020, $2.80 close). *An aside: What a long way GME has come to be knocking at the year-to-date RSI lows and closing at almost $168, OG GME bull* \/u\/Uberkikz11 *and the GMEdd team's bull case fair value target released on 1\/20\/21. Market weighing machine well at work. Cheers, Rod.*\n\nBut wait! There's more: While GME is in oversold territory, SPX and especially NQ\/FAGMAN are well overbought and starting to show weakness here at monthly OpEx with AAPL now carrying all of the weight. We've seen money flow to the safe haven of GME in times of hedging need. Should the indexes pull back starting as soon as tomorrow (Thursday 7\/15) or sometime next week, the money that was made dumping tech on retail at ATHs will find its way somewhere, and in the past it has been GME (and boomer value stocks). Watch AAPL weakness for clues.\n\nAll this being said, today I would put us at or around 3\/24 in the quarterly cycle. Especially with the NFLX news knocking us down even lower into oversold territory with support at 151, our capitulation may be in.\n\n# Where we are going\n\nAll these factors are indicating that, should patterns repeat, GME is ripe for a bounce in the near future, and it could be a nice 40-60 pt ripper up to resistance levels at the 20 or 50 day MAs around 200, or one of the other two swing high AVWAPs above (207, 235).\n\nAt the very least, from the after hours action we will open gapped-down with gap to fill at 167. Could fill now, could fill next week, could fill never.\n\nNow, I don't think we are going to see a breakout with continuation until we get to mid August, for another \\~4 week run up into earnings. As you can see between Q1-Q2 ER, we caught a 64 pt dragon dong oversold bounce out of the 3\/24 capitulation candle, and after that came two months of consolidation where GME was pinned in a relatively tight range in order to let IV die down, cheapen OTM calls for large in scale buying, and let shorts get comfy enough to catch them off guard.\n\n# GamePlan\n\n**Immediate term:** Watch price action tomorrow AM for a rip out of open which dips may be bought, or a sell at open to re-test 151, followed by a reversal on increased volume if 151 holds and shit starts hitting the fan on NQ\/SPX. If it doesn't reverse strongly but holds 151, look for basing to occur with more volume to come in possibly in the afternoon, eventually bringing volatile movements to the upside. The basing could take a while, might not start getting interesting until Friday afternoon into close.\n\nIF we don't get a strong reversal by end of this week, but hold 151, look for a dip-to-moon or rip straight out of the gates on Monday.\n\nTargets are the upper resistance levels 198, 209, 235. Don't be greedy.\n\nIF we lose 151, let it die some more. If you liked GME at 483, you'll love it in the low 100s. Don't try to catch the falling knife, you will get cut. Possible supports at 151, 137, 110, 48, 40. Wait for confirmation.\n\n**Earnings play:** Watch for price to consolidate for a few weeks after any bounce, identify the consolidation range and look for entries at the low end of the range around August OpEx 8\/20. Sell into strength BEFORE earnings.\n\n# Footnotes\n\nPositions: 7\/16 170c, 180c, 190c, 7\/23 190c. Be realistic with OTM calls. 800c will not print.\n\nObligatory rockets: \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nDisclaimer: This is for entertainment purposes only.

        "782":"The State of the Meme - a TA of all your favorite, amazing, can't possibly fail investments! (GME, AMC, BB, BBBY, CLOV, SPCE, RKT, WOOF) Did you come to Wallstreetbets today to read a novel? We'll you've come to right post, friend! This hot off the presses steaming pile of trash has it all: charts **and** text! With a side of **disappointment** and **shattered dreams**! All for the low price of wasting time you didn't need anyway!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Table of Contents:**\n\nPart 1. The Meme Demystified\n\nPart 2. The Meme Charts\n\n1. GME\n2. AMC\n3. BB\n4. BBBY\n5. CLOV\n6. SPCE\n\nPart 3. The U.S.S. Failboat\n\n1. RKT\n2. WOOF\n\nPart 4. The Week Ahead\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------\n\n**Part 1. The Meme Demystified**\n\nMy basic thesis for the meme stocks is that they are all following a relatively similar, and somewhat predictable pattern. There was a recent post here that claimed all the meme stocks were totally different plays. This is wrong. In fact, they are all basically the same play, with some variation. Here is a list of the essential elements of the meme stock pattern:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. **Memes**: This just boils down to retail attention; DDs, memes, ppl posting stupid yolos, etc.\n2. **Option wizardry**: Seeing there is a 'new thing' over on the ol' internets and it's going up, some big money motherfuckers starting buying call options in stupid quantities, forcing market makers to hedge, **the thing** then happens.\n3. **Diamond handing**: A bunch of idiots catch a case of FOMO and pile into the stock at terrible prices, then once they're sitting on devastating losses, they say to themselves: 'you know I *always* believed in this company' and promptly declare they are diamond handed apes, and they'll *never* sell.\n4. **Higher-low**: The refusal to sell by the ~~retards~~ brilliant new investors who see value that others don't, *causes* the rapidly falling stock price to stabilize at a new higher-low, proving the case that their diamond handing actually did something.\n5. Go back to 1 and repeat for another leg higher.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLooking at the charts in the next part, it's my contention that the higher-low should be at the same level the stock broke out of on the prior move. In other words: spike, drop to breakout, stabilize there, spike again, drop to second breakout, stabilize there, ... repeat until lambo.\n\nSPCE is an example of a case were the stock fell all the way back down after it's early year breakouts, but I'm not sure it ever properly fit the pattern.\n\n***There's no fucking pattern, dipshit. TA doesn't work on meme stocks! It's just randomness!!!!*** I hear you typing in your comment. I see a pattern in these moves. Further, the underlying mechanism of call option wizardry appears the same as well (GME, part 1, notwithstanding). As does the effect of diamond handing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------\n\n**Part 2. The Meme Charts**\n\nFirst, let me say the State of the Memes this week is **wounded**.  As the charts show, across the board (except SPCE) the whole of Memelandia got pretty well beat to shit.\n\nStarting with GME:\n\n[GME](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ukgcqozlnma71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c3c70553d72942ff2d3e936e46239c6df908ef6)\n\nGME has completed four rounds on the wheel of lambos. It is, like all the meme stocks, experiencing the early stages of a break down of the pattern. You can fiddle around with where you think Launch #4 should be drawn and put it around $195, then squint and turn you head a little to the right and everything will look just dandy.\n\nIs GME dead? No. Just wounded. Get back up into the Support Zone #4 and it's game on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNext AMC:\n\n[AMC](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/dbivb5gkoma71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=1766b652351e92f9201c28b4fef1031796eaaa32)\n\nAMC is that weird kid you went to school with. He was nice enough, but it was always a little awkward to hang out with him. Like you were never quite sure what he was going to do\/say next. The reason underlying this is likely the fact that y'all bought damn-near the whole company already.\n\nIs AMC dead? No. It's a weirdo that I expect should drop all the way back to $14.54 before finding support. But at this point it could literally do anything. (Except go up again. That's definitely not happening until we get some kind of consolidation ... somewhere.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEveryone's favorite Canadian, BB:\n\n[Oh, Canada!](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/6haay06epma71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=52acbe79317f76bf4a9e43636c87a34890197c38)\n\nNot too shabby, not too great. Like the last girl you took home from the bar. You didn't have to get *that* drunk to make the call, but you weren't going to pick her sober.\n\nIs BB dead? No. We've broken under Support Zone #3 (or #2, if you don't want to count the Dec jump as a proper meme launch). However, we haven't completely collapsed, and if you know anything about TA, you know that you can just redraw the lines to reinforce that poorly thought out decision you made when you entered the position in the first place.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGreat bedside table selection, BBBY:\n\n[I really like these bedside tables... that I got from Wayfair.](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/e0d1mj63qma71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3cefbc8df2ff395550d482556355d6bc7f8fe17)\n\nNobody talks about this ticker any more, but it actually looks like its in the best shape of the bunch.\n\nIs BBBY dead? Absolutely not. In fact, I'm thinking of using margin to hop aboard (cause almost all my money is tied up ~~bagholding~~ *with a long term investment in* CLOV). It found support this week right where it was supposed to and it ended the week with green candles. Maybe being forgotten about around here is a good thing.....\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLeprechaun 8, The Night of Broken Dreams, CLOV:\n\n[I might have to visit a church..... how much do favors from Jesus cost, anyway?](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/9swz2j03rma71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6333324df38e3cf30320f0b63f85547e0caead6)\n\nI'm really, really, *really*, hoping my thesis that the price needs to stabilize at the previous breakout point is wrong. Or that I'm drawing the breakout lines wrong. Or that Buddy Jesus is going to forgive me for all those hookers and all that cocaine. I'm sorry, okay!\n\nIs CLOV dead? No, but it just got kicked straight in the nuts and is lying on the ground writhing in pain wondering why a girl that likes you would kick you in the balls to show that she likes you. The $9 mark is basically the last hope. Unless you want to look to SPCE for your comparison (but that's just cherry picking charts to find one that helps you sleep at night; you know, standard practice for TA)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRocketman, Sir Big-balls Branson, SPCE:\n\n[Expect more rockets](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/s8t2qm06sma71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed9ab72b20cd2f0662e9d3c64168c98454a63bc5)\n\nI'm not convinced this chart belongs with the others, but I squinted really hard and kinda sorta see how it might fit the pattern. There is just so much extra going on with SPCE that it is not going to play nice for TA.\n\nIs SPCE dead? Of course not. Branson survived, and that means SPCE is going to be just fine. Still, I think a retrace back to \\~$40 looking for support would not be unwarranted.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------\n\n**Part 3. The U.S.S. Failboat**\n\nThis is by no means an exhaustive list of the failures, but RKT and WOOF stand out to me as examples of Team Fail.\n\nFirst, the not-rocketman, RKT:\n\n[This is not the way to the moon](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/kbsinyb3tma71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=db532489fb141a71183654af327c744cb68851d8)\n\nNo matter how you redraw my breakout line, this is a clear fail. In fact, after the push up, the stock put in an all-time **low**. That is not how you get a lambo.\n\nIs RKT dead? As a meme stock, yes. Dead and buried. As a long term investment? I could see the case for it, I guess...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnlike, WOOF, which is just hot garbage blended into your dog's food:\n\n[Rocket ship to the Center of Earth. That's where the adventure is!](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/zw4u0u7mtma71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce8e9394e6f4be03d1cfddee607d7de0bbb93cb7)\n\nCan you even say this was *ever* a meme stock, proper? I don't think so. This is P&D action.\n\nIs WOOF dead? In all ways, yes. Wasn't there a pet company during the dotcom bubble that went tits up....? Some lessons need to be learned twice it seems.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------\n\n**Part 4. The Week Ahead**\n\nAs I said at the beginning of Part 2, the State of the Meme is **wounded**. Last week's action was bad, across the board for everyone not in SPCE (or somehow, someway, for reasons I'll never understand, holding NEGG....). It's not over yet, though. Wounded is not dead. Hell, even dead can just be *mostly* dead. That's what the Princess Bride taught me, and I've learned everything I know from movies, so it must be true.\n\nHowever, a stand **must** be made. A line in the sand **must** be drawn. Someone, somewhere, needs to stand up and say **enough is enough**. We are ~~human beings~~ *just oversized children* god-damnit!\n\nIf we have another week of across the board bleeding, shit has the potential to go south, and fast. On top of it, this coming week has a bunch of options expiring because monthlys. Expect maximum pressure. When you've got your opponent on his back foot, you don't let off, you hit harder. If they smell blood in the water--and the charts look to me like blood in the water--they are going to try to finish the job and obliterate the Defenders of Memelandia once and for all.\n\nDo I honestly think the whole of \"the Suits\" is some cabal that would like to see this crazy ass party stop? No. I'm quite sure a bunch of them are on the long-side of these moves. They ***are*** the Options Wizards. But there are definitely some that want this boat roll over and if it looks like they can do it, then they go for it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Good luck, and may the lambos be with you.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPositions or ban:\n\n[CLOV & F, a fateful pairing....](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/dhka7jy0yma71.jpg?width=1921&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ee57b075cdaafef09b519b1491e6d911d60f2aa3)\n\nEdits for spelling\/grammar, because OCD.",

Have I been guilty of this in the past? Absolutely. In my post history you\u2019ll definitely find me shilling for CLOV. Stupid piece of shit CLOV. \n\nTurns out, you\u2019ll find most of these stocks are shorted FOR A REASON. THEY SUCK ASS. THINK YOU DAMN APES, THINK. \n\nAMC and GME actually did squeeze. But those are RARE exceptions. And they totally poisoned this sub with a bunch of Neanderthals looking for the next short squeeze. Stop. Get help. It feels like we\u2019ve had 5 years worth of short squeezes in the last few months. It\u2019s over. \n\nWhy should you listen to a random nobody yelling at you on the internet? Because. People are making money out there while you baghold these crap stocks. SPY at an all time high. You coulda made more $$ playing Microsoft or Apple. \n\nOr actually, don\u2019t stop. Lose your money please. And then fuck off to your lonely 9-5 daily cocksucking for that $500 weekly paycheck. And never come to this sub again. So I don\u2019t have to read your bullshit. I just want to wake up, pull out my phone, and not see your dumb ass. Your wife\/girlfriend however is invited. \n\nSo, want to know why your \u201cshort squeeze\u201d DD isn\u2019t working?! Here\u2019s the difference- AMC and GME are household names. If you want retail to pile on? It\u2019s gotta be a household name. Retail loves nostalgia. They love familiarity. \n\nSo is it a retail squeeze, or can you get the big bois on board? Here\u2019s some facts for ya- they don\u2019t need your shit DD. They have Bloomberg Terminals. They have 100x more data than we do, and they see it before we do, in real time, and they play market rotations and earnings. They\u2019re not googling 1 week old short interest data. They got the real time shit. They play this game on another level. And if you can\u2019t get them on board, and the stock isn\u2019t a household name, then you fucked up. \n\nSo this is what I\u2019m saying- I blame all you fucks for missing plays like NKE last week. \n\nCome on. NKE was a fucking given. It was written on the wall in neon letters and most of us missed it. \n\nTL;DR- want to make money? You can be a millionaire without ever touching a short squeeze. \n\nFucking rookie ass bitches.\n\nEDIT MOTHERFUCKERS- \n\nSomehow my rant, which I thought would get me banned or downvoted to hell, has made it to the top in just a few hours. \n\nSure, the comments are trying to wreck me. I also got a Reddit admin notice asking if I need mental health help lmao. Got a good chuckle out of that one. Fucking trolls. \n\nBut you can see this is a place where we can still say fuck this short interest bullshit. And we can still find others who agree. I\u2019m ok with conflict as long as nobody gets banned or their comments deleted. \n\nWhen you try to have a counter opinion on most subreddits you get insta-banned. So I\u2019m just happy we have some freedom to talk shit here and disagree openly. It\u2019s fun. Appreciate it you cunts. \n\nI know it won\u2019t stop the shilling but \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f. Let\u2019s get some real fucking DD in here. Fuck short squeezes. It\u2019s too easy for people to come in and manipulate this crowd on SI news.\n\nFINAL EDIT- mods flair me. What\u2019s it take? Who\u2019s dick I gotta suck?",

Both  amc and gme  will explode in a crash due to them having a negative beta , and negative beta stocks tend to do the opposite of the market , with the amount of volume we are seeing with amc we could see amc sky rocket and if that happens that will 100 percent cause hedge funds to cover their shorts , now with that being said do ur own DD but I believe holding amc or gme can save u from getting fuvked in a crash as this is the easiest money u will ever make , thank me later I\u2019m retarded so don\u2019t ask about punctuation or whatever",

I've lost thousands on PLTR but i'm still holding because the company is beyond incredible. One of the biggest questions i've seen that nobody truly understands is \"What is Palantir? What do they do?\", so let me attempt to explain wtf they do... Precursor, this isn't an in-depth analyses of PLTR fundamentals and financials. If you want to look at their fundamentals you can check some other dd like this [one](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/n9ydod\/palantirs_pltr_fundamentals_just_became_even\/). It's about a month old, but it's still incredibly relevant now. This post is meant to address the general question of what PLTR is as a company, what they do, and bring some general attention to the interesting options volume this week.\n\n*This is not financial advice. Do your own research!!! The more research i did in PLTR the more bullish i became.*\n\n# TL;DR\n\n\\- PLTR visualizes abstract data in a meaningful way for any business to easily analyze and efficiently run their business.\n\n\\- PLTR is a modular system that allows for companies to connect with each other seemlessly creating an interconnected community for data to travel which will create waves in how business is conducted.\n\n\\- PLTR is an engineering master piece that is incredibly unique.

I'm a programmer and even i don't fucking get it. Well all became clear after the [demo day](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=EFP3sBQfaww) came out, where finally PLTR showcased their platforms which people are sleepin on. Before we can answer what PLTR is, we need to answer \"what is data\"? Data is the logical representation of the real world. Any largescale business will always collect a ton of data most often stored in texts such as spreadsheets or databases (which requires programming knowledge to navigate through). So what does PLTR do with this data? Well they consolidate a company's data and displays it in a comprehensible easily digestible UI for the company to use. (Note that they take company's data, PLTR doesn't gather or store any data of it's own) Easy right? This allows for pretty much any company\/organization like [the CDC for medicine](https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/palantir-to-help-u-s-track-covid-19-vaccines-11603367276), the [military for national security](https:\/\/www.palantir.com\/palantir-gotham\/21-launch\/), and the [stock market for financial fraud](https:\/\/twitter.com\/PalantirTech\/status\/1399747624463486986) (stock market is only rumors for now but hopefully PLTR HELP US FIND THE HEDGIES THAT MANIPULATE THE MARKET) . But how insane is this? Working with that much data is a nightmare. In a society where data is already a necessity, being able to look through and analyze data quickly for any anomalies or patterns is crucial to any company and is often overwhelming. With PLTR a normal non-technical operator can click their computer to pull up an order, or an issue that PLTR detected, make any changes and or notify whoever needs the attention. Let's take the CDC for example. When the vaccine rolled out, PLTR had a huge hand in this. PLTR gives visual display of where the vaccine is going, how many, and any issues that has risen if any, allowing for fast response time. You can imagine PLTR displaying a map with the various routes to different deployment sites with pictures of a little truck representing the shipments being routed to their destination. An operator can click 1 of these shipments\/routes and pull up any data of that specific point. With data being displayed and organized in this way it makes it easy to analyze data, where are things going, what kind of picture does the data represent, rather than staring at a spreadsheet of numbers. Now this is just an example, PLTR is general enough and customizable enough where it can represent any business\/organization's structure. Once data is organized it opens up the possibility for even further opportunities such as creating simulations of potential issues that can happen in order to forsee and plan for various situations. It allows data to be clean enough to train machine learning algorithms (a big problem with ML is that data isn't clean or has weird edge cases that fucks up the model. If you talk to any data\/ml engineer they will typically mention most of their job is cleaning data over actual application). Companies can create scripts or AI to respond to events if needed. It can be as simple as notifying an executive if an issue occurs, or completely issuing a rollback order if there's a sudden spike of side effects for the covid vaccine which will be represented in the data. It's the ultimate data representation\/analysis platform that any company can utilize and it's fucking insane, i still casn't believe PLTR managed to do this. But it brings up a few problems.\n\n# Why Palantir?\n\nWhy can't companies just create their own platform? Because it's expensive, time consuming, and complicated. A common issue large companies have is simply having too much data. Take the automotive industry for example and self driving. Driving data needs to be collected and stored for AI. That's a lot of data... like pentabytes of data if not more.... Now let's say there's data being collected in America, the signs and the messages on side walks, are different than those that are in the UK. If you have a dataset from the UK well that data comes with it's own issues and rules, this creates a problem called \"data silos\" meaning data is separated into it's own little circle separated from other data silos. If the company decides to make a platform to analyze these 2 different types of data, they will have to consolidate, organize, and create 2 kinds of platforms for it. Now this example is only 2, large businesses have dozens of data silos that are often abandoned or isolated. PLTR is a generalized platform that encompasses any and all kinds of data which they themselves work closely with companies in order to cater to what they need. Why can't companies create a general platform themselves? Because it's an engineering nightmare and PLTR is an engineering masterpiece.... It is so insanely difficult to create something general enough to fit any and all data... but PLTR has done exactly that. The best comparison i can correlate this to is computers. Before generalized computers, computers would be built and deployed to do 1 job and 1 job only. Once generalized computers came out it's used everywhere and no company develops their own computer for a single job, they go out and buy a computer, in this case, any company that manages data can benefit from PLTR.\n\nAnother benefit we see from PLTR is that PLTR is 1 huge modular system. If a person from 1 company wants to share data with another company that utilizes PLTR they can do so seemlessly. PLTR talks with each other and easily sends data to and from. Imagine if hospitals or universities adapted this system. You no longer have to manually print a transcript and submit it to the other university's administration and then wait for it to be processed for a few days. If your medical records are stored in 1 hospital and you get sent to the ER in another hospital, your main hospital can send your medical records to the ER you're at seemlessly and quickly. Its insane how misunderstood PLTR is, but it's a far reaching company that will dig into the roots of all whether you jump into it or not, all i'm doing is trying to have it move sooner than later. Deep roots are not reached by the forst.\n\nKarp is a giga chad. Fucking guy got the intelligence of Elon Musk if not more, and the hair to fucking prove it. If you want to witness it first hand, listen to some of his[interviews](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=hjjHdys2Ph4). A lot of his philosophies are amazing and I believe in his abilities to make PLTR go to the moon. \ud83c\udf11\ud83c\udf11\ud83c\udf11\n\nIf anyone's worried that the military may drop PLTR, [here ya go](https:\/\/www.defensenews.com\/land\/2019\/03\/29\/palantir-who-successfully-sued-the-army-just-won-a-major-army-contract\/).\n\n# Why now?\n\nI did a DD on AMC a week ago calling the rally from $20 -> $70. Will the same happen with PLTR? **It can** but it'll need some help. Not gonna explain how the squeeze works as it's beyond the scope of this post. If you want check out the [DD i did on AMC](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/nqa5x8\/why_amc_is_rallying_and_why_it_will_continue\/), i explain the idea there.\n\n[PLTR Option Chain from Yahoo Finance](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/e10egiyiac571.png?width=1363&format=png&auto=webp&s=db92a97940da7189c65e524fe3e6595c70eb638e)\n\nfucking options volume is even higher than AMC when i did AMC's DD. Now PLTR has a larger market cap than AMC so we probably won't see a run up as large as AMC but it's still a great stock with great opportunity. If we can get enough people to get on PLTR it can definitely pop. The options volume is spread out very nicely through the 20-30 range which is perfect for launching the price forward. Meme stocks typically has a second coming. GME had a 2nd wind, BB had a 2nd wind, AMC's 2nd wind is nuttier than it's first one ffs, it looks like it's about time for PLTR to have it's 2nd wind, but it needs more attention.\n\n# Why not AMC\/GME\/BB\/etc?\n\n**I love memes and have made a lot of money off memes.** As much as I love AMC and GME, I sold at the top. I sold AMC at 70, and i sold GME at 400. Why? **Because Meme stocks need to cool down**. This isn't because of hedgies or any kind of attacks. Stocks that are very volatile causes their options to be ridiculously expensive, which prevents the potential for a rally from happening because it's much harder for people to buy in options. Ultimately I don't want to be a bag holder, and i don't want others to be bag holding (rip GME 400$ holders and AMC 70$ holders). Everyone should look for selling opportunities, for GME it was RH closing down and AMC was when the rally ran it's course. (Check the AMC DD above if you need proof, i updated the post as soon as i sold at $70. GME unfortunately I have no proof for) I will still look for opportunities to buy into GME\/AMC again once it's cooled down a bit but for now, PLTR is really cheap, volatility is really low, and we're sitting at the floor right now with huge potential for it to explode. People have been burnt before when PLTR was cooling off from the past, but now **the second coming is near....** We're at the floor right now so if the narrative doesn't play out it's also just a great stock to hold.\n\n# Reversal\/Exit\n\nUnfortunately PLTR doesn't have the same attention as AMC did when i wrote the last DD, so in order for it to pop off this week PLTR will need some love. Even if not enough people realizes how amazing it actually is then it'll just sit steady and grow over time. For PLTR i don't really have an exit. If it does rally i will sell and let it cool, but i'll update this post if that happens. If that doesn't ever happen, then i'll just keep PLTR as a long term hold, and re-allocate funds to riskier plays based on my risk tolerance and when opportunity arises. Other than that I'm more than happy to hold PLTR for years to come. PLTR already has pretty much everything i own right now... All my money, my commitment, my wife... o\\_o PLTR is my wife's boyfriend.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Position**:\n\n4250 shares at $23.32\n\n40x $27 calls 7\/9\n\n10x $30 calls 7\/9\n\n(I do think PLTR will moon sooner, sometime within the week with enough attention but I don't want to get dicked by Theta so i bought calls a bit further out.

        "796":"LAST CHANGE GME Gap Fill Incoming First let me start out by saying I'm an APE who eats crayons but had to post this because this spot right here is the biggest, rarest, and last opportunity we apes have to buy in at these cheap prices. WallStBets know that if they let GME drop, from this spot here, the entire meme frenzy will die. This is 100% the next rip. Also, I absolutely hate fundamentals but this isn't a play based on that, but rather based on the momentum. Old heads don't see that and are still buying shares of the DOW on their quotrons.\n\nNow, let's look at the technicals. Here's where shit gets interesting...\n\n**PRICE ACTION** First off, we need to analyze the price action of GME and right off the bat we see a MASSIVE gap right at $305. Short sellers came in right at the $350 mark and beat it down because if it blew the top off this daily resistance at $326-350, we will absolutely moonshot to $400+. That is if however we transition from these irrelevant CLOV and BB stocks and roll over our gains into GME.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/jpo9521b6o471.png?width=1048&format=png&auto=webp&s=87f7400664a94226b38f8a05473aedfa4c5732b2\n\nAlso, RSI starting to taper. Historically GME has sold off after every earnings call for the past two years so I'm not surprised to see a dip right here. The thing is however that GME absolutely crushed earnings. The previous gap at $210 just filled and we needed that in order to make a higher low.\n\n**FIBS** This spot right here is the single greatest Fib retracement I have ever seen. Hovering right at .618 otherwise known as the \"Golden Trade\". The support level we are bouncing off is in line with the fib levels almost to a T, so we can expect a reversal is coming.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/lzanblgd6o471.png?width=2966&format=png&auto=webp&s=00a00856592e36dd8117faeec6d5d2defc56a5f6\n\n**OPTION VOL** Now the icing on the cake is the option volatility that is absolutely sky rocketing. You can see the slight dip in call vol when we had the fat dip and see it start to pick up when we hit the golden fib ratio and set the gap at 310. Let's also look at the put volatility which has been linear. This is due to the Hedge Funds shorting the fuck out of this stock doing everything they can not to let the redditors and tards win. Options contracts are expiring on friday and are being rolled over, so on monday we will see a new wave of price fluctuation and option pricing where the contracts for next week will begin to drop. If my theory is correct, more buyers will jump in at the cheaper call prices when GME is pumped on market open on monday when it starts looking to fill the $310 gap.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ddyujvsf6o471.png?width=3554&format=png&auto=webp&s=61100491a89df316ba04aa8814d94fe9c1695138\n\n**PC RATIO** Put call ratios look overall bullish and this call option right here stands out. a $4,000,000 call in July? That's big money and while these big institutions are shorting, the smaller guys and smaller firms are pouring money in. You can see that there are a couple of multi-million dollar call spreads and naked calls. The problem here is that your average tard doesn't have $3000+ for a naked call so that's why cheaper contracts will fill the gap.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/d33w9csi6o471.png?width=3554&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6a5cfbbd65b91f320a5577194e229b049ca6d48\n\nIf you believe in the technical analysis and the fuck fundamentals revolution of stocks happening right now, this could be the biggest trade of the year. WallStBets is an organization that I believe will not go down without a fight, and I see them planning a massive rally with GME through their instagram and twitter pages. What you apes don't understand is that there is a hierarchy to everything, and the organizers of WallStBets are absolutely BANKING on the shit that is ripping. A lot of the retards buying can barely navigate this subreddit and see \"BUY GME CANNOT GO TITS UP\" on the front page and just let er rip with a $500 call on their Robinhood account expiring next week. At the end of the day, do your own due diligence. The stock is cheap right now and I'm definitely buying. I believe in WallStBets and I think this is only the beginning of the meme stock revolution, and that these events will be engraved in financial history. This cannot go tits up ;) Not financial advice don't wanna get sued. I'm gonna go back to eating crayons now since my lunch at Arby's is almost over.",

        "799":"GME to AMC and BB last week: \u2018Ladies go first!\u2019 GME soon: \u2018Hold my beer, bitches!\u2019 Greetings, honourable intellectually gifted fellow WSB participants. It\u2019s crayons drawing Roman here, and this time I brought you a fascinating technical thesis I would like to hear your opinion about!\n\nImportant notice to be made: this is a motherfucking super duper risky play, and you will most definitely lose a lot of money, if not all, if you follow it, especially via FDs. So don\u2019t fucking follow it, you fucking donkey! Rather, treat it as a technical hypothesis, or a fun TA brain candy - and tell me what you think, I\u2019d like to gather some sweet retarded feedback.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/kjo0vjdoah471.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8c8a2e3bcc54035412afdb6ea5cba9d21f91e31c\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/2ubr6zypah471.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=38830e5af516fe0ab5d8c9f6824f91d6f0a6bd65\n\nWithout further ado, let\u2019s get to the business: the first thing to look at, is a beautiful triangular wedge formation at the core of each chart. WSB loves triangles, and this love has a fair justification. Triangles incarcerate the flattening of the price action accompanied by diminishing volatility - for the price action subsequently to make a fucking explosion, should the triangle be broken out. The perfect example of that is AMC\u2019s price action after the breakout. \\[Juicy is what juicy does\\]([https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/nfaizr\/amc\\_looking\\_juicy\\_next\\_resistance\\_targets\\_1623\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/nfaizr\/amc_looking_juicy_next_resistance_targets_1623\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)), what else can I say.\n\nAs you may observe, GME has a very similar triangular technical formation at its core, which has been broken out in a similar to AMC nature. Since the two stonks are short squeeze brothers in arms (...Dire Straits starts playing) and have been moving according to linear correlation for a considerable period of time, imho, it\u2019s fair to assume that GME should catch its brother in arms up at some point in the near future, and this is the main assumption that I base my thesis on. \n\nSo far so good, now take a look at those Fibo levels: the AMC retracement is applied from Jan apex (premarket 4h chart high, looks like a gap on daily) to the subsequent low during the local accumulation phase. Thereafter, the following extended Fibo levels are highlighted and are of the prior significance for the price action: 1.414, 2, 2.618, 3.272. Those same levels are used to identify the potential GME crucial resistances, and Fibo is applied accordingly.\n\nAnother thing that supports the thesis of GME AMC-rocket-like movement is magenta highlighted patterns on MACD, which look like fucking twins on the two stonks.\n\nAnd the last but not least, take a look at this fascinating momentum visualisation: True Strength Indicator. AMC looks a bit exhausted, while GME has a lot of potential unrealised upside steam under the hood (fat magenta rectangle).\n\nOverall, the TA picture for GME looks nice and juicy to me, what do you think?\n\nLove you and fuck you with all of my heart,\n\nRoman, aka TA degenerate.\n\nOh, and this is a closeup of the price action after the breakout. *Thinking of a spot on metaphor...* The things look as similar as my left and right testicle:\n\n[AMC](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/3fgyr3zhah471.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a4701c608c386223824d143c9e254d858894db33)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[GME](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/sxymaf3kah471.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f876de00fb46e79f783756ab5bd7b0fe6f41f0f3)",

        "808":"You are the product The surge of trading in offbeat stocks is duping inexperienced investors in to high costs and a battle with Wall Street that they cannot win, according to the founder of one of the largest trading firms in the world.\n\nZero-commission trading helps to build an illusion that amateur investors have never had it better, Alex Gerko, co-chief executive of London-based XTX Markets, told the Financial Times in an interview.\n\nBut the way retail brokerages sell on their customers\u2019 orders and a \u201cvery poor benchmark\u201d mean that the smallest investors together shell out billions of dollars in hidden costs every year when buying or selling US equities, he explained.\n\n\n\u201cThe GameStop episode made it obvious that the retail part of the market is particularly broken,\u201d Gerko said, referring to the huge spike in the console store chain\u2019s shares in January. \u201cThe incentives are there to create a lot of churn in very illiquid stocks, which is exactly what we are seeing this year.\u201d\n\nOn the face of it, the GameStop frenzy was an unprecedented victory of young amateur traders over Wall Street professionals including some hedge funds that had been betting against the company. But Gerko thinks the reality is the opposite. \u201cIf you think of zero commissions, on paper it sounds great \u2014 trading was expensive and now it\u2019s free. That\u2019s obviously complete nonsense,\u201d he said.\n\nPart of the allure of retail platforms such as Robinhood is that they provide zero-commission trading. But Gerko said charges are hidden in the difference between the buy and sell price, the so-called spread, meaning brokers and market makers want clients to trade shares where this gap is widest, such as in illiquid stocks that are generally thinly traded.\n\n\u201cIf a market maker earns a certain spread from retail flow, and then pays some percentage of that spread to the retail broker\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009you end up with a perverse incentive to ensure that the end clients trade stocks with very wide spreads,\u201d he said.\n\nThe 41-year-old mathematician\u2019s criticism comes as shares in cinema chain AMC Entertainment and other meme stocks, popular with retail investors in online forums such as Reddit, are soaring once again. AMC shares have jumped by more than 500 per cent in the past month to last week\u2019s highs before moderating, gaining a further boost after the company promised retail investors additional perks \u2014 including free popcorn.\n\n\nGerko said brokerages and other intermediaries are among the beneficiaries of these share price pops, particularly as retail brokers often sell their clients\u2019 trades in bulk on to market makers, which then aim to secure favourable prices for clients. This practice, known as \u201cpayment for order flow\u201d (PFOF), earned US brokers $2.9bn in 2020 without charging amateur investors commission up front, and has attracted attention from regulators.\n\n\u201cIn the current ecosystem there is somehow enough\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. [to] leave market makers with billions of dollars of revenue,\u201d he said. \u201cSo where does this money come from? The retail investors. When people are claiming that they provided X billion dollars of price improvement last year, the question is whether any of that price improvement is real. And whether it\u2019s something they should be proud of.\u201d\n\nThe Russian-born UK citizen started his career as a currencies trader at Deutsche Bank. In 2015, he set up XTX Markets and built one of the largest computer-driven trading firms in the world. He has kept a low profile while amassing more wealth than some household names. Last year he contributed more to the UK\u2019s tax coffers than the Duke of Westminster, according to the Sunday Times, making him the 13th largest individual taxpayer in the country.\n\nHis firm does not employ human traders but relies purely on computer models to buy and sell assets in a bid to generate profits. It does not engage in payment for order flow. The firm is the third largest dealer in global currency markets and handles 13 per cent of European equities traded on exchanges. Since 2019, the company has also been in US stock markets.\n\nA recent paper from consultancy BestX Research said price improvement on retail market orders averages about 25 per cent, compared with the standard benchmark. But the paper added that this in reality was \u201cakin to getting a 30 per cent discount on an item after the shopkeeper raises the price by 40 per cent,\u201d because the benchmark covers only a small slice of the market.\n\nBroker Robinhood and the two of the largest US market makers, Citadel and Virtu, have defended the PFOF model, arguing there is no evidence that payment for order flow harms investors. But newly sworn-in chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Gary Gensler, has said he would make the PFOF model a focus of future work.\n\nGerko said one solution could be to strip PFOF out of the process, and instead to feed retail traders\u2019 orders on to exchanges where they would match off against each other or market makers would compete to execute the deals. He also bats away criticism that his proposals are self-serving, noting that XTX advocates for market structure changes in all markets, even where they play a dominant role already, such as currency markets.\n\nEven with those kinds of changes, however, he doubts that retail investors can emerge victorious from another round of battle with sophisticated trading firms. \u201cRetail investors have managed to cause some pain to one hedge fund. I can assure you in the long run it won\u2019t be retail participants winning this game, that\u2019s just impossible.\u201d\n\nSource: Retail frenzy reflects \u2018broken\u2019 US equity markets, says XTX\u2019s Gerko https:\/\/on.ft.com\/3cq2h3u \n\nFree to read",

On Tuesday 9th February, a user who claimed to make over 500,000 USD in earnings from the famous cannabis stocks Tilray and Aphrra boosted told the forum\u2019s 8.8 million members that they still had a lot more room to rise. \n\n\nHis post quickly started trending and today has around 13000 upvotes and 1200 comments.\n\n\nTilray has been in the news quite a lot lately. The Canada based, US listed company has been riding a wave of good news. It has made agreements to export its products to Europe, and is set to merge with Aphria to create the largest cannabis company. No wonder it has drawn attention from both hedge funds and private investors on r\/wallstreetbets.\n\n\nSince December 2020, when the merger announcement was first made, Tilray\u2019s share price has jumped around 400%, while Aphria has grown 243%. Other companies are also riding this wave: Canopy Growth\u2019s shares have doubled, and so has ETFMG Alternative Harvest, a fund tracking cannabis stocks all over the world.\n\n\nSince Wednesday 10th February, Reddit Day traders have started showing a lot of interest in cannabis stocks. Both Tilray and Aphria have seen sudden spikes in demand, and their share prices increased 21% and 10% respectively. However, just like Gamestop, this interest was short lived.\n\n\nOn the other hand, short interest in Cannabis stocks is also high. According to Reuters, approximately 37% of Tilray\u2019s free float (shares which are being actively traded in the market) is currently loaned out to hedge funds, up from 27.3% in January.\n\n\nHedge funds are also quite familiar with cannabis companies. For example, in 2018, Tilray\u2019s price skyrocketed from $20 to $300 in the three months following legalization, and forced short sellers to hastily cover their positions by buying stocks (which were also not quite readily available for purchase). \n\n\nNonetheless, according to Yahoo Finance, right now,  there is an approximately 51% short interest in Cannabis stocks by hedge funds and institutional investors. \n\n\nThe only question remains is this, will the Reddit Effect make Tilray and Aphria the new Gamestop?\n\n\nSource : You can read more detail in [this article](https:\/\/buymyweedonline.com\/marijuana\/how-the-reddit-effect-has-impacted-cannabis-stocks\/)",
        "813":"Degenerate Story Time (trials and tribulations of a retard) So since we\u2019re rolling into the weekend I figured this would be a good time to learn a little about the journey some of us have been on the past year or so. I\u2019m sure everyone has a unique personal story of their financial journey throughout this past year or so. I\u2019d love to hear some of the fucking disasters you bulls\/bears\/apes have gotten yourself into as well as the successes. I\u2019m sure mine is mildly entertaining compared to many but I\u2019ll start us off. \n\nOriginally started investing in 2019. I sold all of my positions before the Covid crash last spring (only trading stocks, was up over 100% on my portfolio in approx 6 months which I know is peanuts compared to the gains many have but I was proud of myself for just starting out and mostly swing trading boomer shit) which turned out to be an amazing decision except for the fact that I did not reinvest any of it during the massive March dip. Like many I was stuck in a whirlwind of uncertainty and did not know if society would ever return to normal. So I did the rational thing you would do with your gains. I spent it on drugs and alcohol, and paid off my car note so I could trade my Acura in for my dream car. I bought an Audi s8 which is a car I wanted since I was a teenager. It was fucking amazing, I couldn\u2019t believe it was mine (the banks) and I got to drive that shit around every day. I swear to god I will hit 100mph every single time I got behind the wheel of that car. Even if it was just to run a couple miles up the road to the gas station. My car note was insane, between the payment and my insurance I was paying as much to have that car as I was for my rent each month. It took up a big portion of my disposable income so I stayed away from investing until about August of 2020. I took what was left in my savings account after all those bad decisions and decided once again to jump back into the market. The September tech stock crash pretty much wiped me out and I cut my losses and walked away with a fraction of the money I started with. The next month I crashed the shit out of my Audi. She had no chance with me as the owner. This turned out to be a blessing in disguise because guess what boys, I can now take all the money I was putting into my car (which was waaaaaay out of my league by the way) and invest it. I came up with a monthly budget and by Nov 2020 I was back in the trading game. I spent literally hours each day researching and learning as much as I could. I figured out my swing trading style, had a solid game plan going into each trade, and was making bank. Bank for me anyways. All through Nov and Dec I was making more money swing trading stocks each day than I do at my full time job. I felt like Warren fucking Buffet. \n\n*GME enters stage left\n\nJanuary. Mothering fucking January. Over the course of the couple months prior I had built up a nice little chunk of change for myself and had a portfolio to be proud of. This is when I decided to yolo on GME. Did I buy at $10 or $20, or even $30? No, of course fucking not. I started buying that shit in the $70s and before you knew it I had a triple digit average and had unrealized daily profit that exceeded what I make in a month at work. Oh, BB and AMC are squeezing this month too? Sure I\u2019ll take some of those. Fast forward about a week and I\u2019m selling at a loss and have less money than I had started with in November. I could have secured profits but no. A week of investing in GME had erased all of my fundamentals and made me abhor the color green apparently. Here I am five months later and I\u2019ve barely clawed my way back to breaking even on the cash I initially invested. \n\nDid I swear off meme stocks after this cataclysmic failure of investing? You bet your ass I did. Did I try to swing trade GME again a couple weeks later with some fresh powder and lose even more money? You should know the answer to that at this point. Despite my constant tribulations did I once again buy AMC and BB this week? Of course I did you sexy animal. So here I stand before you today, a full on retard that barely learns from his mistakes. I\u2019d love to hear some of y\u2019all\u2019s investing stories from the past year.  \ud83d\ude18",

Much of my knowledge of the markets has been acquired through reading countless hours of DD posted by others.\n\nOBLIGATORY - BuY & HoDl!\n\nNow that that is out of the way, I would like to reference a few authors and their inspired DD that helped get me to this point.

Not sure if that is just because I have not really written any DD's before.\n\nPlease click the image to view it blown up and actually take in what is being laid out for you with my lovely computer crayons which I swear to god I don't eat...

Perhaps gamma squeeze is more appropriate given u\/yelyah2 recent DD?\n* Yellow is micro squeeze 1\n* Blue is micro squeeze 2\n* Pink is the past 6 days\n\nAlright folks.  I have talked a lot about other peoples work, and given you a graphic.  Now comes my value add.\n\nKey observations:\n\n* Not only was it a 10 trading day ramp up from the February 24th initiation to $350 on March 10th, but it was also **EXACTLY 10 TRADING DAYS** between the January 13th initiation to the $480 peak on January 29th.  My reason for calling this out specifically is that it strengthens the theory surrounding the combined T+35\/T+21 day price movements, and helps us further establish that we could potentially go **PARABOLIC AGAIN 10 trading days from 5\/25 on JUNE 9th.**  Will they be able to stop us this time?  Maybe it doesn't even matter if the do... See my next points\n* In the aftermath of the January \"micro squeeze\" the Dec-Jan price floor of \\~$20 **DOUBLED**, and the new price floor was set at \\~$40 between Feb 5th - 25th.     In the aftermath of the Feb 24th - Mar 10th \"micro squeeze\" the price floor of \\~$40 **TRIPLED**, and the new price floor was set at \\~$120 between Feb 5-25.  Given that the price floor doubled and then tripled after these two events, **could we be expecting the new price floor of more than 3X $120?** (That would be a price floor of $360+ for those of you who needed help there)\n* Edit to previous bullet: someone makes a fair point that \"We can\u2019t assume that since it doubled in January from $20 to $40 and tripled in March from $40 to $120 that therefore the next floor must be more than 3x $120. What if the rule in the sequence is +20->+80->+140? Or what if +20->+80->+20->+80?\"  I have included this just to explicitly state that my question **\"could we be expecting the new price floor of more than 3X $120?\"** by no means is intended to say the price floor WILL triple again.  I feel like this is a good point to say that this is speculation and theorization based on observation and nothing more.\n* The MACD line has literally only had significant crossovers (golden cross) 3 times this year.\n   * Event 1, Yellow ($480 run)\n   * Event 2, Blue ($350 run)\n   * Event 3, Pink (May 17th - today)\n\nAdditionally, I have plotted trend lines for each of the events.\n\n* Event 1 (Yellow) we saw a 10 day increase of roughly 1,733%\n* Event 2 (Blue) we saw a 10 day increase of roughly 770%.\n* 770 \/ 1733 = 44% or a 56% reduction in 10 day price increase, although the price was starting from a floor of $40 instead of $20.\n* 44% of 770% would be 338% starting from $120 which would mean a peak price of \\~$405 in event 3, **IF** this short pattern continues exactly the same.\n* THIS PATTERN WILL NOT CONTINUE EXACTLY THE SAME.\n* I am only observing the trend of the current pattern.  The sample size here is literally 2 events, albeit 2 very unlikely \"coincidental\" events.  And I don't believe in coincidence.\n* The pattern will break for many reasons, but the main reason is that hedge fund manipulation literally cannot continue forever.\n* Once they get margin called its off to the races, and hopefully this event is the straw that quite literally breaks the camels back (Kenny G, you are the camel)\n\nOh yeah... forgot about this one.  LOOK AT THE VOLUME.  ITS LITERALLY FUCKING INSANE.  MEDIA IS PUSHING AMC, KOSS, ANYTHING OTHER THAN GME AND YET IT HAS RUN UP FROM $132 (April 13th) TO $290 WITHOUT A SINGLE TRADING DAY VOLUME GREATER THAN 21 MILLION.  WE SAW VOLUMES OF MORE THAN 150 MILLION IN JANUARY!\n\nAlright guys.  To summarize.  We could be looking at going parabolic again on June 9th based on the pattern identified by the authors I mentioned above.  The price action and technical signals are bullish as fuck.\n\n**This is not my original post**",

It's a lot easier for hedge funds to stave off a massive squeeze, if everyone is putting their money into other stocks instead of concentrating on the one that got us all here. Maybe they're using other meme stocks as a hedge against GME. Like buying calls on stocks like AMC, and then promoting them as the next GME, then when everyone buys into AMC or whatever the new hot stock is, they then have more money to cover their shorts on GME.

This post is in continuation of a series of posts I made in the previous weeks. You can find last weeks post [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/nj7tco\/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and\/). The response I received was amazing and a lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. So here goes!   \n\n**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**\n\n[  ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ke62zgv6o9271.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=67333daccbb4aefc351eff62aad5e9d8b0f1d40b)\n\nOverall, it was a good week for meme stocks in the market. It took a 176% rally in AMC stock price in one week to finally dethrone GME and become the most discussed stock of the week.  GME is a close second and had an exceptional week in the market. Virgin Galactic also made into the top 10 list due to them successfully completing their spaceflight. Another newcomer to the list is BlackBerry. If a stock could run for President, it should probably be BlackBerry as the percentage of people who have a bullish outlook on the stock far outweighs any other stock which is reflected in the sentiment. Electric car makers are still continuing to generate interest following the launch of Ford\u2019s F150 lightning. \n\n**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**  \n\n[  ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/kpnkug68o9271.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=c88d4c286c7bf60e4e94cbf0ac3760cba0a90b35)\n\nAbove is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. We definitely have some interesting stocks in the list.\n\n**Virgin Galactic ($SPCE):** \n\n[  ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/6b1p1y39o9271.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f64d87ae205fce62b2be427ecd81638af12b868)\n\nNo points for guessing the top growing stock of the week. Virgin Galactic exploded in mentions due to its SpaceShipTwo craft (pictured above) reaching space. This marked the company\u2019s first flight in more than two years and they expect to launch paying customers as soon as 2022. Wall Street analysts have flip-flopped on their rating first downgrading the stock price by 33% and then upgrading it back to their earlier recommendation (a 50% hike). Overall, the company has already reached the consensus 12-month price target of $31.20 and has risen a cool 25% in the last week.\n\n**Beyond Meat($BYND):** The stock has rallied 28% last week mainly following commentary from CNBC's Jim Cramer. On his Mad Money show, Cramer said the WallStreetBets crowd should make Beyond Meat the next meme stock to drive a short squeeze. He specifically noted that almost 25% of $BYND shares are held short, setting up a scenario for sharp gains. Since Wednesday, there has been a continuous stream of $BYND YOLO\u2019s and DDs across Reddit sparking the rise in the discussion.\n\n**BlackBerry($BB):** shares jumped as much as 12% Wednesday amid cheers from Redditors and a broader rally in meme stocks. One important thing to note here is BlackBerry's short interest still remains below 10% of shares outstanding, meaning any short squeeze wouldn't have too much room to run. [This](https:\/\/investorplace.com\/2021\/05\/blackberry-by-any-other-name-would-have-a-much-higher-valuation\/) article has an interesting theory where they argue that BlackBerry by any other name would have a much higher valuation.\n\n**NVIDIA($NVDA):** announced a stellar quarter with revenue of $5.66 billion, up 84 percent from a year earlier, and Data Center revenue of $2.05 billion, up 79 percent from a year earlier. They are projecting a record $6.3B revenue next quarter. The stock experienced a delayed earnings reaction and has gained 8.4% this week. Considering how hard it was to buy the new NVIDIA product, I don\u2019t expect their revenue growth to plateau anytime soon.\n\n**Sundial Growers($SNDL):** was trending as the stock passed the $1-mark last Friday. For those who are not familiar with the company, it was ridden up from 60 cents to almost $3 within one month last February. With the current rally in stock price and with the price getting over the psychological barrier of $1, interest seems to be picking up.\n\nSOME FAQ\u2019s:\n\n**How does the program work:** The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).\n\n**What is sentiment:** It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also (eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here is the average across all the comments.\n\nThank you for reading!\n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor.*",

        "827":"Amazon should consider buying Gamestop due to natural synergies between the two business models. Here's my full case. **1: Amazon wants to open up physical stores to sell over-stocked computer equipment from their warehouses. Gamestop has suitable locations for them all across the country to do so.**\n\nAmazon has been looking into this idea even before the pandemic, and delayed its plans because of the pandemic. Essentially, Amazon has a bunch of excess stock of computer equipment in its warehouses that they really just want to get rid of (since it costs money to store). Instead of throwing it out they would prefer to sell it - even at a big discount. This is likely stuff like older graphics cards, monitors, computers etc. This solves a key issue with Gamestop's business model: Gamestop's margin's suck. Selling computer equipment that would have just been thrown out anyway means that every dollar sold is a dollar saved.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's the original news report for anyone who wants more information:\n\n[https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2021-04-01\/amazon-explored-opening-home-goods-electronics-discount-store](https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2021-04-01\/amazon-explored-opening-home-goods-electronics-discount-store)\n\nAnd if you're paywalled out here's a couple others that should do the trick:\n\n[https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/amazon-discussed-discount-electronics-home-goods-stores-report-2021-4](https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/amazon-discussed-discount-electronics-home-goods-stores-report-2021-4)\n\n[https:\/\/www.bnnbloomberg.ca\/amazon-explored-opening-home-goods-electronics-discount-store-1.1585362](https:\/\/www.bnnbloomberg.ca\/amazon-explored-opening-home-goods-electronics-discount-store-1.1585362)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2: A number of ex-Amazon executives already work at Gamestop in the C-Suite**\n\nDue to this - the cultures of the companies are likely to become very similar and people at Amazon and Gamestop are likely to have worked together in the past. This makes any type of business combination much easier\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's a couple (I'm sure you guys can add more to this list): \n\nChief Growth Officer (CGO):  Elliott Wilke \n\nChief Operating Officer (COO):  Jenna Owens\n\nChief Technology Officer (CTO):  Matt Francis\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/gamestop-announces-third-hire-from-amazon-for-executive-team-2021-3](https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/gamestop-announces-third-hire-from-amazon-for-executive-team-2021-3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3: A clean exit from a short selling debacle**\n\nMany people have floated around theories of naked short selling, imaginary shares, etc. No matter if you believe these are correct or not lets make an assumption here that there is something fishy going on. If there is something fishy going on, there's nothing the SEC would like more than to neatly sweep it under the rug. Lets say this fishy thing makes it so that closing all short positions in GameStop would cause the stock price to skyrocket due to a share shortage and pose a serious threat to the entire financial system. Obviously this isn't a great outcome if the financial system fails\n\nHow does Amazon solve this? An all-stock deal. Short sellers go from being short Gamestop to being short Amazon. The number of liquid shares of Amazon is far greater in dollar value than the liquid shares of Gamestop. This means that short sellers would be able to close out of their position without pushing up Amazon's stock price to some ridiculous number\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**4: Amazon has the cash to bankroll and supercharge Gamestop's innovation**\n\nBetween developing NFTs and reinventing their business Gamestop has some challenges ahead of it. To execute on their strategies they will need cash to do so. An Amazon + Gamestop merger is more valuable than Gamestop alone and Amazon alone. Furthermore Amazon could benefit from this Gamestop's NFT technology (think digital rights management solution for all of Amazon's content) and expand its market share in collectables and gaming.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**5: Amazon could use a distraction from news focusing on thwarted worker unionization attempts**\n\nBeing able to shift the news narrative from \"Amazon kills unionization attempts\" to \"Amazon saves \\~50,000 jobs at struggling retailer Gamestop\" seems like an obvious perk of doing this deal\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust a couple recent articles about Amazon:\n\nFrontpage news was made fairly recently as Amazon defeated a unionization attempt\n\n[https:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/economy\/2021\/5\/19\/amazon-plans-for-new-alabama-warehouse-after-us-union-defeat](https:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/economy\/2021\/5\/19\/amazon-plans-for-new-alabama-warehouse-after-us-union-defeat)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA NYT article titled \"How Amazon Crushes Unions\"\n\n[https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2021\/03\/16\/technology\/amazon-unions-virginia.html](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2021\/03\/16\/technology\/amazon-unions-virginia.html)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**6: Jeff Bezos is looking for a new project. Being the biggest champion of GameStop would cement his legacy**\n\nNow that Jeff Bezos is stepping down as CEO of Amazon, he has time to work on new projects. Gamestop sounds like a fun fixer-upper for a billionaire with some extra time on his hands. Furthermore the rivalry between Elon Musk and Bezos has never been greater; their competing space projects (blue origin and spacex) have gone head to head in recent years. Elon has a key advantage that Bezos doesn't though - a die-hard fanbase. Arguably these fans have really powered SpaceX and Tesla's success - as Elon's celebrity status draws in talent and sells product. Bezos, while popular doesn't quite have the same type of energized fans. Buying Gamestop would also buy him an army of WSB apes and close the gap.\n\nElon & Jeff have been rivals for years:\n\n[https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/jeff-bezos-elon-musk-rivalry-history-timeline-2020-7](https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/jeff-bezos-elon-musk-rivalry-history-timeline-2020-7)\n\nPlus, now that he is single he has time to play videogames!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**7: Bootstrapping Amazon's P\/E Ratio**\n\nBuying GameStop would make Amazon look cheaper (in terms of P\/E ratio). As of 5\/28 yahoo finance is showing forward (next 12 months) PE ratios of 54 for Amazon and 37 for Gamestop (price around 220) as of 5\/28\n\nHaving a P\/E ratio of 54 and buying a company with a PE ratio of 37 makes the combined company have a P\/E ratio somewhere between the two. Amazon P\/E ratio going from 54 to less than 54 makes the stock look like a better deal to investors.",

After both breakouts, they traded above the bollinger bands for 3 back to back sessions\n3. After GME's breakout, we saw a consolidation of price action for 5 trading sessions\n4. After AMC's breakout we saw a consolidation of price action for 7 trading sessions\n5. From GME's low on it's initial breakout to it's high the Friday before the squeeze, we saw on increase of 283%\n6. From AMC's low on it's initial breakout to it's high the Friday before the potential squeeze, we saw an increase of 245%\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is where things get interesting...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe bullish candle that was formed for GME on Friday, January 22nd looks ALOT like the bullish candle formed on Thursday, May 27th for AMC\n\nThe spinning top candle that was formed for GME on Monday, Jan 25th looks alot like the spinning top candle formed on Friday, May 28th for AMC\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTaking into consideration the market is closed on memorial day, is this history repeating itself?

        "830":"Cramer said\u2026. CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer said Wednesday he\u2019s not sure why any investors are still betting against GameStop and AMC Entertainment, two of the so-called meme stocks popular on Reddit\u2019s WallStreetBets forum.\n.\n.\nThe \u201cMad Money\u201d host made his comments following a session in which GameStop shares rose almost 16% Wednesday and AMC advanced 19%. The stocks are up 37% and more than 60%, respectively, this week alone as the speculative trading that took first Wall Street by storm in January resumed.\n.\n.\n\u201cAnyone shorting AMC or GameStop is out of their mind. ... WallStreetBets is too powerful and trying to bet against them right now is just giving them more ammo,\u201d Cramer said.\n.\n.\nDespite some optimism around a potential turnaround spearheaded by Chewy co-founder Ryan Cohen, Cramer contended the video-game retailer GameStop remains way overvalued. AMC \u2014 which still faces headwinds from the rise of digital streaming \u2014 is also expensive at current levels, Cramer said.\n.\n.\nBut Cramer the companies are not trading based on fundamentals, which makes shorting their stocks dangerous as long as they remain beloved by Reddit traders.\n.\n.\nShorting a stock is essentially a bet that it will fall in price. An investor such as a hedge fund borrows shares and then immediately sells them into the market, with the goal of buying them back later at a lower level. Then, the investor returns the borrowed shares, profiting off the price differential.\n.\n.\nWhen the opposite happens and the stock rises in value, a short-seller may seek to minimize losses by purchasing shares at their higher price.\n.\n.\nBoth GameStop and AMC have over 20% of their float shares sold short, according to data from S3 Partners. That\u2019s compared with an average of 5% short interest in a typical U.S. stock.\n.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this: a group of buyers with no sensitivity to price,\u201d Cramer said. \u201cThese people don\u2019t have unlimited firepower, but they\u2019ve got enough firepower to engineer a short-squeeze any time a bunch of professionals decide to bet against this thing.\u201d\n.\n.\n\u201cThese people don\u2019t have unlimited firepower\u2026\u201d\n.\n.\nI believe Cramer has never met the INTERNET!!!!!!",
        "831":"Daym it feels good to be a GME hodler in times like these! Take a look at this sweet TA picture: Bollinger Bands are boilin', MACD(onalds) pointing north... And the Purple Haze is being tested! How do you like this, Wen Moon?  \n\n[GME Daily Chart](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/7f0br59p2i171.jpg?width=2379&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8235e35a004aee7fa7f74e591251a636aa2421ce)\n\nSup, WSB folks!\n\nIt\u2019s Roman here with my Technical ANALysis, remember me? I\u2019m the guy who [put the beard on the line, stating that GME is heading at least to thousands](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/nc6qi3\/lets_revive_the_buried_wsb_culture_gme_to\/), soon, and my beard is doing well so far, as you may see. Furthermore, recently I did [AMC TA](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/nfaizr\/amc_looking_juicy_next_resistance_targets_1623\/), and it got to [CBS fucking news](https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/amp\/news\/amc-gamestop-meme-stock-rally-continues\/)! Btw, the first major resistance there of $16 has been broken already, $20 is the next one and the things are going according to the forecast.\n\nCongrats to AMC hodlers, but today we\u2019ll take a look at the superior stonk\u2018s current TA state, discussing how things might play out in the shorter term perspective.\n\nThe first thing to take a look at this [GME](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/eAxaHhE) chart, is the beautiful Bollinger Bands setup. Bollinger Bands is a powerful TA instrument, used by traders for the purpose of identifying potential support and resistance zones, as well as a trend direction. Furthermore, BB is a helpful tool to work with the volatility, as price action\u2018s fluctuations are taken as a cornerstone measurement for the Bollinger channels. As you should be able to see on the chart, with the volatility in Jan, Feb and Mar the BB channel looks thick (just as your BF\u2019s GF\u2019s ass). Since the beginning of April, though, the consolidation is obvious, and the channel consequently has been narrowing down. But BOOM, the breakout happened yesterday followed by the conformational solidly looking gap today. The setup of a very similar nature crystallized in January too (highlighted blue) and it is easy to see what happened afterwards. Juicy, what else can I say.\n\nMACD. The thing points up, indicating the bullish momentum, with all of the threes indicators (MACD, Signal and Histogram) being on the bullish territory and accelerating with the current price action.\n\nAnd the most important factor to \ud83d\udc3b in mind, resistances. As I mentioned in the title, the Purple Haze ($233) is being tested currently, and to my understanding, this is the most important price level for GME currently (refer to this [post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/nc6qi3\/lets_revive_the_buried_wsb_culture_gme_to\/) for the explanation). As soon as this one is conquered, $350 and $481 seem to be the next two major resistances on the horizon.\n\nI hope, that you enjoyed this little piece of TA, have a great day! \n\n(and compulsory not a fin advise and fuck you!)",

I am so confident in it, that I dared to put my beard (which I have for five years already) on the line! Worth your full read, I promise! I decided to structure the analysis in the following way: first we'll take a look at the VW short squeeze, revisiting its origins and background as the very first step of the discussion - in order to better understand the fundamental context of TA; after that I'll lay down the main technical parameters and frameworks, through which the [GMESS](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/Sd4uE1b) thesis will be dissected, applying all of those to VWSS and explaining the TA core on the Volkswagen example; then, the process will be repeated, but this time TSLASS anatomy will be elaborated upon. Finally, all of the data accumulated in the process, as well as the major findings made, will be applied to the current technical state of GME, in order to construct at least a potential forecast and the probable price action. Buckle up and eat a crayon, let's start.\n\nOh, and one more thing! I really encourage you to dive deep into the ANALysis with me, because the thesis can only be understood if all of the technical factors at play are considered in the sharpest detail first - and then in the aggregate: zooming out and looking at the bigger picture through the prism of coincidences, interdependences and probabilities. Dafaq did I just write? - Dunno, but that's exactly what I meant!\n\n(Not a financial advice, as I am not a professional advisor, just an amateur ANALyzer)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Volkswagen - Das Short-Squeeze: Sep 2007 - Mar 2009\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRemember, when VW became the most valued company in the world for a brief wild period of trading? I bet, Pepperidge apes remember. The squeeze played out right in the midst of the global financial crisis, and such an occurrence was fueled by a curious background scenario, orchestrated largely by one very interesting person. Back then, the former President of Porsche, Wendelin Wiedeking (must be a cousin of Battlefield Counterstrike), was pursuing a goal of taking over Volkswagen. In this process, he used cash-settled options to circumvent the transparency and disclosure of Porsche\u2019s market operations. While being acquired by Porsche, Volkswagen had its ordinary shares premium risen to disproportionately high levels compared to its preference shares.\n\nAs the general public was finding out about Wendysking\u2019s takeover plan, hedge funds and particularly short-sellers set their eyes on the fact that Volkswagen\u2019s preferred shares were traded at a significant discount to the ordinaries (approximately 70%). While the price of the ordinary stock gradually increased, the preferential shares stayed put - and the hedge funds smelt an arbitrage opportunity. They started shorting the stock and buying the preferred shares to profit on the massive divergence. For a moment, there was no news of Porsche continuing its purchase of VW ordinaries from the market, and that fact gave the hedge funds additional confidence. Only to get blindsided, as it turned out later. One shorts-frying weekend, Porsche announced its total holding in VW, cornering the substantial part of the float, and leaving only 6% in free float. In the meantime, short sales had risen to 12% of total stock outstanding. When the market found out that Porsche had acquired 74.1% of the outstanding shares through the in-transparent cash-settled options, VWSS happened - briefly making Volkswagen the largest company in the world, and finally allowing the shorting side to [GUH](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/dpnzup\/i_recorded_todays_marketopen_and_the_instant\/):\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>It was mathematically impossible for every short-seller to buy a share, and therefore close their position. In other words, half the room were going to be left in a burning building with no way out. A panicked dash for the exit began.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2014 A spot on metaphor by Jamie Powell, an FT journalist. Hedge funds are estimated to have lost $20 to $30 billion by betting against VW ordinary stock.\n\nWhat is really ironic (in Palpatine voice) - even though Porsche managed to burn many short sellers, the company couldn\u2019t pay up for the huge positions it had created, and ended up being acquired by VW instead.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/3w0ajhk1f2z61.jpg?width=1722&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a4d29a8a0c5ccacfdd193f3e2d5100d0cfdee74b\n\nAlso, interestingly enough, after his departure from Porsche, Wiedeking was charged with market manipulation for his role in the takeover bid. The charges were dropped in July 2016 due to a too little chance of success. Lucking Fegend.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Now let\u2019s take a look at how this epic event was incorporated into the chart:**\n\n[VWSS, Daily Chart](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/d3pfzvb202z61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e497ddf6518faec188269120c44df64ab6cb1791)\n\nEven though it all looks overwhelming from the first glance, don't worry, I'll explain. There are only two major TA instruments used here, namely Fibonacci retracement \ud83c\udf08tool (useful for assessing 'altitude' and the crucial support\/resistance levels, check out the in-depth explanation of this TA tool [in my other post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/mwevzz\/the_big_short_20_why_bears_may_soon_reconsider\/)). The second one is the trend based Fibonacci extension for time periods (pink vertical grid with numbers 0, 0.382, 0.618 and so on) - for setting the major time landmarks and zones. Furthermore, you should have noticed the three catchy geometric figures, and the purple line - which is actually a good starting point to unfold the technical thesis.\n\nIn the process of working with VW, TSLA and GME charts, I managed to identify several peculiar characteristics and patterns, that were of an evident nature and have been manifested on all of the three charts, to one degree or another. The most prominent one, in my opinion, is the killer purple resistance\/support level. For the current VW example, it is somewhere around $30 mark, or $29.27 if you like precision.\n\nOne may observe on the chart above, that this level is indeed the most significant level through the complete history of VWSS. First, the preliminary to the squeeze major bull run, which solidly accelerated in the middle of September 2007, was held back and repulsed by this level's resistance on the last day of October. It took almost half a year for the price action to catch up to it again in late March 2008. This was followed by a consolidation (with several failed attempts of breakout) just below this level, which lasted for more than 100 days, before the price action finally torn the resistance apart with the powerful gap on the 16th of July '08. And guess what? Even after that, the level played the major supportive role for the price action, with one final retest before the squeeze finally lift off it in the middle of September 2008. You should also make a note of how the price was still magnetized by this level during the final stages of the squeeze. The signifficance of this price level for the whole chart of VW above is difficult to underestimate. Seeing the importance of this level and being a fan of Jimi Hendrix, I decided to name it \"**Purple Haze**\".\n\nLet's inspect the fancy geometric shapes now. These are actually much more reasoned and circumspective than it may seem from the first glance. The first one, in orange, is a cup shaped consolidation (let it be called the \"**Squeezy Grail**\", because why not?) - taking place above 100% Fibo and just below the 'Purple Haze'  - which commenced as soon as this major resistance level had been tested for the first time. It is subsequently followed by the second consolidation of a flatter nature \\[if you know what else is of a flatter nature, comment and if the joke is good enough I may give you an award\\], which again plays around the main $30 level on the chart. The second consolidation, highlighted by the pink rectangle (a.k.a. the \"**Runway**\"), is actually more important than the first one, because here is the point where the paramount breakout happens: the 'Purple Haze' resistance is blew off (in the middle of 0.382 period). Based on that observation, it is also appropriate to assume that in order for the squeeze to initiate, the 'Purple Haze' has to be conquered at some point inside 0.382 Fibo time zone, during the 'Runway' stage. Finally, the triangular \"**Squieezluminati Confirmed**\" part is self explanatory, imho. Oh, just one commentary worth being made here: take a look at how the squeeze itself is proportionate, bipartite, and fits well into the isosceles triangle. The nature surely knows how to play with stonks, too.\n\nEspecially, when we talk about Fibonacci. The horizontal \ud83c\udf08 grid, Fibo retracement, is often used to estimate the possible corrective trend's depth, as well as to identify the key support and resistance levels of it. This one is comfortably applied to the beninging and the apex point of the trend (see the gray dash and dash line on the chart above), and its relevance is subsequently confirmed by how the price action plays around the levels in the triangle. The 12th of September '07 seems to be a good starting point for Fibo retracement application, because on that day another important resistance of $20.72 was penetrated for the first time (then confirmed as support with the beautiful bear trap candle on 23 Jan '08). Furthermore, $20.72 level works like an ideal 100% Fibo retrace level for the current example, and supports the 'Holy Grail' comparable to how my granny supports me. Also, take a note of the 'Purple Haze' being relatively in the middle, in between 78.6% and 100% of Fibo retracement - an important factor that will enable us to apply this retracement to GME later.\n\nNot only the 12th of September fits well as Fibo retracement starting point, it is also a perfect spot to start stretching out the trend-based Fib time grid (TBFTG - to be fucked then go, alternatively). This one is a complex instrument, so take this quick explanation for granted or do your own research in relation to it. Just like Fibo retracement, TBFTG is based on Fibonacci sequence, but this one applies to time periods, instead of the price action and levels. In order to use this instrument properly, it is necessary to identify the preliminary major trend, that will serve as the core measurement for the sequent time periods. Oh, it took me a lot of time to inspect that parameter and to identify those initial pink dash and dash trends, trust me! Tbh, it was one of the most difficult tasks to accomplish in the preparation of this TA. But the result was worth the effort! I noticed the following correlation applicable to both VWSS and TSLASS (and hypothetically to GME too): TBFTG pink dash measurement must involve the major preliminary impulse of the prior main trend, plus 'Squeezy Grail' phase. The staring point of TBFTG is particularly tricky to be identified, and I'm talking about all of the examples, but possible - especially when looking at the TA as a whole, referring to how the grid applies to the price action, and comparing the examples between each other. That is pure rocket science, if you ask me. And most importantly, the TBFTG measurement duration (pink dash and dash trend) seem to be very similar in length to 'Squieezluminati' basis - check the bars measurements on all of the charts (blue lines for VW).\n\nPay attention to the following features, which really help to dissect the squeezes' anatomies and to build the suitable technical framework: *the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurs in 0.382 TBFTG zone; and the squeeze lifts off in the first half of 0.618 zone, peaking at 1*; *TBFTG pink dash measurement includes major preliminary trend plus 'Squeezy Grail', as it has been mentioned above. Furthermore, the correlation in duration of TBFTG measurement and the triangle basis must once again be emphasized.*\n\nNoice, but let's move further.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Tesla, or how Elon Mask truly \u201cis become meme, Destroyer of shorts\u201d: Apr 2019 - Apr 2020\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTesla and the founder Elon Musk have confronted the short sellers on a regular basis, and even after the run-ins with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), for now, the former have been winning. The TSLA shorters were sitting on mark-to-market losses of over $40 billion in late 2020, as the company\u2019s shares exploded 740% last year. This information is based on data collected by Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, a fin-anal company.\n\nRemember the not so distant in past Tesla 'mania'? The prospects of Tesla\u2019s business and the furious opposition of bulls and bears, including famous fund managers like David Einhorn and Mark Spiegel (who still hold a strong opinion that TSLA is a house of cards ready to collapse), have over the years contributed to an extreme volatility in the stock price. Elon Musk openly criticized the short-sellers and their motivation to dig out and spread negative sentiment about the company. The 'taking Tesla private' play seemed to work out for the short-sellers as the stock price collapsed by about 50% from November 2018 to May 2019. After that, amidst Tesla\u2019s opening of the Shanghai Gigafactory and the announcement of the company's first annual operating profit exceeding analyst expectations, the tables have turned and the bear-beaten TSLA shares skyrocketed in price (not without noble WSBetters help, definitely). Needless to say, that previously steady short-sellers started getting anxious and scrambled to cover their positions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDusaniwsky told Institutional Investor (B2B media) that shorting Tesla is:\n\n>The longest unprofitable short I\u2019ve ever seen!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell, Mr. Dusaniwsky, WSB seem to have an answer for everything:\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/h3l5hayu02z61.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ecc69df97a282c4a22663e8487cf316488ed9d32\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile companies and founders often hold a scorn on short sellers, because they can bring down stock prices and cause the cost of capital to rise (or even do worse things, if you know what I mean), Musk\u2019s disdain for the short selling community is unrivaled. In the middle of 2020, Musk took a dig at short sellers by releasing 'short shorts'. These now sell at a premium on Ebay. It's all nice and good, but I have another cool merch idea - '**shortz r fuk**':\n\n[TSLASS, Daily Chart](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/f0qbrpqn22z61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=479c78e6763043f81e9ac2c75cf8a6c769d9eee4)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBeautiful, isn't it? Let's quickly run through the short squeeze anatomy checklist, thoroughly elaborated in the previous TA chapter via the example of VW. First things first, the 'Squeezy Grail' is present, but it resembles more of a V shape structure. Next, the 'Runway' stage is good-looking: a fucking massive gap happened there, and this time 78.6% Fibo level is tested during the 'Runway', being indicative of the TSLA bulls' crazy power. 'Squieezluminati Confirmed' is also really interesting here, as this time there is no isosceles triangle at its core structure, but rather a 'chainsaw'-like volatile price action taking place. Furthermore, you may see that inside of the triangle, there is the after-peak 78.6% Fibo zone retest, which in turn hedl and bounced the price back in the direction of... Moon. Blessed be the bulls!\n\nLooking at the 'Purple Haze' (which is again in between Fibo 78.6% and 100% \\[important!\\]), for TSLASS the major price level manifested at $52.46. During the first half of 2019, this level played a role of a magnetizing support, with the subsequent testing in March and the breakout to the downside in late April. Again, a lengthy, half a year long consolidation is taking place just below this level, and above Fibo 100% retracement. The breakout occurs, you guessed, right in the TBFTG 0.382 zone. And what is really fascinating, is the fact that, after the breakout, the 'Purple Haze' has never been retested. But who knows what the future holds?\n\nAnd the Fibos. The retracement, again, apples perfectly onto the complete squeeze structure: 78.6% is trialed several times; all of the upper levels except for 38.2% were broken with the subsequent retrace and and some with the retest. A particularly intensive price action was occurring for about two weeks near the 23.6% Fibo level, and the high of $189.4 level was penetrated and then touched gently during the initial squeeze. Ah, almost forgot, 100% ($35.75) Fibo level firmly holds the 'Squeezy Grail' in hand again.\n\nCurrent TBFTG should be of an interest for fellow TAnaLyzators too. Particularly, the downtrend, as opposed to VW uptrend, serves as the core for TBFTG's application (again, refer to the dash and dash pinkish line). This core is composed of the pre-'Squeezy Grail' downtrend plus the Grail itself. Take a look at gray measurements, which cover this phase and the triangle duration - again these two follow the tendency of being proportionate in the length as phases. *Crucially, the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurs in 0.382 TBFTG zone again; then one more time the squeeze lifts off in the first half of 0.618 zone, with the false first peak during the final stages of 0.618 and the proper peak at 1*.\n\nToo many coincidences and congruences between the two TA examples discussed above, if you ask me. Especially if the fact that such events happen once in ten years or so is taken into account. Two quotes are of a relevance here:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Coincidences mean you're on the right path - *Simon van Booy*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>If you gaze long enough into an asshole, the asshole will gaze back into you - u\/roman_axt\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome additional food for thought from TSLA:\n\n[For redditors with a different floor](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/gnd0yienc2z61.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b8b72e1671ad69cf871cde154ae386e52835e94a)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Game stopped, or it is just a beginning?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am absolutely confident that you all know even more than myself about the fundamental factors at play for GME, so I will not bother you here with the background explanation. There is a plenty of good HQ DD all around reddit, so let's jump straight to the sweet sweet TA:\n\n[GMESS, Daily Chart](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ko1ppnasc2z61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1d3f7c2a78135696d66a0a70e8e2a34ad4a04dbf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt this point, I feel that a disclaimer is necessary. Let me briefly remind you that this analysis is a thesis, or a hypothesis that has to be proven in the future. I do believe that there is a solid probability for things to play out this way, and my beard supports my manly confidence. However, this is the market, and it all may go another way at any point in time, that's the nature of things! Think critically, learn and do your own DD and TA. In a good memory of u\/ControlTheNarrative, at least.\n\nAnd so, it begins. Despite it may seem that there are too many unknown or at least questionable variables for now in this GMESS TA, I believe that I was able to identify the most crucial parameters to build the core of this technical analysis's thesis, since VWSS and TSLASS provided many clues and identifiable characteristics to refer to. The first and most important one is surely the 'Purple Haze'. I should remind you, that this mystically sounding level persistently held back the price for both of the squeeze examples discussed, and only upon the breakout of this level the short squeezes were initiated. For GME this major price level seems to be at about $233 mark, with two intensive tests in Jan and Mar, which proved it to be the most significant resistance on the chart above.\n\nThen, the shapes. The 'Squeezy Grail' (again occurring in between 78.6% and 100%) consolidation is also easily identifiable here, and it is yet again followed by the rectangular 'Runway' consolidation, where the price action currently stands. Remember, how historically (in TSLA and VW) the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurred somewhere near the spot of the current GME price action, in 0.382 Fibo time zone? Well, to paraphrase Ian Fleming: once is (VW) happenstance. Twice is (TSLA) coincidence. Three times is GMenemy action.\n\nFibos. Applying these two instruments to GME was real pain in the ass. Firstly, because the retracement is not usually used as a predictive instrument, being ordinarily applied to the completed trend. But since the situation is not ordinary at all, I played smarter (or more autistic, if you like). Due to the fact that the 'Purple Haze' level was approximately in between 78.6% and 100% Fibo in both of the previous examples, I assumed exactly that to be applicable here too. My belief is firmly backed up by this soft touch of 78.6% by the price action on Jan 28th. And when these two major levels were identified, the Fibo retracement horizontal grid just stretched out on GME itself.\n\nIdentifying the starting points for the trend for both Fibos was the most tricky part. After countless attempts and failures I found what I believe to be the cornerstone to the squeeze:\n\n[Fibos' initiation point zoomed in](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/t2ouren1d2z61.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1cd87d96bb42ac20451c86059295f7560c8c44e8)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy? Because this                        \u261d\ufe0f is clearly where the fun started.\n\nAnd now it all matches perfectly. So, I am patiently waiting for the 'Purple Haze' to be broken.

The SEC is \"gonna vigorously lean in against individuals... ...to assess\". # US House Financial Services Committee hearing on GameStop\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is a transcript of the question from Rep. David Scott (GA-13):\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>***Rep. David Scott (GA-13):***  \n>  \n>The question before us today is this: How can we on the Financial Services Committee ensure that our investors can both have access to our markets, but also are able to participate in our markets investing safely? You see when erroneous and inaccurate information posted on social media sites has the ability to broadly influence investors and move the market sometimes drastically. This, gentleman, poses a serious question for you, our regulators. *There is now such a huge hole in our regulatory process because of GameStop with inexperienced investors relying on unverified information from unqualified social media.*  \n>  \n>Mr. Cook, let me start with you: *\\[1\\] How can we effectively regulate the impact of new technology social media sites as they pertain to inexperienced investors? \\[2\\] And also, how do we treat that investment advice that we're getting from unqualified people on social media? \\[3\\] And then the real question, who is held accountable when that investment advice leads to market volatility like we've seen and massive losses for our investors?* I'd like for the three of you: Chair Gensler, Mr. Cook, Mr. Bodson... Answer this important question in the three parts that I outlined it for. This is what the American people need answers to from you regulators. Mr. Cook, why don\u2019t you start.  \n>  \n>***Mr. Robert Cook, President and CEO of FINRA:***  \n>  \n>Well, thank you thank you congressman for that question. I think you raised some really profound questions about where technology and other aspects of investor behavior may be going and how does that fit within the current regulatory regime. When we talk about statements by people on social media and other places, just to be clear, FINRA doesn't regulate that environment and we would look to the SEC in, sort of, understanding whether existing authorities around concepts like manipulation or providing investment advice might apply.  \n>  \n>*I do think that what we have also seen, though, and your point about retail investors making decisions without an intermediary or financial advisor is an important one. As we see more of that happen we are seeing a lot of that happen. I think we need to ask whether the existing regime is adequate in that regard.*  \n>  \n>***Rep. David Scott (GA-13):***  \n>  \n>Let me quickly get to Chair Gensler. I\u2019ve worked with him when he was chair of the CFTC. Chair, how do we hold somebody accountable? Answer this for me, as Mr. Cook just said, the SEC he said is the one responsible. How do we hold somebody... Well, what do we do about this, Chair Gensler?  \n>  \n>***Chair Gensler of the SEC:***  \n>  \n>I think you raise a good point. I know like, probably like me, it's not about somebody's free speech rights on social media but if somebody is trying to manipulate a market to defraud the market through social media and in our rapidly changing technology, it could be computers and not even humans, by the way, it could be computers communicating in. *So the SEC is a cop on the beat.

        "846":"The Technicals Behind GameStop #5 Hello everyone,  \nthe price of the GameStop stock (GMEUSD) finally broke out of a sideways movement and is currently looking for new highs ($185.00 at this moment) in the pre-market. We are looking forward to the US market opening in \\~4 hours. In order to be prepared for the undergoing trend-change, we are going to have a quick look on the chart.  \n\n\n[https:\\\/\\\/www.tradingview.com\\\/x\\\/Bbhn1dBH\\\/](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/1i18187enov61.png?width=2020&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b0b6345d359ec3fdb37790c3ea59a4b03438956)\n\nThe full chart is visible [here](https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/x\/Bbhn1dBH\/). We can see that the price was accumulating in a symmetrical triangle from March to this date. As soon as the price is hitting the demand zone (red channel), we see a strong reaction from the buyers on the market. While the sellers are preventing the buyers from making higher highs, we can also observe that the buyers support the price with higher lows - which results in the symmetrical shape.  \nThis is a simplification of how the buyers & sellers are acting on the market, and they are finally the ones who decide where the price is going next. The decreasing volume confirms this behavior. This breakout will drag more interest into the market, and we will see more price action (more volume).  \n\n\nNow we're looking at a change of structure\/ sentiment. The buyers were basically stronger than the sellers, and they managed to push the price above the previous high at $165.00, which is the first sign of an upwards trend. When we're looking at an upwards trend, we want to price to make higher highs and higher lows, supported by increasing volume. We want the market participants to confirm the breakout with trading action.  \n\n\nBuyers & Sellers usually look for previous price peaks to either leave the market or to enter the market. So we can expect small retracements at the previous highs (horizontal lines), followed by further price movements towards the next high.  \nThis upwards trend is currently supported by the MA200 (grey line), which is a great entry for those wo might want to join the party.  \n\n\nHave fun trading apes!",

        "849":"$GME Technical Analysis: Waves go Brrr Hi Fam, its me, Fam. \n\nThere is something going on with GME and it may be  **imminent**\nThis is my interpretation of GME thru wave counting\/elliotwave. \n\nRefer to this image first : https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/CR0OiQJ.jpg\n\nFrom a yearly point of view, we have accomplished wave 1(A) and wave 2(B) colored blue for those colored blind (idk how that works). We are in the mist of forming wave C.  That will be interpreted in the following paragraph. From this standpoint, we have strong support level at 23.6 fib level (priced 142.79). It was actually broken, but that level was a *test* to see how far it will go down. It found support again (twice) on several different locations (weeks later) This is very important because the psychology of the market (investors) show a threshold and now pointing towards a bullish movement - even though we were consolidating. Now, per elliot wave analysis, Wave 3 is the **BIGGEST** wave of the 5 wave formation. It  must past the high of 488.51 in order to be called a elliot wave 3 or C wave. There are several *mini* resistance levels we must past but as I am typing, we pushed past two of them. The next important level of all is Price $200 which is surprisingly at fib level 38.2. Thats a magic number for later. We can *predict where Wave 3 may end* and that number is 504 .34- 531.72. (math not included) \n\nRefer to image: https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/cw86Lhx.jpg\nThis image basically tells me half time is over and the bell just rung. The pendant is forming or has already formed.  Its a signal and confirms the psychoanalysis of market (retail investors and all) that there is a upward movement. However, there needs to be a stimulus or break out movement out. This image now focuses on our micro analysis of wave 3 (C). Wave 1 of wave C has completed and assumingly so, wave 2 (b) of bigger wave 3 is consolidating (pendant). Quick fib analysis: We find resistance at fib level 23.6 (priced at 169.26). Then again we have fib level 38.2 hovering around price 200 (remember this - important later down the road). If we want some kind of breakout, we need to close above 200, followed by some stimulus (upward movement factor). In addition, this pendant formed a higher lows but also lower highs (consolidation). \n\nOn the daily,\n* if we close above 169-170, thats a great start\n* Then close above 200, price movement is building momentum for wave C - which should have the biggest momentum of all 5 waves\n* Theoretically, it needs to close above 351.90 to confirm wave 3(C), but remember thats only the smaller version of Wave 3. \n\nIf this happens, it can theoretically push bigger wave 5 to around 800 (depends on market volatility and demand) to XXXXs. \n\n TLDR: Wave 3's forming. There is a pressure on GME market and it may be bullish movement from now on. Consolidation may be done if it can close above micro support levels. \n\nIm not a financially literate to be a financial advisor, but just shooting blanks, i think.

Furthermore, I tried my best to make the language as simple as possible, using **ELIA**s (**E**explain **L**ike **I**'m an **A**pe) where possible, and doing my best in elaborating on difficult financial concepts and terms for this intellectually limited individuals with extraordinary small brain capacity that you all are. This work is structured in such a way so that even with zero knowledge in the subject, you will be able to grasp all of the important concepts from the first go. It is especially important for the newcomers of this sub, influx of whom might happen, should any major potential catalyst unwhale. So, do not hesitate to share this even with 1\/10 brain-wrinkled individuums. I believe in your mental capabilities apemeisters (though, I know that at this point it is a pure gamble - and I am in the right place for that).\n\nAnd yeah, this a not a financial advice, and I am not a financial advisor. Just and ape with one and a half brain wrinkles (hopefully).\n\n**LR; TD (Long Read; To Do) by Master Yoda:**\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/nz4ujbu2ujt61.png?width=487&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e45b0bcd43bd5b0247f413b1978e7e246801c41\n\nThe story addressed is as old as this world, and it involves greed, manipulation, exploitation, corruption and decay; as well as unity, bravery (abreast retardation), optimism, support and and creative forces. The eternal battle of good and evil, no matter how corny it sounds. Compulsory buckle up and eat a crayon apefriend, that's going to be a ride!\n\n# Chapter I. The Short, the Squeeze and the Ugly\n\nThe story begins with a hedge fund (HF from here on), and there is really nothing particular about this HF. For general understanding of an ape that knows nothing: \"A **hedge** **fund** is an investment partnership - the marriage of a fund manager and investors who pool their money together into the fund, with the objective of earning active return.\" - The **game** is that simple, thanks, Inve **stop** edia, you are always spot on! The HF might have been named by whichever name exists, it really does not matter for history. What is actually important, is the setting in which it operated, and the rules, according to which this HF played (and also exploited). In this particular case, the antagonist is called Melvin Capital Management LP (MC thereafter). However, I would encourage you not to get attached to names; but instead view the antagonist as a collective image, as an intrusive parasite, which appears as soon as a suitable environment exists for that. And where there is one parasite, there will come many.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\"ButT wat did di Hedgehogs do so that ther is sO mutch indiEgnation boUt t?\"**\n\nYou are asking the right questions here, my little ape-man fellow. Only the lazy haven't scolded the HF, and as a matter of fact there are solid grounds to do so. Briefly, the antagonists exploited the loophole (do not confuse with the loop hole in your head, apemeister) in the short selling mechanism, which effectively allowed them to severely manipulate the market for their benefit. Furthermore, the bad guys have been doing that for years and even decades. GME is a very indicative, even whistleblowing example of the wrongdoing being done. All of these issues will be **D**ug **D**eeper into and discussed in detail further on, but let me start from the basics for half-wrinkled beginner apes to catch up with us, one whole wrinkle elitists.\n\n**SHORT SELLING ELIA.** You are a smart entrepreneurial ape, and you obtained the information that led you to believe that the banana market will be aplenty this year (banana harvest go BBBRRRRR) and as a result the prices will drop significantly. The ape progress is so advanced, that you are able to enter a contractual relationship with another apedividual. This guy is known to have a big bulk of bananas just laying around, so you use this opportunity to borrow those for a period of time and agree to give those back later with the premium. The other ape sees you as a credible partner (understandable, as you went to Apeuke University and received MBA there - Master of Banana Appreciation degree)  thus lending you 100 bananas for one ape dollar each. You then rush to the local ape banana market 'ooh ooh ahh ahh'-ing all the way in great cheer for what a businessape apemomma raised. You sell the goods for $100 and wait. Because your due diligence was apegod-tier, the plan worked and one banana now costs 0.5 ape dollars. You then buy 100 banananas back from the market for $50 and give it back to the apelender, as well as a small premium agreed upon previously. ???? **PROFIT!!!!** (of about 50 bucks)\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/x0hwq95cujt61.png?width=503&format=png&auto=webp&s=353e830d77c215761c0b595610eac2e2e98a9c65\n\nHowever, the example above only illustrates the perfect world, where all apes are honest apes and the ape market does not have inefficiencies. The current problem with short selling is that at one moment GME had the highest percentage of float shorted in the world, amounting to about 140% (and by many it is considered to be a rookie number, even currently). Yes, it does mean that more shares were sold short than shares existed. It is a big issue, let's discuss it in detail. One important point before we dive deeper, though. Lately I saw many honorable 'traders' ( ' ' marks mean that the word is used as an anagram) in comments criticizing the short mechanism as a whole, viewing it negatively and in some extreme examples even advocating the prohibition of it. And even though,\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/xt8bt34hujt61.png?width=488&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6506e88f0d417c5c62cde5ba20cd2c7ac39b170\n\n, at this point it is important to mention that short selling is an integral part of the markets for a variety of reasons. In addition to creating liquidity to help make a market, short selling allows people to benefit from a stock price going down (as explained in the bananas ELIA above) leveling the playing field for those looking to make all types of investments. Short selling is an essential component of market stability (as long as it is not exploited, surely): hence sometimes longs are blinded by euphoria and optimism and there\u2019s no one to hold these companies' feet to the fire, short sellers look at companies with a bit more of a critical eye than the average investor. Ooh, I'm starting to sound like a \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b, so forgive me permabullapes, as I have sinned, forgetting and ignoring the only autistic postulate to live by here, and that is: \"STONKS ONLY GO UP\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\"k Shortz IMPOrTENT but hoW iZ 140% bananana sell? Ape iNfinit maniy go BrrrRrr?\"**\n\nYeah, you caught it right, smoothie-brainie. The main components to that are so-called IOUs, settlement cycles, leverage, excessive borrowing, failures to deliver, and, most importantly:\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/rgbvoyrlujt61.png?width=488&format=png&auto=webp&s=00239d43b35be1f158734b19e14fedb4be05bcf2\n\nI am sorry that your head exploded after looking at the words aforementioned above, I really am! But this is how the evolution works, and you just fell victim to it. Nevermind, just collect the shattered pieces of your brain (about two grams, should not take long), put it back into the empty vessel that your head is, and fix it with some duct tape, I dunno. Jokes aside, let's continue, and now I will explain the cornerstone concepts of IOU obligations (abbreviation of I Owe You) as well as FTDs (failures to deliver), as these will be prevalent through the entire discussion. Starting from the basics first:\n\n**IOUs ELIA**. Your ape grandma lived a busy life and she has a lot of ape-dollars as her savings. She heard about the banana price increase hype as everyone's been talking about it, so she decided to buy some for her own. Luckily, there is a decent broker called Bananality, and because she feels like really shaking the old days, she YOLOs all her savings into the bananas of BanaNonStop Corp. So far so good? \ud83d\udc3b with me. As soon as apema pays for the banana stock, the money and the bananas have to change hands, and this is called 'settlement'. In many ape countries money and bananas change hands two days after the trade, and that is called 'T+2'. Ideally, this processes have to take place simultaneously. But in the current ape financial system bananas are divorced from money, thus her money may settle independently of  bananas settlement. Before the trade settles, ape grandma will be holding banana IOUs on her account, and importantly these are IOUs for BANANAS, not for money. Furthermore, the system sees her IOUs as normal stock bananas. In the perfect ape world, the blockage does clear up after T+2, and Bananality is able to send the banana stock through the system hence the IOUs are wiped out.\n\n**Failures to Deliver (FTDs) ELIA**. Now let's imagine that apema was not so lucky in choosing her broker and ran into a crook, who wants to deliberately exploit the system of settlement and the broker is called Bananaked. The grandma enters the trade, the money settles, however, something blocks Bananaked from settling its shares through the system. And this something is nothing but a malicious intent, as all the the broker did was issuing banana IOU's with no real intention of covering it according to the rules. It might even be the case, that Bananaked never held those shares which he sold. If at the moment of T+2 settlement the IOUs are not covered by the banana stocks, it creates a deliberate, strategic failure to deliver. FTDs will be involved in the discussion later on, as these are the main vehicles through which the loophole is exploited (still, not as bad as your hole is exploited, though). Well, fuck you, Bananaked, the day will come and you will be dealt with for messing up with apema, mark my ape word!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\"My brraIn hurtz caN i go home PleZ?\"**\n\nPuts on your brain then. Just eat a banana, or a Crayon, you will be fine... Allrighty, you convinced me. Lets dive out of theory and discuss GAMEEESTOOOOP, finally! We will jump back to the concepts elaborated upon above as soon as the context is necessary for that. Here, Wen Moon got your back and he will cheer you up for your dedication to reading!\n\n[\\\\\"Camon ape ya can do it, read and evolve!\\\\\" - Wen Moon.](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/cboe9744vjt61.jpg?width=1059&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cffb0db75e9a238bd26bb7d36b2b78b509be34ec)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\"oKay i candO yit, fUkc mah braIn wit moore nowledge mtfakeRr!\"** \\- an ape.\n\nThat's the approach I needed. Remember about antagonistic MC? No, not the one who performed at your ape party last weekend and did it pretty bad. I'm talking about Melvin Capital. So, the main story line begins in 2014, the year when MC started to short the stock that I like very, very much. Gabe Plotkin, MC manager stated that fact proudly himself, during the first Congressional Hearing. There were several big fundamental reasons to bet on GME decline at that time, among which: company's debts and financial position, digitalization of the gaming industry, consoles sales \\[big part of the revenue\\] super-cycle moving away from its apex (and later on, the pandemic happened, which added dramatically to the negative sentiment). Let's take a look at the chart of GME:\n\n[GME Monthly Chart, 2014-2019 highlighted](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/fr7lat7kvjt61.png?width=2129&format=png&auto=webp&s=b93e9ba2885b5093a8687aa249fdb2dce0bc5676)\n\nAs you may see, the chart covers a relatively long period of time, and the big red REKTangle here highlights the fat and nasty, steady downward trend. From the current outlook on things, it is obvious that MC made a correct financial decision, shorting the stock from its highs of about $45 a share, all the way down to about 3-6 dollars per share diapason starting in the middle of 2019. That is a whooping gain of more than ninety(90)!!! %, or more than forty dollars per share gain! Impressive numbers, aren't they? Yeah, you won: you were right betting against the company; you've made shit tons of money; your wife's boyfriend accepted your dominance as an alpha 'trader' (anagram) ape and voluntarily left the family, now FIX YOUR FUCKING PROFITS AND CLOSE YOUR POSITION! Why did the shorters not cover when they had a perfect opportunity window for that LASTING FOR MORE THAN A FUCKING YEAR? Because of the bankruptcy jackpot.\n\nAs it was explained previously short selling is an important market instrument and it may deliver net decent profits for investors who thoroughly calibrate the risk; the 'bankruptcy jackpot' is a relatively uncommon situation which promises a much larger pay off should it occur. And it is an extremely risky bet, the one that only the epic 'traders' are willing to undertake (so, to some extent it is possible to say, that MC belongs to WSB). The HFs were driven by the fact, that in the event of insolvency, any collateral provided to back up the shorted shares has to be returned to the short seller. Furthermore, as it is no longer necessary to return the shares shorted, the shortist takes it all, the whole profit. As soon as the it became obvious for HFs that the copany should soon go buncrupt, the MHFs decided to 'help' Gamestop and invoked their dirty trick of naked short selling to the full power (the mechanism is discussed below). Before the Ryan Cohen updates, the consensus and the market sentiment on the greatest stock of all time was severely grim. So, why not go all in if you had already won it all (HF reasoning)?\n\nThey dared to YOLO, 140% or more type of YOLO...\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/8l0ujmtsvjt61.png?width=486&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a2deb71b74665b5d5395a97249941d74570a9b1\n\nAnd soon the shitshow of an unimaginable scale begins to uncover itself. But before that...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\"WatT hapenT nExt telL meh rn ya cheeKY wahnKerR!1? How dit dey YOYO?\"**\n\nEverything has its time, young padawan, don't hurry. The second half of 2020 brought several substantial catalysts for the dramatic shift of GME consensus towards being positive, accordingly, pushing the price of the stock to the upside. And to a great extent it has to be attributed to one fellow, and you all know his name. Yes, apeladies and gentleapes, this is your hero and savior, <in Leeroy's Jenkins voice> RYYYYYAAAAANN COOOOHEEEN. If by now you do not know this guy, then you can't really call yourself an ape, things don't work like that here, go and duckduckgo him or something!\n\nBy buying a big stake of GME \\[12.91% currently\\], RC (and his Ventures) brought a lot of attention to the company, giving the market sentiment a powerful bullish impulse, and then accelerating it even further by getting deeper involved into the business operation and the development of GameStop. At this point, it is fair to say, that many of the pioneering bulls were jumping into the market buying rumors.\n\n[Many, but not u\\\/DeepFuckingValue of course. This guy is out of this world.](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/v7m84mkqwjt61.png?width=486&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5bbbf5afcba1ec73751912ce860f7bc397ee640)\n\nIt is with the new updates that were being poured out of the bucket, the investors, \u2018traders\u2019 and general market participants found out that: GameStop is underway towards its digital transformation (online sales increased in 300% Q3 2020); internal restructuring bound to the new growth strategy, resulting in CFO replacement; new consoles supercycle starting with PS5 and XBox Series X\/S releases (historically very strong periods for *GME*), and many, many more under the hood developments of which we are not even aware of, or only start to find out about (just type the word 'delivery' into the search of a friendly *sub*). To conclude on that point:\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/bm94jyf0xjt61.png?width=468&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ec245cad38eb6d05c47ee5d168e5e498c45840a\n\nWhen a general market sentiment changes from negative to positive, it is usually a bad idea to bet against it. Even WSB 'traders' understand this fundamental principle (correct me if I'm wrong), and this is where you, honorable 'Trader' with capital later, started to outplay the 'Big Guys'. Literally, the  \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b HFs fell victim to their own relentless greed and stupidity, forgetting the golden trading rule that the trend is your friend until the end, and they did it spectacularly. Furthermore, instead of closing the positions and cutting the losses, they kept YOLOing and shorted more and more, in an attempt to suppress the buying pressure. And literally, now all that it takes you to show an awesome 'tradering' performance this year, is to buy, and hold.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\"Okeh ape undeErstant now GEEmeEe go BBRRRRR. How about shorts, though?\"**\n\nDafaq, you are evolving ape, look at how you are able to communicate! That's one whole correctly structured question with no 'TrAdEratIon'. Keep it up! And yeah, what about shorts? Briefly:  \n\n\n# shortz r fuk\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Short Squeeze ELIA**. Finally, it is time to discuss the most juicy squeezey piece of the puzzle. Let's refer to the short selling ELIA now. Remember how the businessape from the first ELIA happily brought the bananas to the ape market and in anticipation of the prices falling, sold his borrowed banana stock. Now, imagine that the forecast was not justified, and the things went according to the worst scenario possible: the banana harvest was poor and these became scarce; having bananas is now fashionable, and every ape wants to put their hands on what's hot; poor harvest, but because of abundant sunlight the bananas left are very delicious, so apes are ready to fight for putting it in their mouths... and etc. The businessape rushes around, panicking, begging for bananas, but these are nowhere to be found, because apemeisters hodl precious with their diamond ape hands; or, are only willing to sell 1-2 bananas for a ridiculous price of 500.000-1.000.000 ape dollars. The businessape now understands how screwed he is. He also recalls that the ape-guy he borrowed bananas from is an apemafiozi with a very bad reputation, because of punishing his failed debtors by putting LARGE bananas into their ANALysis. Fiasco, isn't it? The businessape now has nothing left to do, but to buy the banans back with any price available. Fortunately, the fortune he earned through decades of successful business is sufficient for covering his debts. And if not, you better recapitalize, ape pal, before bananas play a cruel joke on your ANALysis.\n\nApemeister! Don't hesitate to pause the reading and eat a Crayon if you need to. I know, that's a lot to digest, so take a proper care of your brain, currently working on 69420% of its capacity. Ready? Finally, this is the part where everything discussed above converges to one point. Quick ape recap: market sentimet bad, GME shortz short go BBBRRRR, Ryan Cohen buys GME to make it likable, market sentiment good, shortz r fuk, GME go BBBRRRR.\n\n**\"shortz r lit, hOew can i yoYO my BandaNas ape wAnt SHArT seLl stuCk?**\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/h225sf29xjt61.png?width=484&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c1f02665af002a608d56e21d1cbe4f2b0c98f82\n\nOh, I see you are coming back to your natural state of an ape 'trader' again. I started to worry about you evolving too fast, now we're back to normal. \ud83d\udc3b with me, this is the most interesting part.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/gnxvi3bgxjt61.png?width=487&format=png&auto=webp&s=86b3a89e5c245e5ba1a22fb09df4ac9cbb120dd7\n\nRemember IOUs, FTDs, HFs' YOLO 140% SI? Pepperidge apes remember. Ok, so, basicly short interest is a number that indicates the proportion of the shares in circulation (also called a float) sold short. Based on the businessape example, it would mean that he borrowed 100 out of 100 bananas available to being borrowed, went to the ape market and sold 140 bananas. Dafaq? How is that even possible? This is a complicated process, which I aim to discuss with a very in-**D**epth **D**ive, but in a separate post, Chapter II (as this post is voluminous enough already), alongside with dark pools, payment for order flow, sales restrictions, and other fuckeries for that matter.\n\nFor now, take a look at the following, and refer back to IOUs and FTDs ELIAs if necessary. According to T+2 settelment, the share has to be setteled no letter than two working days after the trade has been made. Before the settlement, what you hold on your 'tradering' account is an obligation for this share that you just bought - IOU. On a properly functioning market and not being exploited, T+2 has its positive effects too, providing additional liquidity to the system. However, when we talk about short selling, its effects can be destructive. Particularly, the loophole is used as an instrument to leverage the short position, without providing the adequate collateral in the short selling process which has to be, well you guessed, a share! And this process is being made three times cheaper for big players, as market makers operate based on T+6 settlement rule. That is to say, T+X makes it possible to back up your short position and create additional, artificial selling pressure by using IOUs which, in the nature of this mechanism, work as counterfeit collateral, and in its essence being nothing but\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/05e17wklxjt61.png?width=485&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b19d340a5a2d1f6ebd7af4da14cc9e953fad2ae\n\nFurthermore, if you overuse or even overabuse this mechanism (to 140% and more), you may find yourself in a very unfortunate situation, similarly, to the one that MC and shorters found themselves in. Literally, by repeating this process over and over again, they put themselves into the trap, resulting in an inability to cover the excessive amount of shares borrowed, breeding FTDs in an futile attempt to fight the buying pressure. The key point to be made here is that it is often more profitable for big market participants to pay a fine, rather than letting the FTD game get loose, because the rules and laws in this area are not strict enough. Then, when nobody looks at the problem, well, the problem goes away. \u0421ounterfeit IOUs morphing into FTDs allow shorters to manipulate the market by artificially decomposing the buying pressure, but as it is a double edged sword - there is a high chance that the accumulated compression will fucking blow in your face at the inevitable moment. Once, ONCE in the history of 'traderation', the 'BIG MONEY' YOLOd against you, respectable 'trader', and they fucking lost spectacularly. When it is obious for everybody that you lost, it is probably a good idea to cut your loses and close the positions. Can you see the beauty of their YOLO? It is almoast as good as GUH (if you don't know what it means, YT it urgently - GUH WSB!). The artificial selling pressure that is accumulating into a ticking atomic bomb is just crazy, and oh boy, would I not want to be on that side of the trade now, getting my ass torn apart by this blast, as soon as it is no longer possible to constrain it.\n\nFurthermore, and most importantly, if they can use these pesky techniques now, how do you know that they did not use that in 2014, when the initail GME mega downtrand was born? With the media being used as a manipulation instrument currently, it might have also been used as a tool to formulate the negative outlook on Gamestop starting from 2014 too... That is just crazy and mindblowing, isn't it?\n\nMore than that, many new fuckeries were revealed: RobbingHood trade restrictions, cheating with ETF's and calls, short attacks, you know the list. This is utterly unfair, so the only available option for me in this delicate situation everybody found themselves in, was to buy and hold, because I like the stock. The end. Or is it?\n\n**TL; DR:**\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/fsbyxzcqxjt61.png?width=485&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca3cd574a007fa611a3ca3a95dae07cb24f6a613\n\nMeanwhile...  \n\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/mozoqv1vxjt61.png?width=486&format=png&auto=webp&s=4cf244ce363d9717bf50e707b5be7d0ddaafd801",

You can continue to make degenerate bets if you like, but at least grasp what you're doing. \n\nFor this post, I'm going to assume *some* working knowledge of what options are, but here is link with a more basic explanation I wrote earlier: \n\n[https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/m1ahd5\/visualization\\_of\\_all\\_open\\_option\\_contracts\\_on\\_gme\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/m1ahd5\/visualization_of_all_open_option_contracts_on_gme\/)\n\n# Comparing MSFT to GME\n\nMy presumption here is that Microsoft is a stable stock where the option data trends are representative of the current state of the equity options market (or is at least is similar to other stable stocks. *Note,* *I dug through a bunch of tickers and this seemed like a reasonable assertion*).\n\n**An important note on greeks:** Looking at options in terms of the greeks is necessary to quantify how much they will change in value, especially if you're going to basket multiple options together or make complex trades. However, it seems like these statistical models may not always apply in highly volatile situations like GME. \n\nIf you're reading this and think the greeks are people from a country that makes dank meat dishes with yogurt based sauce, worry not because this information doesn't require you to really understand them. I am plotting purely in terms of absolutes. That is, **1.) How much does the option contract cost, 2.) How many people are buying it, 3.) How volatile is it?** \n\n**How do the price of GME options compare to MSFT?**\n\n[Absolute prices for the entire option chain of GME and MSFT. Options price behaviour is non-linear, making it difficult to trade based on tables\\\/numbers alone.  This was from last week, but data is collected daily. ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ipbfo81pjer61.png?width=11250&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb896e446c085da7b5ede7ca88160da4d62d7d5e)\n\nThe main take-away here is how much of a range there is with GME option prices that are out of the money. The other is how expensive GME options are. \n\nFor sake of just gaining an understanding of how options are priced, please understand that almost all option prices for most any stock will follow roughly the same trends and curves as above. This may not help us trade, but it will help you understand **why yolo'ing your savings on weeklies is a dumb idea.**  \n\n**No one is buying GME Options!!**\n\nIf you look at exactly how many contracts are out there, you will see that pretty much no one is buying GME. However, it does look like people are successfully selling way out of the money puts (probably purchased by apes on here). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Option open interest indicates nobody is buying GME options. This is likely due to their exorbitant cost and massive associated risk.](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/q3466ujtner61.png?width=12054&format=png&auto=webp&s=69c8590800ad6f0652cb7452173625f2e541448c)\n\nNotice how MSFT has a much more even distribution of puts and calls. People are betting both sides, and option strikes being bought are much closer to the stock price. \n\n**Implied volatility and why\/how thetagang makes money**\n\nImplied volatility or IV is a often not precisely defined quantitatively. It can be calculated using different options pricing models using an iterative method. However, for purposes of this writeup, you may think of **IV and demand interchangeably.** If an option has high IV, there is often corresponding demand. \n\nWhat is interesting is that IV is really high for options really close to expiry, even with Microsoft (i.e a stable stock). This would indicate that these options near expiry ***should be cheaper,*** but they're not. **There is a demand for (weeklies, FDs, yolo's whatever you want to call them)**. This would indicate that people are **buying these options to protest against sudden downswings** (historically this is the reason). **More recently, retail apes are treating weeklies like a casino**, which has likely compounded to even higher IV. \n\nThis phenomenon of high IV at extreme strikes seen for the upcoming expiry is known as the volatility smile. It was actually first notice after the crash in 1987, since people suddenly became terrified of flash crashed and began protecting themselves with cheap, way out of the money options. \n\nThetagang will sell these high IV options on a week-to-week bases to collect a small profit with a large amount of leverage (if not covered). It's also how selling covered calls can make you money. You risk getting burned if the stock price moves against you, but the higher the IV, the more upside there is to selling that option. You just go bankrupt of if you don't have the cash or stock to cover in the event things don't move your way. \n\nImplied volatility for both MSFT and GME show a volatility smile. Note GME is heavily skewed toward the out of the money side on puts, and the in the money side of calls. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/io2zsncfuer61.png?width=11250&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8cad59452807ab45e7ef7094373b7d23a402f9f\n\nNotice how GME is heavily skewed toward the out of the money side on puts, and the in the money side of calls. In my opinion, this is due to the market makers probably trying to gouge retail and\/or setting prices high to deter retail from purchasing GME options that they would need to hedge. The massive spread supports this opinion.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nGME options are expensive and some people appear to have made a tidy profit by selling way out of the money puts. This didn't require the long winded explanation given here to figure out, but I hope to have made some wrinkles in some ape brains.\n\nUse the information above, and please try to understand that options prices change non-linearly and is the reason why they feel like a lottery. Use the information above to more safely trade options (i.e. buy further out in time, expect the value of your option to drop in said time, buy closer to the money).\n\n***Most importantly, this is not investment advice. None of this is guaranteed to be accurate. Please do your own research and make your own decisions.***\n\nPositions: 100 shares of VXX and 100 shares of SQQ, getting absolutely hosed on both.

Before leaving, I had set my limit orders and then didn't have any computer access until January 29th.\n\nIn the meantime, most of my limit orders hit. When I finally got computer access on the 29th for five mins, I sold the rest of my holding.\n\nI've now been completely sober for over two months for the first time since my early teens.

I know a lot of you have your doubts about Fintel but I have a membership account and I don't believe all the data should be dismissed.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised to see that a lot of hedge funds have not fully exited their position in GameStop. If we take a look at Institutional Ownership, there have been no fully executed exited positions with Hedge Funds recently. Are other institutional investors starting to believe that the shorts are in trouble? I believe so, here's some data to back that claim up.\n\nEdit: I had to remove the screenshots from Fintel ,but I can tell by the average share of the price that the positions taken have been done recently.\n\nIf you take a look at GME stock during the dates of 25MAR2021 - 27MAR2021 and then compare that to the buys from Fintel, you can see there is a correlation. I believe that the hedge funds were coordinating an effort to surge the stock price and then drop it to deflate positivity about this stock. Unfortunately for them it did not work and GME quickly gained resistance at around the price of around 180. This leads me to believe that the available shares that they can purchase to influence the stock price is no longer significant enough to drop the price as drastically as before. \n\nEdit \\^ OR they do have enough shares to drop the price even lower but they figured out that the apes would just buy the dip. We all know that they all hedge on their shorts so they don't get margin called or are too imbalanced and prone to a huge loss in either direction. In my my opinion they will run out of capitol eventually when that is who knows? That is why I always encourage to buy shares not options. When one buys losing options you are only benefiting the market maker. In this case it would be Citadel's Market Maker Division. Where do you think those earnings go to? That's why I only buy shares with CASH NEVER on Margin.\n\nAlso a tip, use the indicator \"Accumulation\/Distribution Indicator for analyzing Charts (Indicator available in Yahoo Finance)  Anything above a +5 is usually an indicator that a stock price is going up due to buying from institutional investors. Unfortunately for now they are the only ones that have the available capital to be able to buy a stock to affect it's price that dramatically. Anything under an Accumulation\/Distribution Indicator of 0 leads me to believe that the price is going up due to retail investors buying the stock.\n\nThis is not financial advice, I just believe dearly in this stock and what it might be able to do for others in the future =)\n\nMay God Bless All of You\n\nYour Ape\/Retard",

On its current trajectory $550-750 a share is a reasonable (my worthless opinion) price point, with or without the squeeze. Not only is buying GME a play on the squeeze, but also a deep fucking value bet.\n\nFair warning, you'll develop a wrinkle of two if you proceed... but don\u2019t worry my fellow ape brethren I\u2019ve included charts, with colors, to make visualization easy. Let\u2019s walk through these figures one by one and tell the story of Gamestop\u2019s transition.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n\\*Edit\\* also see latest update (4\/1): [Our Whale is Suppressing Volatility to Bleed HFs -- Max Pain Explained](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GME\/comments\/mi1a5r\/our_whale_is_suppressing_volatility_to_bleed_hfs\/)\n\n# Chapter 1: Gamestop\u2019s Advantage in its Transition to Online.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the ugly before we get to the good stuff: **Operating Loss**. An operating loss occurs when a company's operating expenses exceed gross profits. Gamestop has had a fairly significant operating loss for many years now (peaking in 2018), as it faced the challenges all brick and mortar stores faced: theft of sales to the e-commerce giants -- the convenience of online downloads and pre-ordering on the internet. In the last two years, this loss has come down significantly. And what impresses me most about Gamestop is their cash on hand (currently $635M). Very few stores with operating losses have that level of cash. Most are in debt, and require the sale of shares to float by during rough times.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/dyyd0zf7req61.png?width=1544&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3e553bc397243f7b97702eb68d52d1a462c1431\n\nAnd this is the key misstep the HF\u2019s made in shorting Gamestop. There has been a stigma out there about brick and mortar stores going under (Toys R Us, and Sears as example)...  feeding frenzy, blood in the water you get the point. Sharks (HFs) have been getting more and more bold (reckless) in their targeting. Gamestop was the wrong target, for a very specific reason. It leases its stores. By comparison, consider Walmart needing to reduce stores, or Target. They\u2019ve built massive buildings with parking lots to house their very specific store needs (huge upfront costs, sunk), and they rent (or own) these buildings under much different contracts. They can\u2019t easily get up and leave one of their stores. Ask yourself, how would Walmart leave a store? Who would buy it? How could the investor renting to them turn it into something else? Maybe a city might want it to build an expo center. On the cheap. WalMarts costs are priced into this (it\u2019s expensive). They can\u2019t move as easily. Point being, Gamestop doesn\u2019t owe anything to shut down a store, it simply stops paying its lease and moves all it\u2019s stuff out. They rent strip mall locations and mall storefronts. This allows them to liquidate stores and downsize with little to no sunk costs. They can also reposition themselves much more efficiently. This is why we see this fast turn-around in Operating Loss last year (a major component of Operating Loss is storefront costs for Brick and Mortar). News of Gamestop closing stores isn\u2019t bad news. Remember that. The media will try to sell it as such.\n\nBecause of the focus, Gamestop is eyeing Digital Sales, for its future.\n\n# Chapter 2: Digital Sales Growth\n\nIt is clear to everyone, at this point, that Gamestop is looking to move a large portion of its business into the online space. In 2020 Gamestop did $580Million in sales online, and in Q4 alone their online sales represented over 34% of all Gamestop sales; Gamestop did more in online sales in the 4th quarter of 2020 than it did in all of 2019.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/80l9ei8breq61.png?width=1539&format=png&auto=webp&s=e16f718577f208643498038b3885b21f0e330092\n\nSo what caused this? Ryan fucking Cohen. And he\u2019s just getting started. When we see the sales in 2021 first quarter compared to 2020 the trajectory of this massive shift will become even more apparent. We have only to look at Chewy\u2019s online sales figures under Cohen to project what\u2019s to come for Gamestop in the next few years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/rg3g528dreq61.png?width=1565&format=png&auto=webp&s=c83e58af632d1e9cc06f4e1da6c7df5f9c371f5e\n\nThat\u2019s right, Chewy grew from $205M in online sales to $3,500M (17x) in 3 years under Cohen.\n\nGamestop Announced in it\u2019s Q4 earnings report last week what it\u2019s intentions are... *\u201cOur emphasis in 2021 will be on improving our E-Commerce and customer experience, increasing our speed of delivery, providing superior customer service and expanding our catalogue.\u201d*\n\nWhich brings us to our next chapter on the entire Electronics & Media space in ecommerce -- let's make sense of what potential exists for growth in this sector...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Chapter 3: Electronics & Media Sales\n\nIf you ever wondered where Amazon makes all it\u2019s money. Look no further than the category of Electronics & Media (Gaming, computers, electronics, digital media). In 2020 the company did 120.9 Billion in sales, and 54.6% of that fell into this category. There are plenty of other players in this space, but only Apple is close to Amazon\u2019s market share. Here is a chart to visualize the largest players (Gamestop is #10 currently with their 2020 sales, the tiny orange slice):\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/im8t7lwfreq61.png?width=1529&format=png&auto=webp&s=52e086ce497c34d9e352cfed9fce99f50d2ce723\n\nAmazon itself projects this space to grow 34.2% in the next two years. Meaning roughly $40B in new Electronics and Media sales will emerge in the online space for these companies to grow into over the next two years. Might be a good time to mention that Gamestop listed GPUs for sale on it\u2019s website earlier this week, and they sold out instantly. With Gamestop doing $580M in online sales in 2020, and most of that coming in Q4 it is safe to say Gamestop is positioned to grab onto this space in a way that will shake Amazon\u2019s growth models for the next two years. Have you noticed how Ryan Cohen is leaning on his Amazon (and Chewy) relationships to pull talent to go after this space. If chewy is any indication, I wouldn\u2019t bet against him eventually grabbing a large percentage, even the majority, of it.\n\nSo let\u2019s get to the fun part\u2026 valuation\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Chapter 4: What is Gamestop Worth?\n\nValuations are a funny thing. Companies are only worth what people think someone else will pay for it in the future. Often we start with fundamentals, but in the end, hype and excitement over growth and continued growth leads to higher and higher valuations. I\u2019ll start with a simple comparison just to prove a point.\n\nGamestop ($12B Market Cap) and Roblox ($36B Market Cap)\u2026 we\u2019re all gamers here, right? We know what Roblox is, right? Two completely different companies, but let\u2019s look at the figures anyway and then I\u2019ll get back to comparing GME to the online retail giants. Roblox did $920Million in revenue in 2020 (up from $435Million in 2019), and it\u2019s valuation rose from $4B to $36B. Hmmm\u2026 why? Well, it went public. IPO is a great way to hype a stock. Get people excited, maximize valuation, so those angel investors can finally get paid off. So how does this compare to Gamestop (minus the hype of an IPO). Well Gamestop did $6,466Million in revenue in 2020. Yep, seven times what Roblox did? So why the major difference in Market Cap? Well for one, Roblox has very few employees and no stores to spend money on (is this tickling that little feeling you have about Gamestop\u2019s move to becoming primarily an online ecommerce giant, it should be). If Gamestop were valued the same as Roblox, right now\u2026 it would move it\u2019s price to approximately $5,157 a share. That\u2019s not a squeeze number. That\u2019s simply an IPO hyped valuation number on growth. Gamestop is moving that direction, minus the IPO, but they are aiming to grow (like Chewy did).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ipbngvoireq61.png?width=1519&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a35214d7048744cd86debfee8cedda28b748b0f\n\nSo let\u2019s get a better comparison to the other giants. Apple, Amazon Chewy, Target, Walmart and Best Buy. I\u2019ve chosen these because they represent a wide range of Brick and Mortar vs ecommerce. Price to Sales Ratio is calculated by dividing the company's market capitalization by the revenue, this gives a general sense of how much the market is going to value a company relative to its revenue. Value players (like Buffet) are often looking for the lowest P\/S ratio to enter for a fundamentally solid company, and companies with a lot of growth potential and hype can grow their P\/S ratio (similar to P\/E ratio) to levels that are very high. One thing you\u2019ll notice in this chart. The more online a company is, the higher it\u2019s P\/S ratio can go. This directly impacts the Valuation of the company. While companies that may be online, but still rely most heavily on their stores, have a lower P\/S because they have a lot of overhead costs. You\u2019ll notice Gamestop in the middle, because it\u2019s transitioning to ecommerce. Last year you would have seen Gamestop with a P\/S similar to Best Buy and Walmart. The reason this is important is because as Gamestop grows it\u2019s online business, it\u2019s P\/S is likely to rise, and moving to the Amazon level would represent a share price of roughly double what we currently see for Gamestop, while not changing anything about it fundamentals.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Final Chapter: Conclusions\n\nOk you\u2019ve been patient, and I told you I\u2019d eventually get to what Gamestop is worth currently, and next year (projection). What the market hasn\u2019t caught onto yet, that we all see in Gamestop is it\u2019s deep fucking value. So what is Gamestop worth, right now?\n\nWell **$191**, that\u2019s what it\u2019s trading at. It\u2019s only worth more, when people see these numbers and get excited about them. The numbers show that Gamestop is growing exponentially with its online sales and Ryan has brought on a team to accelerate that growth. I don\u2019t know what Q1 numbers are, but I can guess a lot of Apes, are really excited about Gamestop, and becoming more and more loyal to its brand. I know I wouldn\u2019t buy anything from Amazon, that I could get from Gamestop right now, even if it costs slightly more. It\u2019s because of quality, and support for the brand.\n\nLots of things are increasing Gamestop\u2019s valuation, but growth of it\u2019s online sales will be the most significant one. What most analysts are ignoring (or simply missing, if I\u2019m giving them some credit) is just how massive Gamestop\u2019s online sales growth were last year, despite the pandemic. If we project Q4 numbers onto 2021, and ignored the dream team Cohen has brought on board, one can expect 3-4 times as much in online sales next year. That will tip P\/S higher and people will stop seeing Gamestop as a failing brick and mortar and recognize it for what it is\u2026 an Amazon killer, going after an $88B market in Electronics & Media by 2023. On top of that, growing an esports brand (I suspect) that will engulf a $200B annual industry that is likely to only grow to $300B by 2023.\n\nProject these figures onto Gamestop as you\u2019d like. I\u2019ll take a stab at it. Right now Gamestop should be valued at $662 a share, based on it\u2019s Q4 figures and projection into 2021 from it\u2019s finish in 2020 Q4. By this time in 2023, we will see Gamestop at a $50B valuation from $12.5B in sales, and a P\/S in the 4.0 ballpark - that puts it\u2019s per share price at $795 - conservatively without hyper on the growth (that you know will amplify that by another factor of 2-3). How do we justify a growth from 580M to $12.5B in two years\u2026 Ryan fucking Cohen is how. Multiple current sales by 17. Go back and look at that Chewy graph if you\u2019re wondering how that\u2019s possible. There is a gaping hole in the Electronics ecommerce side of the market, growing. Amazon and Gamestop can both grow incredibly without stealing from one another\u2026\n\nI have another DD in the works on The Squeeze (no dates, no times) and a look at how high we might go (spoiler, there is no accurate answer, but there is a lot to look at, and be excited about to try to make educated guesses).\n\nHere is a teaser\u2026 When Volkswagen Squoze, it temporarily became the most valuable company in the world. Gamestop doing the same, would put it\u2019s price north of $31,800 on it\u2019s way to the moon (not that we heard a bell yet as we flew by that mark).\n\nIf you needed one more reason to HODL, it\u2019s this\u2026 you will be at least 4 times richer a few years from now, even if you went into a Comma and your wife\u2019s boyfriend lost your password couldn\u2019t get to that sell button on the way down from the squeeze, because at $191 a share, GME is still a deep fucking value play squeeze aside.\n\nAnd if you\u2019ve ever wondered how Phineas and Ferb pay for their projects\u2026 I think I figured it out\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/28tift4lreq61.png?width=1303&format=png&auto=webp&s=105caf042c76cb6607783b29773e179b2bd1aa45\n\nPlease Be Good To Each Other Out There.\n\nBehind these names we are all humans and we all have our own stories.

        "866":"Biden's Infrastructure Plan and BLNK moon potential? Preface:\n\n- Not trying to draw attention away from GME right before take off. Pos: 200 @ $80 avg \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 and \ud83d\udc8e\u270b\n- I realize that not every play or high short interest is a squeeze...\n\nBut serious question:\n\n- Biden will be proposing an infrastructure plan next Wednesday, March 31 and there seems to be speculation that a significant portion of the 3 to 4 trillion dollar plan will be devoted to clean energy initiatives, including the electrical grid, charging stations etc. I realize this could take months if not longer to pass and the final results could be quite different but could this create some potential for companies like BLNK?\n\n- BLNK exhibits conditions that are similar to GME in the sense that short interest is quite high (Short % of Float is 37.99% as of March 15) and the float is relatively low 30.87 M. Again, I realize it is not the same situation as GME as there may be other variables at play but just curious as to  any opinions and thoughts on this?\n\nNo positions yet.\n\nThank you all.",

If this doesn't work, I'll stay where I was at. Send me a message if you see this disappear.\n\nThank you all for your help! I didn't leave WSB on purpose, automod just doesn't like me.\n\nCurrent price: 223.61\n\n**12:26 Update**\n\nGME did break 220 again and has been hanging around 222. We'll see if there's another attack if GME continues to go up. There is a Gamma Squeeze Threshold, but we don't know where that price range is at. If they attack again, it might tell us where the SHITs think that threshold is at.\n\nCurrent price: 224.04\n\n**11:31 Update**\n\nThank you to everyone for their support. I'm honored to be able to provide content that is worthy to you wrinkle brained Apes. I am trying to find a way to do this for a living. If I can make enough money on GME, I'm going to start an investment firm, hire some smart people to do research and analysis, and share all of that knowledge on Reddit for stocks y'all find interesting. I would continue to do live threads while managing an account for people who want the fun of WSB but don't know what they're doing.\n\nI'm currently planning on applying to Harvard so I can share all of their knowledge to you all so that Reddit can continue to become smarter investors.\n\nGME has stalled around 217. Though as I'm writing this update, I'm seeing a fast change in trajectory moving up so maybe it's moving?\n\nCurrent price: 218.85\n\n**11:08 Update**\n\nTwo small attacks, two small recoveries. They might be using smaller attacks to bring GMEs price down this morning. We may be at the start of a 3rd attack, so don't be surprised by another dip. They still haven't hit the Red yet, so we'll see if they accomplish that now.\n\nCurrent price: 215.96\n\n**10:40 Update** \n\nAnother attack. It started at almost the same price point as the other one. They're stratified with the stock been in the green though as they seem to stop before it gets to red. This tells me that they fear the Gamma Squeeze. They seem to be trying to avoid the 230 area. If we get there today, we'll see if that ignites a rocket.\n\nCurrent price: 214.00\n\n**10:16 Update**\n\nWe're almost top 25 here! I appreciate all of your support so far. I hope I can prove to be a post worthy to be near the top of this sub.\n\nThe attack is over and GME bounces back. GME is currently up 6% and seems to have some momentum. If they fire again though, that'll tell us if there's a price point they fear GME crossing. That's probably Gamma Squeeze territory.\n\nCurrent price: 220.96\n\n**10:08 Update**\n\nThis isn't a stall, this is a full on attack. SHITs apparently still have ETF shorts to fire. Unless they start driving GME into the Red though, those are just more shorts that need to be bought in \ud83e\udd37.\n\nThey could be trying to prevent a Gamma squeeze from happening. My dumb stab in the dark guesses that it would take pushing the price up to 250 or 280 to trigger a Gamma Squeeze, but these attacks might signal that that threshold might be a bit closer.\n\nI'll look closer and keep y'all updated.\n\nCurrent price: 220.00\n\n**10:03 Update**\n\nGME has stalled for a bit at around 220. Don't be surprised of this happening. The only way we go consistently up is when we hit Gamma Squeeze territory. For now, we have to rely on good old buying power. As shorts get covered, whales jump in, or stimulus checks start pouring in, we'll continue to see moments of growth sporadically throughout the day. Once we hit Gamma Squeeze territory, the engine should ignite.\n\nCurrent price: 219.14\n\n**9:41 Update**\n\nAfter a beating yesterday, GME comes out swinging out of the gate, flying upwards to 8% . GME is on SSR and they used a lot of shorts through ETFs yesterday, so I don't know how they stop this momentum. If GME can hit a Gamma Squeeze threshold, today could be insane.\n\nWhere's that threshold? I'm sure there are some wrinkle brains here that can figure that out for me. If y'all can give me the proof, I'll post it here.\n\nCurrent price: 224.47\n\n**9:25 Update**\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 Premarket\n\nThis might mean a really strong start for GME.

I'm working on a solution over there and will let you know if I migrate there.\n\nI'm sorry I don't have candles or cups for you all. I know the standards here are pretty high, but I'm a smooth brained ape. I just hope that my removal from WSB doesn't cause undue panic.\n\nGME is officially green in pre-market. Let's see if this continues into opening bell.\n\nCurrent price: 214.00\n\n\n**8:20 Update**\n\nI'm making my own post in case this post gets removed in the WSB Megathread. If I can't make things work at WSB, I'll stay here again today.\n\nPremarket, GME has stayed steady. I don't see the type of attacks we saw yesterday premarket. That doesn't mean that things won't light up once markets open. \n\nCurrent Price: 203.01\n\n**8:03 Update**\n\nIt seems that my posts are still getting auto-deleted. I've removed all links. Please let me know if this posts gets removed again. I'm trying to figure out a solution before the GME Megathread comes online.\n\nCurrent Price: 204.12\n\n**7:42 Update**\n\nNew format!

Why weren't you on WSB?**\n\nI thought I got myself banned from WSB, so I made my comments elsewhere. I wasn't banned, I just had something in my post that forced it to get autoremoved. There is no conspiracy. WSB mods did nothing wrong. They reached out to me and told me they enjoy my comments. I'm just really smooth brained. I'm going to be more careful about what types of links I put in my posts.\n\n**Wow, you're really smooth brained, but where did you go?**\n\nMy fellow Apes, on Monday, I came to spread the good word, but found that my words were not heard. I figured that my time on WSB was done, so I ventured into other parts of Reddit to find a new home. What I found was a small city of wrinkle brained apes dedicated to GME. Their Daily Megathread recommended that comments like mine be their own separate posts, so I made my own post. Everything was normal, except for my new surroundings. Many of my usual apes were able to find me and I made some new ape friends along the way. I missed being on WSB, but I was content having a home.\n\nWhen I had a chance to check my surroundings, I came to learn just how smooth brained I was. I am used to crayons and bananas, but these apes spoke of candles and cups with handles. Many spoke with words that hurt my small brain, but they all seemed to be convinced that the reckoning was at hand. I spent my time reading and learning, trying to understand GME in a way I never understood before.\n\nI am still a smooth brained ape, but I hope that I can share some of the knowledge those wrinkle brained Apes taught me.\n\n**Corno4825, what did you learn?**\n\nSHITs can manipulate GME through ETFs. ETFs are essentially stocks that represent a collection of stocks. How this works is that there are people who will buy and sell shares of the stocks that comprise the ETF when someone buys or sells the ETF. The strategy involves shorting the ETF, but buying all of the stocks that comprise the ETF except for GME. The people who manage the ETF will sell the stocks including GME. The net change is that only GME is sold. It's complicated, but I've seen the math and charts and am convinced that this works.\n\nThat was the attack that we saw yesterday even though GME was on the SSR list. However, that ammunition is also limited and those shorts also have to be bought back in. With the recovery the GME made yesterday following the attack, I believe it is in a much stronger squeeze position strictly because of the amount of shorts that were used that need to be bought back in.\n\nThere are many wrinkle brained Apes that believe that the total shorts in circulation equal over 200% of the float. There is a lot of math involved which I do not understand, but many other wrinkle brained Apes agreed with the assessment. There was also a post from a Bloomberg Terminal that showed that Institutions by themselves held 115% of Gamestop shares.\n\n**Corno4825, what does this mean?**\n\n* Millions of shorts still need to be covered.\n* The SHITs are running out of ammo.\n* Stimulus checks still haven't kicked in.\n* Earnings report is coming next week.\n* GME is still up over $150 from where it was 3 weeks ago.\n* If you're still holding on after everything you've experienced the past week, what could possibly scare you now?",
        "869":"Do we have ANY info, or is there ANY outcome, that is not favorable for us? [GME] Hello there, fellow apes.\n\nI'm here to ask a question that has been with me for quite a long time. The deeper we are with buying and HODLing $GME, the less I'm seeing reasonable bearish posts or comments about that stock (to be exact, I'm seeing none). I'm really trying my best to find any negative analysis on our fucking moon-rocket on WSB and other $GME-related subreddits and I'm not really finding shit. \n\nI've been reading many DDs, Technical Analyses, Discussions, you name it.\n\nFor example, this seems solid and explains much about short selling and why they shorted Geee Emm Eeeee in the first place:\n\n[https:\/\/iamnotafinancialadvisor.com\/discord\/DD\/GMEv10.pdf](https:\/\/iamnotafinancialadvisor.com\/discord\/DD\/GMEv10.pdf)\n\nWhat bothers me is this: Is this possible by mods deleting all the bearish stuff about $GME, or is it really that good? I mean ALL (99%) of bearish stuff can be found on CNBC, Jim Cramer's babbling and others, but here? NONE of that gets any recognition. All I saw here on WSB, was a post saying that we should keep putting pressure on them by buying options with a strike price closer to the current price, and just putting all we can afford in shares.\n\nIs it really a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and not pouring our whole savings in it is plain stupid? I'm a college freshman and I poured everything I can in it (that I can afford to lose), but is it worth just fucking pouring in EVERYTHING? If there's no bad outcome, except a fucking miraculous save by the government, or some DFV's evil clone appearing on the other side out of thin air, why is it not on the moon yet? Is it that people don't understand the stuff going on with GameStonk and that's the reason behind not going in? I'm seriously running out of ideas what could go wrong with that. \n\nAs far as I understand, the HFs are just kicking the can down the road in hopes for the company falling. They just keep shorting the company, bleeding money on paying premiums to their brokerages. Correct me if I'm wrong, but to me, that's like postponing the inevitable death! They're making it a fucking nightmare for who'll have to cover the shorts for them when they inevitably run out of money and the squeeze finally hits.\n\nI mean, what the fuck? It's that I'm not understanding something, or they are more retarded than the whole WallStreetBets community combined.\n\nAnd no, I'm not complaining about being a millionaire if it hits 100k, I'm here with my 6 shares and holding. (where I live a US dollar is 3.87 in our currency rn)\n\nTL;DR why can't I find any bearish posts on GME ANYWHERE besides the news? And we know that news are connected directly to HFs, so that's just bullshit and won't make any sense. I wanted to get some reasonable thesis about $GME not mooning, but no success.",

FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. *See* Disclaimer at the End of Post. \n\n**TL:DR:** **Buy GME this week for the POP next week.** As of yesterday's closing price of 208.14 and current open interest, 3.245 million shares are in-the-money for options expiring tomorrow. That is 6% of the entire inventory of GME shares out there. The pop will come next week when they will need to deliver on these shares by next Wednesday. The higher GME closes on Friday, the more it will hurt. \n\nSummary: \n\n1. Total Exposure to short positions on options is decreased slightly to **$2.5 billion** from $2.6 billion the day before--a 4% decrease. The share price went down by almost 6% so this is a slight **bullish** sign indicating that investors put  more money in ITM call options betting that the price will go up. *See* Figure 1 and Table 1. \n2. Exposure for just the the options expiring Friday is **$889 million** down from $924 million--a 4% decrease**.** This is another slight **bullish** signal--they think it's going up by Friday. *See* Table 1. \n3. The Number of Shares needed to cover all short positions on options decreased slightly to **11.6 million (21% of total float)** from 12.1 million (22% of float). *See* Figure 2 and Table 1. \n4. The Number of Shares (or equivalents) needed to cover Friday's short option positions--alone--is relatively unchanged at **3.245 million (6% of total float)** down from 3.394 million (6% of float). *See* Table 1. \n5. The \"Minimum Exposure Point\" for this Friday's options decreased to 150. *See* Table 2. This is a bearish sign in one sense because it indicates that our short positions on the options will do what they can to push the price to $150. This a bullish sign in a different sense because it indicates that money is going into calls such that the shorts on the options need to push the price lower to break even. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/wtv7voax6ln61.png?width=1368&format=png&auto=webp&s=da76d255fa895d29b253b22187d781680d719708\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/sqajs7507ln61.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6dddca60e9be57c4e70d23bce73d221502ff961\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/deg196o37ln61.png?width=587&format=png&auto=webp&s=22f72bcf496a037322580e2d705680dab89db88a\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/q5c3flv67ln61.png?width=518&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7f62411351adb0ce2224d22713f8c159797bb45\n\nLIMITATIONS\/WEAKNESSES\/BACKGROUND:\n\nThis is the result of a thought experiment asking a simple question: If a hypothetical single actor\/market maker was on the short side of all open options in GME, which means that he cannot simultaneously hold any long positions himself, what would that single actor's exposure be in terms of dollars? How many shares would that single actor need to find to cover all of the short positions?\n\nNote that this does not represent this market maker's \"loss.\" To sell an option, this hypothetical market maker received a premium as it does not take into account the premium the actor received for taking this short position.\n\nAlso, it also assumes that the actor has not already started purchasing\/selling shares on the open market to cover short positions.\n\nFinally, a major weakness of this curiosity is that, by its nature, it precludes the use of other long option positions to cover their short positions (since this hypo is set up with one guy being short on everything). In reality, we have multiple market makers who are constantly hedging themselves with other option contracts in the variety of neutral option strategies that exist for all options traders.",

(AGAIN, MORE THAN 10 FUNDS HOLDING!!!)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/wafpsnospkn61.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ece3f06ab8b75fe98d4ce634f27519a164bb4688\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/rilgsqospkn61.jpg?width=1238&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5c6aef09412e03df965499dea636dd87f1797d3e\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/gqdmbmrspkn61.jpg?width=1240&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8b9e581bb774f4273d1ed6d129e1874213d19a4b\n\nAs suggested by [desertrock62](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/desertrock62\/), RC Ventures 9M has been repeatedly calculated, here I remove this data.\n\nThe total number of these TWO types of shareholdings is : (M is short for million, million)\n\n(140.70 M-26.21M) + (23.35M-9M) = 128.24 M\n\nGME FLOAT SHARES: 69,750,000 , calculated as 70 M ;\n\nGME FREE FLOAT SHARES: 46,920,000 ,calculated as 47M ;\n\nQ: The number of total outstanding shares is only 70 M, so where did these additional 85.05M shares come from?\n\nSynthetic or shadow GME stocks sold by HFs through shorting will be bought by retail investors and bulls, so B who bought the shadow stock and A who lent the stock claimed ownership of the stock at the same time, which will lead to double counting of the same stock.\n\nThe total number of shares held MUST BE HIGHER THAN 155.05M, which is calculated on the basis of shorting the same GME stock and selling once (if the same stock is shorted multiple times, the SI will be even higher). The number of stocks that short sellers need at least Short:\n\n128.24M \u2013 70 M = 58.24 M\n\nThe Float Short Interest calculation formula of GME is as follows:\n\nFloat Short Interest = Short shares \/ Free float share \\* 100%\n\nBring in data:\n\nFloat Short Interest = 58.24 M \/ 47M \\* 100% = 123.91%\n\nThis means that at least 1.2 times the number of outstanding shares is needed to close the position.\n\nCHEERS TO DIAMOND HANDS!\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\n\nAPES TOGETHER STRONG!\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\n\nNote: I am not a financial advisor.

Shouldn\u2019t be counted as institution. Possible double count, as the other board members don\u2019t own that much. Mostly Sherman.------------RC Ventures 9M has been removed.\n\nEDIT 2: ([dontkillchris](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/dontkillchris\/))The problem is, if you actually add the number of shares of the top10 institutional owners that are shown there, you don't even get to 100 million shares, and, as somebody else said, some of them are counted twice.--------------The data is automatically added up by FINRA, don't know why it's not consistent but still worth calculating. The other stocks like AM-C don't have such problems.\n\nEDIT 3: I found I can't reply to all of your comments, so I can only edit my post here. Is it because my account is quite new and has certain restriction?\n\nEDIT 4:([bakebakingbaked](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/bakebakingbaked\/)) But also doesn\u2019t take ETFs into consideration-------Yes, maybe not included, so I say it's at least 180% !\n\nEDIT 5:([AlexCormier1144](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/AlexCormier1144\/))Hey Zach. Thanks for the DD. Where did you get the 40 M from? How accurate is that number? Depending how accurate it is it could swing the SI by a good margin. Cheers!--------The 40M data is what I got by chance here in Reddit, look at the figure that shows the reddit website, but I lost track of the original post.\n\nEDIT 6: I am in ASIA now, so due to the time difference I will not be able to reply you in time. My calculation just provide you some kind of thoughts. FINRA is the most trustful source as for me. Even FINTEL has been caught cheating in the daily short volume data months ago. Sure I admid my calculation does exist little error, but they will not change the fact that the SI is too too high for the HFs to cover. No matter how to adjust, the real SI should be much much higher than 100%!\n\nEDIT7: Naked Shorting has been changed as \"shorting\".\n\nEDIT8:([Nomadic8893](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/Nomadic8893\/))whats the diff between Finra figures and your figures? why are they showing 50% and you 300%--------------The FINRA SI were reported by the HFs themselves. They can surely cheat, the consequence may only be fined for that cheating. The 300%+ calculation were calculated via the SEC reports of GME long positions, should be much more accurate!\n\nEDIT 9\uff1aMy account has been ban for commenting (Weired)! Will create another new account TMR!\n\nEDIT10\uff1aPosition figure removed.\n\nEDIT11: IN ORDER TO DELETE THE REPEATED COUNTED SHARES, I WILL ONLY USE THE INSTITUTIONAL AND FUNDS DATA FOR CALCULATION. AGAIN, THIS ONLY PROVIDES A THOUGHT FOR CALCULATION, THE FINAL SI IS SO DAMMED HIGH!!!\n\nEDIT12: I CAN'T CHANGE THE TITLE, IF POSSIBLE I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE IT AS \"180% SHORT VOLUME\" WHICH IS STILL GOD DAMMED HIGH!!!\n\nEDIT 13: THIS ACCOUNT CAN NO LONGER REPLY THE COMMENTS, FIND ME @[u\/ZACK0806cool](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/ZACK0806cool\/) THIS ACCOUNT WILL MAKE FURTHER EDITS AND I WILL TRY TO POST THIS REFINED VERSION THROUGH THAT NEW ACCOUNT!\n\nEDIT 14:Fidelity is listed 3 times.

Although I\u2019ve only got 6 shares in this GME roller coaster ride, I still consider myself an ape on the sidelines in this whole fiasco. It\u2019s been such a crazy last couple of months and I honestly haven\u2019t had this much (internet) excitement in my life. \n\nThis is the very first and only stock that I\u2019ve ever purchased and although I don\u2019t know shit about stocks (I understand the concept but that\u2019s it), this is something I\u2019ll never forget. I\u2019m happy for everyone who\u2019s lives have changed for the better and it\u2019s heart warming to see the good that this place does as far as charity. \n\nBut I\u2019m gonna be a negative Nancy ape for a bit. You guys saw it. You guys are seeing it. We\u2019re all watching it live. How manipulative media outlets are. How quick they are at shooting their arrows. How our government basically just gave us an amateur horse and pony show when they \u201cquestioned\u201d that Bosnian whatever the fuck from Robindahood. They tried to grill our boy DFV more than any of them. It really pissed me off watching that. \n\nThey tried throwing attention away from GME (silver anyone? lol). They tried attacking this place. They tried attacking day traders. They tried attacking DFV. They tried every single thing they could and failed. I truly believe it\u2019s because of the good intent in this sub that helped. That and you guys are seriously stupid as fuck. \n\nI mean, I know the cliche of \u201cnever trust the news,etc\u201d but to be watching it live is just....I mean fuck. If you can\u2019t see it by now you\u2019re obviously on the other side. Not only is no one going to be held accountable, more than likely they\u2019ll just change up the rules to punish the \u201clittle guys\u201d. It really shows us whose best interest our government and media favor. \n\nYou honestly couldn\u2019t write a better scenario on exposing these slime balls. A fucking store that buys and sells used video games. A dude that seems like he\u2019d make Keanu Reeves look like an asshole and goes by the name Roaring Kitty on YouTube and DeepFuckingValue on Reddit exposed them; but not because he wanted to fuck them over, but because he saw the value in it and liked the stock lol. \n\nIt\u2019s perfect.\n\nTLDR;the media sucks",

Stock price was \\~260 USD last week, and 800$ was \\~3x the stock price. When a strike price of 3x the stock price is so high for the MM that they don't cover their calls, THEN why should they cover those 200$+ calls when the stock price was 40$ three weeks ago. At 40$ Stock price a call of 200$ would have been 5x the stock price back then, and therefore WAY out of the money. So I really think there are a lot of naked calls expiring this Friday, so shit will hit the fan for the shorters when they become exercised.If there's some Pro here who can clarify the MMs covering process I'd be grateful.",

I am sure it was quite painful to watch each dip go up rather than down in your favor. Must be tough shorting a stock only to know now more have bought it and to cover is just going to take longer.\n\nHave you not learned? Honestly, even a retard can tell when you have nowhere to go. You are completely trapped in your own cycle of shorting the stock and hoping it has a sell off. Literally it is like a nightmare you cannot escape.\n\nThink about it, all you had to do was buy to cover. Seriously, it wasn't difficult the first time but you just had to make sure that the little lose right?\n\nThe little guys have been losing all their life, while you're used to seeing greens in your portfolio and thinking to yourself about how stupid the retards are for getting into a fair \"stock\" market and that anyone can become rich.\n\nI'm not trying to make you mad, I just think you are at this point; fighting a losing battle. I do however, sympathize with you. Only a little bit. You just haven't seen the amount of depression in your life yet to know that it is actually normal to actually lose money. In a fair market, that's how it should have been in the first place.\n\nThe thing is you should have covered when we said GME to $1000, honestly, this could have been the best decision of you life. You were losing peanuts to what you could have made back in 5 years or less with all that great manipulation. You were changing a few percentage of peoples lives for the better. It that couldn't make you feel better about losing money, then nothing will.\n\nBut seriously, instead you tried and mess with the massive amount of retardation that I haven't seen in years. You really don't know how millennials yet think do you?\n\nHint: WE DON'T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT ANYTHING\n\nNo matter how long it takes, you bet that no one is selling at a $1000 at this point. I don't think anyone will ever sell for the price you are going to offer.\n\n**Next my fellow retards,**\n\nHDOL! Nothing more left to say. Keep buying dips and wait. Just wait. It will happen.

If you want to change that, I recommend you read the free book [here](https:\/\/www.elliottwave.com\/Free-Reports\/Elliott-Wave-Principle). But since I know that most of you are too busy eating crayons I'm going to summarise it quickly.\n\nA rare recording of Ralph Nelson Elliot's early days.\n\nAs you can see, our fellow \ud83e\udd8d Ralph already had a real hunger for tendies as a little kid. That hunger drove him to use his crayons on charts until he discovered in the 1930s that the stock market always moves in recognizable patterns back, so-called \"waves\".Simplified there are only two types of waves:\n\n1. Impulse\n2. Corrective\n\n**Impulsive Waves**\n\nThose are always waves that move the market and consist of five sub-waves because five is the smallest number of waves that can accomplish an overall movement.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/7zcxlzn7ohn61.png?width=535&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c7d5d431d351b8011ef4a5b4fa4fb123b4ee064\n\nImpulsive Wave on GME Weekly Chart\n\n**Corrective Waves**\n\nAlthough there are a few different corrective patterns we can say in general that they consist of three waves because that's the smallest number needed to achieve a retracement.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/bf1arfybohn61.png?width=382&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7503b533893b2ab4b05ddc4ac04df20675939cf\n\nCorrective Wave on GME Daily Chart\n\n*There are a few special cases, and obviously overall more to learn about it, otherwise, there would hardly be an entire book about it.*\n\nBefore we now take our colorful crayons and applied that mindblowing knowledge on GME there are a few other things you should understand:\n\n1. Each wave can and should contain waves in itself. \ud83e\udd2f I know... Sounds complicated, and often is, but to give you a simple example, in the 1-2-3-4-5 Impulsive wave above, you'd be able - possibly not on the monthly chart but on weekly or lower - to also fit another 1-2-3-4-5 between 2 and 4.This way you can confirm if your patterns are actually valid.\n2.

Both of those aspects show a correction into the current range, although we haven't reached the predicted range for C in the A-B-C pattern (and maybe won't, but I wouldn't be surprised if the price falls into the range of $131-$161 to confirm both predictions and possibly also close the gap that's still open from the 5th to the 8th of March at $140.50).This would mean that we are likely at the end of wave #2 within a 1-2-3-4-5 Impulse.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/vpssstgmohn61.png?width=1854&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a82de9fedbea728b56c48befb504dfbb90ee00b\n\n\ud83d\ude80 Pre-Launch\n\nNow, the projection for the following wave 3-4-5 looks like this and already gets us into the range of $10,231 to $13,382 - at which point we'd see a corrective pattern (A-B-C), which IMHO is very likely since a few \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\ude4c bitches would likely sell their shares at that price and HFs obv. will also try to create a drop at a price point like this to make it appear as if the MOASS is already over.\n\nHowever, as mentioned earlier, each wave consists of waves, so the 1-2-3-4-5 Impulse you can see in the image above is actually just wave #3 in the bigger 1-2-3-4-5 Impuls that began during the all-time low of GME. Confirming the highlighted pattern, and also confirming that we are likely going to see a correction\/retracement\/sell-off at that level. And that Corrective pattern would be wave #4 in the bigger Impulse, and after that, we will see our \ud83d\ude80 fly. It's hard to say how far right now, but personally I expect to see $130k per share, possibly more.\n\nNow, as said, all of that is just my opinion and not financial advice.\n\n**TL;DR IMHO GME will go short-term to around $2,000 at which point we'll see a small retracement and then we'll move to our pre-launch stage at $10,000 per share, followed by a drop to as little as $7,000 per share, followed by the \ud83d\ude80 take-off to $100,000 or more per share.

        "877":"When there is max pain there is max profit. I posted a DD about the potential gamma and short squeeze on RKT last night. Here\u2019s my update after today\u2019s fuckery. \n\nReal quick disclaimer. I get hype in my posts because that\u2019s what I provide; excitement, facts, and encouragement. I\u2019m doing this because sometimes we need to vent together and re-evaluate the game plan. I get up at 4am every morning, pop an addy and hope for the best\/expect the worst. This is why I\u2019m hype, take it or leave it. I also don\u2019t have a job right now. I used to sell mortgages and made a lot of money so now I fucking work my ass off to learn everyday and make a living day trading. Not financial advice.\n\nFirst, let me discuss the elephant in the room. We were so fucking close. RKT was pushing and flagging and ready too moon after its third attempt above 27. That\u2019s the most frustrating part. There was no volume after that so I repositioned lower when I saw the whole market tanking, not just RKT. Here we go again...The VIX (volatility index) has been below 20 this week and bears have raped meme stocks taking advantage of this. I\u2019m sitting there getting pissed off because it\u2019s like every boomer out there needs to suck J. Powell\u2019s D Thursday before deciding if they like a stock or not. They bow down until hedgies decide what they want to do....pussies. Fuck em. The opportunity was there and some wales got in today for sure, but not enough. WSB also didn\u2019t help much because a majority of you think RKT is a distraction from GME. If we just broke 27 we were going to rocket this stock to Mars. I was getting mad at my fellow apes because I imagined you guys sitting there with your dick in your hands waiting for your stimi to come in, and knowing that most of you didn\u2019t know how close we were. It was right there. Then I saw something.\n\nThe whole market tanked AS SOON AS GME WENT GREEN. It\u2019s comical honestly. Gme is basically a new index. It\u2019s like citadel called in friends to sell their positions before we mooned it. \n\nHere\u2019s my take on RKT and GME for the rest of the week. It all depends on the markets reaction to j Powell. The bond and inflation worries have been hurting tech stocks and RKT. My guess is that he will say the same shit as last time...we\u2019re not raising rates. Ok well does the market tank more? I don\u2019t think so. I think will see a sharp decline prior to j Powell then a recovery. That\u2019s my hope. Today\u2019s sell off lacked volume. It was artificial IMO. Hold on to your horses, it could get bloody, but there is always sunshine at the end of the tunnel unless the companies go bankrupt which they won\u2019t. \n\nIf RKT can bounce back above 26 then we\u2019re right back in the game. Again, there really weren\u2019t many sells until panic overcame the paper hands. Just need wales to get their j Powell fix first and stimis should be clearing banks tomorrow too. If the market is slow and not moving then bears have more power. We need to help make it move. \n\nIf the market is slow I would by some calls for longer expirations while they are cheap. That\u2019s the great part of downward volatility - cheap calls. \n\nLet\u2019s finish the week off positively. We\u2019re in this together. Not financial advice I just like the stock and it\u2019s undervalued as shit.",
        "878":"Give me a chance please TLDR; why all of the hate between AMC\/GME? It's not us vs them. It's the average Joe vs the rich\n\nI know I may get banned or laughed at, and this doesn't exactly follow the rules (sorry) but it needs to be said. I have one share of GME that I bought at ~$40 a few weeks ago. I have around 200 shares in amc with about 15 options as well. The thing I don't get is all fo the hate between the two. People saying GME is dead. Or AMC is a distraction. If you truly do your DD you would see neither is dead and neither is a distraction. \n\nAMC is better because it has a cheaper buy in. GME is better because it has a higher target for share price. But none of that matters. Either one of these is sending a message. It's giving the middle finger for 2008. It's calling out the manipulation. It's saying enough is enough. \n\nHating each other causes AMC AND GME to lose. Not one single \"retail investor\" should be hoping the other fails. Because if either AMC or GME wins, the hedgies hurt. If both win\/squeeze, the entire economy\/country and possibly even the world will change. This isn't just about stocks anymore. This could be the  largest (and due to the new DTCC rule, possibly last) transfer of wealth the world has ever seen.\n\n Yes I'm sad I was to late to join GME to begin with, but it isn't done. I'm in AMC now. And if AMC pops first, as soon as it's done I will come support my brothers and sisters in GME 100%. If it pops after, I'll still be rooting. If  AMC doesn't ever pop, I won't be angry at GME. And if GME doesn't pop ill be there to welcome them to AMC. \n\nTo me, this isn't about apes vs apes vs hedgies. This is people that have been put down, oppressed, and she ved to the side, vs people who (for the most part) got lucky, and designed this whole system to keep them up, and us down. \n\nSo support AMC, support GME but most of all support your fellow human who is going thru this as much as you. Who has problems like you do. 6 months ago, all of the shit that is being said about AMC now, was being said about GME. \n\nApe together strong, but more importantly, Common people together, supporting each other, can change the entire world.",

If you want to change that, I recommend you read the free book [here](https:\/\/www.elliottwave.com\/Free-Reports\/Elliott-Wave-Principle). But since I know that most of you are too busy eating crayons I'm going to summarise it quickly.\n\nA rare recording of Ralph Nelson Elliot's early days.\n\nhttps:\/\/reddit.com\/link\/m6mkl8\/video\/vsm22l8l5hn61\/player\n\nAs you can see, our fellow \ud83e\udd8d Ralph already had a real hunger for tendies as a little kid. That hunger drove him to use his crayons on charts until he discovered in the 1930s that the stock market always moves in recognizable patterns back, so-called \"waves\". Simplified there are only two types of waves:\n\n1. Impulse\n2. Corrective\n\n**Impulsive Waves**\n\nThose are always waves that move the market and consist of five sub-waves because five is the smallest number of waves that can accomplish an overall movement.\n\n[ Impulsive Wave on GME Weekly Chart](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/1vuhwi4n5hn61.png?width=535&format=png&auto=webp&s=04cb758cc44e447e13e8362cce604c11bd12085d)\n\n**Corrective Waves**\n\nAlthough there are a few different corrective patterns we can say in general that they consist of three waves because that's the smallest number needed to achieve a retracement.\n\n[ Corrective Wave on GME Daily Chart](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/tz9lls9p5hn61.png?width=382&format=png&auto=webp&s=01894662f90ac0d8e184b0d53749adafc7944245)\n\n*There are a few special cases, and obviously overall more to learn about it, otherwise, there would hardly be an entire book about it.*\n\nBefore we now take our colorful crayons and applied that mind-blowing knowledge on GME there are a few other things you should understand:\n\n1. Each wave can and should contain waves in itself. \ud83e\udd2f I know... Sounds complicated, and often is, but to give you a simple example, in the 1-2-3-4-5 Impulsive wave above, you'd be able - possibly not on the monthly chart but on weekly or lower - to also fit another 1-2-3-4-5 between 2 and 4.This way you can confirm if your patterns are actually valid.\n2. Each 1-2-3-4-5 Impulsive wave is followed by a corrective wave. So, after 1-2-3-4-5, we see a corrective pattern like A-B-C. *(There are a few other corrective patterns but the basic A-B-C zig-zag is most common).*\n\n#  So you are telling me that fellow \ud83e\udd8d Ralph knew how to predict the market almost 100 years ago? Sure...\n\nElliot Waves are highly accurate and in my opinion a great tool to predict what the market or a specific stock is going to do.\n\nUnlike most indicators it doesn't lack behind, however, there are still cases where multiple patterns could be applied and only once a few more candles are on the chart will it be clear which of those actually is correct.\n\nAlready during our first \ud83d\ude80 launch attempt that got canceled by RobinHood and others, I used Elliot Waves to estimate how far that rocket might go.\n\n[Screenshot using Elliot Waves on the GME 15 min chart on the 25th of January](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/11kyqyv46hn61.png?width=1544&format=png&auto=webp&s=1dec899ebec3a26559848da7a73b3e0aff094162)\n\nI shared that screenshot initially [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/l4syrd\/gme_megathread_part_2\/gkqko9z\/) and mentioned in a further reply once we reached that range that a drop in the range of $137-$207 will likely follow before our \ud83d\ude80 finally will launch to more than $4,000 per share.\n\n[What actually happened after that \\\\\"prediction\\\\\"?](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ghttkcd76hn61.png?width=1552&format=png&auto=webp&s=1fd51527a0311b975640fe30d2aa07c4720a3b1b)\n\nAs you can see both statements were highly accurate and IMHO only because of buying restrictions did the drop go further than it should have and our \ud83d\ude80 take-off was canceled.\n\nIf you can follow so far that's great... if not, I really recommend that you use the time while we wait for take-off to read the book about Elliot Waves.\n\n# OK, but how come that $10,000 per share is now just a stop along the way?\n\nWell, by preventing the launch back then HFs fucked up IMHO and now more people are buying tickets for their trip into space.

        "881":"If you still have doubts about the infamous \u201dNaked Shortings\u201d or \u201dhow can a stock have more shares than 100% of the outstanding float?\u201d let me clear that out **TR;LD:** Institutions uses Alternative Trading (ATs) mechanism called Traderbots (HFT, high -frequency trading algos) to insert large positions in the markets using dark pools (hidden positions). Dark pools are private exchange for trading securities that are not available for the investing public, this form of transaction keeps the identity of the parts secret. This process of trading is legal, but it has a loophole where it can be used for fraud and market manipulation. This function allows \u201dnaked shorting\u201d by borrowing shares from someone who owns the shares and duplicating them by putting the synthetic shares back in the market without the duplicate number being noticed, which creates outstanding float discrepancies. Discrepancies on time to deliver shares happens because of settlement periods, these processes are common and part of the market in large. But intentional \u201dnaked shorting\u201d when shares are not available and instead of synthetic shares are released is illegal. \n\n\n\n**How does this happen?**\n\n\nAlternative trading mechanisms (ATs) are algorithm trading bots used by institutions (brokerage -clearing firms, other trading venues, etc.) to process large orders at a lower risk. These transactions are made by HTFs (high-frequency trading) which process large numbers of trades in a manner of milliseconds. \n\nThe reason why ATs were designed is to avoid market volatility, large transactions can induce volatility if they are placed all in once. ATs bots, called Traderbots, distribute the shares in parts as they see fit in the market using dark pools, a hidden process, to limit disruptions on the price by prematurely revealing the positioning of large investors and institutional clients. But the mechanism of dark pools does also presents a potential conflict of interest between trading companies and their affiliates. \n\nAt first, ATs and their regulations were designed to trade shares in form of \u201dblock transactions\u201d around **10k** to **500k** in size, these transactions are charged a lower price fee than the average market pays for because of their size. That is fundamentally why ATs exists, this system is regulated and there is nothing illegal about it. The problem is when institutions use these ATs for manipulating the market. Namely, in the attached article, as \u201d*toxic*\u201d market participant (bad *behavior* by market makers). In a data research, attached in the paper, it was discovered that instead of \u201cblock transactions,\u201d where large amount of trades are made, the number of shares that are regularly exchanged are on average of **181 shares** per transaction.\n\nThere is no transparecency in the way how markets institution and affiliates uses ATs, if they don't get caught it is discretionary to *them* to check the wrongdoing.\n\n_**Here is Barclay\u2019s disclaimer piece**_ from their analysis misuse of dark pools, which they were fined and apologized for:\n\n\u201c*The analysis also determined that the trading venues to which Barclays routed unfilled orders (after first having routed them to its dark pool) tended to be venues hosted by high-speed trading firms, \u201c[n]one of which*,\u201d recalled one Director, \u201c*had a reputation for being favorable to clients from an execution perspective.*\u201d Those venues included Knight Capital, Getco, and Citadel.\n\n*These clients, sited above, is anyone who uses brokerages firms, meaning anyone who trades independently (**YOU**) or not in the market.*\n\n\n_**How these companies uses this leverage and create a toxic market participant behavior?**_\n\na) front-runs transactions, \n\nb)  void regulation, \n\nc)  sell securities short without borrowing (referred to as naked short sales by the SEC), \n\nd) constantly enters orders it intends to cancel for the purpose of spoofing the market, \n\ne) layers trades on top of each other not intending to execute them, but as a means to control the marketplace pricing (price suppression),\n\nf) virtually provide services on demand for its clients regardless of whether they are operating legally or not, what Shitatel provides for HF like Melvin Capital.\n\n*Does that sounds familiar???*\n\nA lot of institutions uses ATs in smaller fractions traded on a millisecond speed-when you see your level ll and \u201dtimes and sales\u201d charts running so fast that you can't track the numbers; that is what we are talking about. Or large body or very long-tailed candles out of context with the overall price action; that is HFT as well. There are many ways how institutions can use this algos to manipulate the market and when they don't have the shares, they borrow from someone else creating a synthetic (fake) share. That is when the number of shares doesn't add to the outstanding float.\n\nThe author of the paper went a step forward saying that \u201dATSs and dark pools are in essence, a *private market*.\u201d\n\nThe idea is that these forms of trading by High-frequency traders such as Traderbot using dark pools, when misused, harm price discovery altering the fundamental functioning of the capital markets. \n\n**How is this becomes illegal?**\n\n\u201dIf dark pool operators route client trades to a cooperating third party and then become the other side to those trades, then dark pools would be acting for their benefit as opposed to protecting their institutional client and providing a fair and efficient market. Moreover, this hypothetical scenario would constitute illegal pre-arranged trading in violation of a number of securities laws. This would clearly be against the public interest, the protection of investors, the maintenance of fair and orderly markets and is contrary to the spirit of Regulation ATS and the anti-fraud provisions of federal law.\u201d\n\nWhen a share is sold by a market maker to an institution, then to the investor by the same Traderbot that operates from the clearhouses to it's affiliates is where transparency lacks and it\u2019s intent can become malicious practices. Where can be short sales not backed by borrowed assets, a.k.a. \u201dnaked shorting\u201d sold for full price and incooporated to the ATs operator\u2019s books (not sent to NSCC\/DTCC for clearance and settlement). Which results in undisclosed securities positions and numbers exceeding the number of shares security has on their total float. Such as we see in GME, AMC and other heavily shorted stocks. It\u2019s one of the techniques that shitty HF uses to hedge themselves in the market.\n\n**Why is important to understand this?**\n\n\nThis process of naked shorting is recurrent in GME. At every \u201dfail to deliver\u201d the shares have have been duplicated to cover the one's prior to it (if I understood correctly). Once there is no available shares to borrow from the limited float of the stock HF are creating more and more counterfeit shares to hedge their positions and keep profiting. While preying on the collapse of the stock. Which they will benefit and leave with millions and millions of dollares. HF tactics is to drive the company into bankruptcy, after all once that happens no one will care to count the shares. HF will take the profits, so it doesn't matter for them to repeat the process until they have active success.\n\nIf you having read it yet, [check this](https:\/\/iamnotafinancialadvisor.com\/discord\/DD\/GMEv10.pdf)  from u\/gafgarian\n\nAs long as prices remain higher, this tactic not only become a major economic risk for HF but it increases the potential of GME short squeeze. Eventually, they have to deliver their shares and get out of the market.

While some short sellers appeared to cover their bearish bets in recent weeks, a short-selling expert says he still sees plenty of squeeze potential.\n\nShares were down 19% to $178.12 around 10:30 a.m. Such levels are still many multiples higher than the stock\u2019s one-year low of $2.57.\n\nIhor Dusaniwsky, managing director at short-selling analytics firm S3 Partners, told Barron\u2019s on Monday that his firm estimates about 8.98 million GameStop shares (ticker: GME) were recently sold short, about 16% of shares available for trading.\n\nDusaniwsky said over the last month, his firm has seen about 7.5 million shorts covered, meaning bearish investors bought shares to cover their bets. The bulk came over the past week, when 4.6 million shares were covered.\n\n\u201cGME shorts are going through a short squeeze, and the stock continues to be on of the top stocks in our short squeeze potential metric, which means the squeeze is probably going to continue if its stock price remains at these levels or higher,\u201d Dusaniwsky added.\n\nThe company\u2019s shares rocketed higher last week following a company announcement that Chewy co-founder Ryan Cohen has been chairing a board committee aimed at transforming the retailer into a technology business. Cohen joined the board with two associates in January, kicking off GameStop\u2019s parabolic ascent.\nGameStop said it will report fiscal fourth-quarter results on March 23. Analysts expect adjusted earnings of $1.35 a share, up from $1.27 a share in the prior fiscal fourth quarter, according to FactSet. Of course, analysts are far more bearish on GameStop than the retail investors posting on Reddit\u2019s WallStreetBest forum. The highest price target listed by FactSet is $33, while the mean target is $14.64.\n\nI would also like to receive updates and special offers from Dow Jones and affiliates. I can While near-term results could cool off the GameStop rally, those excited about the stock are looking far into the future. If the company provides upbeat color on its e-commerce efforts and the impact of the new gaming consoles, it could make a quarterly miss more palatable.",
        "885":"GME, has anyone considered this possibility...Cohen ace in the hole? So Ryan Cohen originally purchased his 12.9% stake in Gamestop at $8.43 per share average.  Based on the current price, this is about a 2300% profit.  \n\nPer his contract as a board member, he cannot own more than 20% of the company, leaving him with 7.1% company stake remaining he is able to purchase, or roughly 3,900,000 shares.\n\nSo let's say he sits and waits till this Friday, when MMs continue to move the price toward 155 (current calculated max pain price for options on 3\/19).  He then files a 13F, and buy's up 3.9 million shares...this would still put his profit average well over 1000%, AND would blow MM's attempts to pin the price out of the water, triggering a gamma squeeze...this creates massive margin calls by Tuesday 3\/23, which coincidentally happens to be when GME reports earnings.  The convergence of these two factors in addition to hype momentum ***could be enough*** to then trigger the MOASS imo.  Thoughts?\n\nNot financial advice, I like the stock.",

I was asked to write up the recent relation between ETF's and the GME dip's we've been witnessing in the last several trading days.* ***I have included a TLDR for the crayon eating apes with an attention span of a 2-month-old dog. Also due to wsb guidelines, i am unable to mention these etf tickers due to their market cap. Please bear with me (not the \ud83d\udc3b\ud83c\udf08)***\n\nAnyone questions? Feel free to DM and I'll respond in 10-15 working days (jk)\n\nHedge Funds covering up $GME shorts through ETF cloaking\n\n*I would like to present a few common terminologies before starting this post which may aid in helping you apes comprehend this more clearly.*\n\n**Exchange-Traded Funds (ETF)-** An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a type of security that tracks an index, sector, commodity, or another asset, but which can be purchased or sold on a stock exchange the same as a regular stock. An ETF can be structured to track anything from the price of an individual commodity to a large and diverse collection of securities. ETFs can even be structured to track specific investment strategies. You can consider them as a hybrid of mutual funds.\n\n**Short Selling-** Short selling is the process of selling shares that you don't own, but have instead borrowed, likely from a brokerage. Most people short sell shares for two reasons:\n\n1. They expect the share price to decline. Short-sellers hope to sell shares at a high price today and use the proceeds to buy back the borrowed shares at a lower price sometime in the future in a bid to profit.\n2. They want to hedge or offset a position held in another security. For example, if you have sold a [put option](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/p\/put.asp), an offsetting position would be to short sell the underlying security.\n\n**Authorized Participants -** An authorized participant is an organization that has the right to create and redeem shares of an exchange-traded fund (ETF). They provide a large portion of the liquidity in the ETF market by obtaining the underlying assets required to create the shares of an ETF. When there is a shortage of ETF shares in the market, authorized participants create more. Likewise, as ETF borrow costs increase, APs are less likely to borrow shares to hedge their position, and more likely to fail-to-deliver.\n\nIn a typical transaction, the borrower of a stock posts collateral of 102% to 105% of the shares' value in cash, government securities or a bank letter of credit. If the ETF needs to sell the stock, it can recall it from the borrower. But if the borrower for any reason isn't able to deliver the shares, the ETF is repaid through the collateral instead, although that can have adverse tax consequences for the ETF.\n\n**$GME relationship: Let's look at the past trend of an ETF with GME**\n\nNow I'm not claiming today's red day was entirely due to etf's being shorted or their shares being lent out, but there is significant evidence that leads me to believe this may be one of the key factors.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Notice how the assets plummet suddenly after the first short squeeze?](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ge6epulq4bn61.png?width=688&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b84a08585e0d2b57f4cab485d2ae0b466c42605)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*By law, a fund can have no more than one-third of its total assets in securities on loan. Few ETFs or other funds ever reach that ceiling, and ETFs are considered to be more conservative lenders than other funds. Market makers are continually creating new ETF shares (by presenting the fund with a basket of securities represented in the ETF) and redeeming others (and getting the underlying securities in return), so the number of ETF shares outstanding fluctuates. Because the supply isn't fixed, there really is no impact on performance when an ETF is net short, industry participants say. The prices of ETF shares typically stay very close to the value of the underlying holdings.*\n\n***ETF shares borrowed today saw significant lending. Suspicious, isn't it?***\n\nCredit to [u\/hkzor](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/u\/hkzor\/) for providing these images:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ETF 1: 6.5M available last week to 4M today](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/0vkjixsk4bn61.png?width=387&format=png&auto=webp&s=4160a26d935c7e32ceb0947872a9be36b42417b1)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ETF 2: 1.3M available last week to 850k today](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/upqsjgpl4bn61.png?width=388&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c94b5ed3dd2b2426dacbcd5a9564bd226dc48e8)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ETF 3: 900k last week to 500k today](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/fxca18jm4bn61.png?width=434&format=png&auto=webp&s=9052e6bba2197671977783472dde2f9e14388f9f)\n\nJust taking into account **Three** ETF lendings, **you could see 3.35 Million shares were borrowed in today's trading session.**\n\nShort Sellers effectively manipulate pricing by borrowing shares in a company in order to sell them with downward pressure, coupling it with High-Frequency Machines being used, the price of a security can significantly drop in a rapid succession as we've been witnessing for the past few trading days.\n\n**The HF's have most likely synthetically shorted GME via ETF's to drive its price down since then**. They can also legally disguise their short position via synthetic longs, and there's concrete evidence that they have done this on the various articles posted before.\n\n**When coupled with synthetic longs via options, gives the appearance of shorts covering when they haven't, takes GME off the threshold security list when it shouldn't be**, and provides the ability to naked short GME again. This was the missing piece of how GME could actually be shorted without appearing so. This solves the NYSE threshold securities issue and the ability to drive GME down outside of buying a put.\n\n**Ultimately they have to cover these shorts sometime or another, if the ETF's recall their shares back that would mean an absolute fuckery of melvin and citadel, given they are still paying massive SI without the numbers actually showing up the threshold index**.\n\nThe Link Between Failure to Delivers and ETF's\n\nETF's are a growing force in financial markets and constitute almost 25% of US equity trading volume, therefore please keep in mind that not all shares shorted with specific ETF's are directly linked to GME. The one's I used as evidence is either because $GME is a major part of their portfolio or the ETF is retail orientated.\n\n**Failure To Deliver -** A condition where two investors agree to the purchase\/sale of a security at a given price but the seller fails to deliver the security in a timely manner.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The daily volume of Failure to deliver traded in the past](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/h7263a5f4bn61.png?width=588&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7576c75223e5ddf8959093fafaea48d12586046)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ETF's being shorted in the past](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/kw9k81jg4bn61.png?width=801&format=png&auto=webp&s=976a2e44cdd6327ed13ee81021e913ae02c6ad0f)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nComparing both charts depict how the recent increase in Failure to deliver has had a direct correlation with ETF volume being shorted. Point being? The finance industry has used ETF's as a way of covering up their Failure to deliver's way before $GME. \n\n**Authorized Participant Arbitrage Option: Operational Shorting**\n\nWhen faced with \"excessive buying\" pressure as we have witnessed with $GME, Authorized Participants and Market may sell shares as \"Naked\" and then locate or create the shares at a later time (up to T+6 for bona fide market making). However, delaying past T+3 results in a failure to deliver **but AP\/Market Makers are allowed to fail past T+3 because they are \"making markets\" and have an additional three days to settle trades (a total of T+6). This choice of shorting can also lock in a profit if options are used to hedge their exposure but with less capital outlay.** I won't go too in-depth about options hedging in this post because I want to keep the topic on the point of ETF's. However, I see a lot of misconception regarding calls and delta hedging which leads to misinformation being spread.\n\n**TLDR**\n\n**Do NOT WORRY about the price decreasing, this is all synthetically created to kick down the eventual outcome down the road through lending ETF shares and recent data proves that**. **Over 3.5 million shares were lent out through etf's yesterday and their failure to deliver's are accumulating each and every day. It's like maxing your credit card to pay off the debt on your other credit card. Does it solve the issue? No. It only delays it and makes it worse.

        "891":"Option activity GME Puts: Open Interest over Volume So I was surfing the 3\/19 option chain for GME Friday mid-day when 3\/12's were about to expire and noticed some sizable volume well over open interest in the 195 and 200 puts.  (I later saw some lesser volume higher at 230 put strike.)  Obviously were some new contracts getting written at the 195 level.\n\n[3\\\/12\\\/2021 about mid day in 3\\\/19 contracts \\(Open Int. far right, Volume 2nd from right\\)](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/cqwutaavkan61.jpg?width=1369&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=66b2dc9bef6439fcf5cddba083bcde66065402f7)\n\nSo I Youtubed bearish put straddles Friday night and mused the aim was to write the contracts for the funding to push the price down to the 230 range the next week.  Not to the levels of the price on the contracts of 195-200.\n\nSo I wasn't appalled this morning on coffee break when I saw the big drop.  Here's a snapshot of the option prices after the drop.  Think they made a killing on the option? Nope!  Delta ate into the price since 3\/19 contracts are now prime time for the buzzer Friday 4pm.\n\n[3\\\/15\\\/2021 \\(3\\\/19 contract chain\\) post drop 10:30 CDT ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/grzf93o5oan61.jpg?width=1369&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c880d10abebcd74199ab0f029bc32e6bf975a276)\n\nThe drop gained some cred and psych for the put peddlers.  Looks like more volume at the 200 strike.  See the open interest much higher as a result of the Friday put writing at 195-200. \n\nAt the close I snapshotted and highlighted some observations.\n\n[3\\\/15\\\/2021 close \\(3\\\/19 GME chain\\)](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/miiufbvkpan61.jpg?width=1380&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cdddaffe1c968aa9e1d8bdb84e4c8b2d69bad1b1)\n\nLooks like a lot of the big volume was in and out of other strikes, but the action is 2 to 3 times higher than open interest in the (Out-of-the-Money) OTM Puts (ovaled in green).  Still, the price of the 200 put (in red) is at the Friday prices, for now, due to the ticking expiration or Delta. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR\n\nLace up Diamond Hands.

        "894":"GME Trading Strategy to Catalyze the Squeeze I made a comment yesterday on a post that did some technical analysis on GME, and several people asked that I turn that comment into a post, so here it is.\n\nObviously I'm going to start by saying all of this is based on my opinion of what needs to happen to spark the squeeze.\n\n**First, the comment as it was:**\n\n*I've seen lots of bullish TA on GME. Keep in mind, ALL TA requires volume to play out how it should. We haven't had any volume on GME in over a week.\n\nHolding shares simply isn't enough - needs constant (all day every single day) buying of shares and IN THE MONEY options.\n\nIf you buy options that are 20-30% in the money they literally can't price pin because they can't get and keep the price 20-30% below current market. So you force immediate share buying by market makers to hedge, and virtually eliminate their means of counter-attack which has been price pinning at the point of maximum pain (price at which most contracts expire worthless).\n\nIf you are intending to help push the squeeze, buy shares throughout the day every day. If you are playing options, mostly buy calls in the money. If you're buying OTM calls, buy as close to current price as you can afford. The more imbalanced OTM calls are, the more they're just going to price pin at maximum pain. They literally cannot do this if there is a ridiculous amount of new ITM call interest that they have to buy shares to hedge.*\n\nEssentially, we cannot rely on normal technical indicators for movement with Gamestop. There are two major reasons. \n\n1. Manipulation. We cannot do anything about this really, aside from buy and hold. Technicals actually have a tendencies to work in reverse when a stock is being manipulated at these levels. The shorts, while stuck in a stupid position, aren't stupid. They know when the TA is indicating a bullish setup, and that is the best time for them to attack the stock to break the setup.\n\n2. Volume. All technical setups require volume to play out. If volume doesn't follow, the technical setup fails and the price action is unpredictable. Except in this case, it goes down because it's being shorted at every chance.\n\nSo what do we need to do? Hold? Yes. But that can't be it. If we are doing nothing but holding, this will be a stalemate that they will probably win as sections of retail gets bored or impatient. They can literally hold us in a stalemate for months\/years if volume never shows up to move the price. *Yes, they pay more interest the longer they have to wait. They'll just manipulate other sectors of the market to force gains and cover their losses unless the SEC steps in to stop market manipulation.* \n\n#Volume\n\nWithout volume, there is no endgame. Look at every day we've had spikes. Look at the volume. Now look at the past week or two. We aren't making progress because nobody is buying shares, aside from some whale algos that are simply fighting off the short attacks. Believe it or not, the whales do need retail support to force the squeeze. The whales are the ones creating momentum from time to time. If it catches on, they can follow it up. But if they just go all out to create a surge and nobody follows behind them to buy, they are literally risking billions of dollars to fail.\n\nThis thing will likely happen in waves over the course of a few days. If you look at any day, there are surges in buy volume, but they're short. That's likely a whale, testing the market. If they see confirmation\/follow-up from the market, it's less risky for them to send a second wave of buying pressure. So it will be something like, whale buy, retail confirmation buys, whale buy, runaway effect, gamma squeeze and then finally short squeeze. All of those things have to happen consecutively, fluidly and fairly quickly to beat any kind of counter attack.\n\nNow this is going to sound counterintuitive, but in order to catalyze the squeeze, we have to stop just buying the dip. When volume picks up and the price is spiking, that's the most important time to buy. That's the point when additional buying pressure is most important. And until the retail market confirms pressure on one of those spikes, we are going to keep bouncing back and forth.\n\n#Options\n\nThe other side of the coin is options purchases. **Stop devoting the majority of your capital to far OTM lotto tickets.** This helps the short positions, because it forces the market makers to help the shorts. Market makers that sell call options have to hedge their risk. When you buy an $800c, it does two things.\n\n1. They don't have to buy very many shares up front to remain risk neutral.\n\n2. In incentivizes the market makers to pin the price.\n\nYou can do some additional reading on max pain price in options, but it is essentially the closing price at which the largest number of options expire worthless. When you buy OTM call options, you're increasing the maximum pain price, which makes it easier for market makers (and shorts) to pin the price there.\n\nIf, however, you're buying a ton of ITM call options, you're doing two things:\n\n1. Deep ITM calls have a delta of essentially 1.00. This means that in order to remain risk neutral, the market makers essentially has to buy 100 shares immediately upon selling you the contract.\n\n2. It lowers the max pain price by creating an imbalance towards lower strikes having the most OI. This means in order to pin the price at max pain, they would need to drop it from it's current price.\n\nNot only do you force market makers to be risk neutral immediately (meaning they don't care where the price goes), you also force them to immediately put buying pressure on the stock price.\n\nIf you must buy OTM calls, buy ones that are at least closer to being ITM. The further OTM you buy calls, the more likely the price will go sideways. You can also sell calls and roll them into higher prices to remain leveraged as the price increases. Once it achieves a runaway squeeze, which will be easy to identify, you can start buying your lotto tickets.\n\nTl;dr: In my opinion, if you want to help catalyze the squeeze, you need to buy shares when the price is spiking and buy calls that are at least 10-20% in the money.\n\n\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf16",

So let me end this retardness\n\nYes, I joined Reddit 41 days ago. The same day Mark Cuban came here to chat with us. I like some apes here bought GME in January out of fomo. I saw the stock go up and then crash down to the 50s. I\u2019m usually a low risk stock trader, but I saw an opportunity to \u201cget rich quick.\u201d When I saw my portfolio go red for the first time ever, I was panicking, like wtf is going on. I knew RH and other brokerages restricted us from buying which led to the dip, so I HELD. So when I saw Mark Cuban on here and he told us to \u201cHOLD!\u201d I felt reassured. Since I created a new account and joined wsb, I thought to browse through all the post and memes. Here I saw stories of how people were effected in 2008, and their parents lost their homes due to these 1%. I saw stories of how people have been poor or barely making ends meet have this once in a lifetime opportunity to turn their life around. I\u2019ve seen stories about expensive medical bills, rent, buying a first home, and other necessities, how this opportunity can change their lives. I seen stories about just wanting to get their tendies so apes can buy a lambo. All these stories really touched me and changed my whole perspective about life, stocks and this short squeeze. I originally bought these stocks for the money, but now I know it\u2019s much much more. It\u2019s NOT about ME, it\u2019s about \ud83e\udd8d. APES STRONG TOGETHER! And anyone else who doesn\u2019t agree with this movement and only cares about their money, you\u2019re just a selfish paper hand to me. So the past month and a half, I took the time to learn, learn about stocks, options, shorts, GME, etc... because I believe in this stock and I was to help others. I know firsthand how it feels to be a newbie and buying due to fomo and seeing the stock dip. So I\u2019m trying to help and educate the fellow apes as much as I can, because every ape is important no matter how many shares they hold, because there\u2019s more than one way to help the cause than buying.\n\nSo some of y\u2019all can continue to criticize me, I really don\u2019t care. I\u2019m going to continue to help and educate others.\n\nFinally if that story isn\u2019t convincing, IF GME CLOSES AT LEAST $350 on FRIDAY, I will eat a Green Crayon. \n\nHopefully that convinces the naysayers that I\u2019m a \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83e\udd8d!",

        "900":"Sup, apetards! I've been DOING some technical ANALysis recently (fractals and shit), and found out that GeeMEeee is going to fking PENETRATE $1K next week. Hope you enjoy the read! Yeah, you heard it right, and you most likely know that already, but lemme give you some technical rationale of how this might happen. The analysis is build upon fractal techniques, so that the previous price action is used for making this forecast. Buckle up and eat a Crayon, fellow trader (the word is used as anagram you know for what) as it will help you stay nutrated for the rest of this reading, and it might even help you with the digestion (of the information in the post).\n\nThis is not a financial advice and I am not and a professional advisor, I just enjoy to share my knowledge and educate brainless apes occasionally.\n\n\"BuT whY dO I neEd your FARTCAL ANALizis?!1\"\n\nWell, that's a good question. When I was a young ape living free in the Steppes of Kazakhstan... JK, leave poor Vlad alone for a moment. **The fractal** (from Latin *fractus*) means a steady scalable design of irregular shape emerging on any data. The trade fractal in the financial market is the pattern, formed by a sequence(es) of candles, which has peculiar identifiable characteristics and a tendency to reoccur across different scales and time-frames. Fractals are simple yet important, repetitive formations used by traders to identify and to confirm a trend. Apely speaking, fartcals allow us to forecast the future price action based on the previous similar trends on a given trading instrument.\n\nNow that the captain is gone, let's get to business.\n\n[GME fartcals wroom wroom](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/yge17n3k12n61.png?width=2160&format=png&auto=webp&s=d533ec1fdbcf6443b2233142f87bb285f0c27786)\n\nI know that you all love Crayons with all of your hearts, so I will use rare turquoise and magenta ones in this analysis. Furthermore, I did my best to simplify the method of distinguishing the fractal sequences, using simple lines, and hopefully you should need no more than one brain wrinkle to understand it.  \nWhat you see on the chart (one candle represents 2 hours of price action) above is a perfect example of beautiful fractals. The chart starts from the 11th of January with the turquoise slightly downward tilted consolidation. Next you see a relatively soft magenta upward impulse (14-16 Jan), followed by another turquoise consolidation, this time slightly tilting up and lasting for about three days. Next is where the things really start to get interesting (22nd Jan), as the subsequent magenta upward impulse accelerates exponentially. This accelerection does not go quietly, erupting into a powerful gap (not as big as the one in your head, though). Finally, starting 27th of Jan we have a local endgame highlighted by a purple rectangle with the apex (pay attention to this peak, as it will be used for calculations later) on the 27th of January. 'What? Why purple rectangle?' you may ask. Easy. REKTangles are the Horsemen of the Endgame.  \nThat was only the left part of the chart. Now let's be brief for a moment. There were six main components to the fractal base: turquoise consolidation, magenta uptrend, turquoise consolidation 2, magenta impulse, gap and purple rectangle. What you see on the right, is the original base for the fractal described above meets its bigger brother. Particularly, starting 22nd Feb a very similar chain of price actions manifests. And this is how we really utilize fractals: identify the fractal sequence from the previous data (on the left), and after that apply the pattern to similar market conditions (on the right). Many of the the things look really similar on both sides of the graph, don't they? Coincidence? I think not.  \n\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/v5s6clts12n61.jpg?width=534&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f7e6dcacd9509becc15e1e38a254575986e49063\n\n\"Oh fArtcaLs good Butt WEN MOON?1!\"  \n\n\n[Here you go boy](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/f0u97sfv12n61.jpg?width=461&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d64f1f93399d094112b49cf4170475e56ce84bc8)\n\n  \nAllrighty. I know that the energy from the Crayon you ate is running out, so lemme summarize the analysis for this intellectually limited individual with extraordinary small brain capacity that you are. What I need you to do now is what even a half brained chimpanzee is capable of. Count to six (yes, you may use your fingers). Twice.\n\n[Numbers and fractals simplified for dummies](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/mfnkdif022n61.png?width=2160&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d2fd1b92e9a7bf6c2bbeb0fac0ed538ea35d96b)\n\n1 = flat line;  \n2 = small magenta hill;  \n3 = line as flat as your wife's girlfriend's tit;  \n4 = accelerection;  \n5 = your brain (aka Gap);  \n6 = Valhala REKTangle \/ GME go BBBBRRRRRRR  \n\n\nGood boy\/girl, you've come this far. Now that your confirmation bias is reinforced, you may get some rest. Or eat another nutritious crayon my brain destitute ape friend, because we are DIVING DEEPER.\n\nOk, it turned out that I needed to eat some Crayons myself, because I really got exhausted writing the post for five hours in a row. So I ate a pack this time, and I am full of GMEnergy. As is the chart below, so bullish, that we will definitely see some GMEnergy explosions in a short time to come. Now the complexity of analysis is going to increase a little bit, but the apes have to evolve at one point in history, so I really encourage you to use this opportunity.   \n\n\n[In-depth fractal forecast](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/888zsh3c22n61.png?width=2160&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec2c553761a27dc98efa7dae3de918da0d4f600f)\n\nI hope that you got accustomed to the previous six steps for dummies explanation, and by this moment you should understand the basic principle of how the fractals play. What you see above is a little bit more advanced chart, through which I aim to explain how I came to the price predictions in the post title (finally!). Ok, 1 2 3 4 5 6 is understandable, where did A B come from? The first and most important notice, is that A-B fractals are built upon 1-2-3-4-5-6, and on the chart you can see that A measures 1-2-3-4 pattern, while B covers 5-6 steps of the sequence. A-B on the left (January run) is self explanatory, the fractals are measured as they are. A-B on the right (current price action formation) is where we need some math to get involved, particularly, when we are working with the new B movement prediction. And that is not as difficult as it may seem from a first glance. Again, the main fractal property, re-occurrence, will play on our side. Predicting the price movements, on a volatile market like this one, is one of the most ungrateful things to do, so don't go too harsh on what I am going share with you, apesters. My theory, is that it is possible to predict the amplitude of the upcoming move, using data from previous one. And here, we only need the coefficient from first A-B move. A simple ratio: dividing first B move (about $325 increase) by first A move ($131) gives us a coefficient of about 2,48. Let's apply this ratio to the currently forming fractal: that is multiplying the second A fractal completed height (about $330 based on my prediction, which is built later in this post), which will give the estimated B part of the second fractal height of about $818, landing us on the sweet $1200 dollar level through the next week. Boom, looks beautiful and promising! Fractals, baby!  \n\n\nI hope it has been an entertaining as well as mentally developing read for you so far, smoothie-brainie. But there is still one important part of the analysis left to be addressed. Particularly, it is the the sequence part number 4, where the price action stands currently. And yeah, you guessed it, almighty fractals are helping us here again. Below you will find two charts (both are 30 min charts), which are actually zoomed in the price actions of the fourth step of the two fractals analyzed above. I can't stop enjoying and appreciating fractals and below you should really see why.  \n\n\n[GME price action 22-27 January](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/heozo1gg22n61.png?width=1646&format=png&auto=webp&s=d637c1806d229ffad089dc6491357ce01b55207a)\n\n[GME price action 5-15 March](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/m1dydccm22n61.png?width=1646&format=png&auto=webp&s=9724902e12d23390a6f614fe026acd4f2c4abf3d)\n\nBecause they look similar again! Now I will ask you to excuse me, I started to work on this analysis about ten hours ago, and I really need to get some sleep, as my brain is holding strong to the last wrinkle it has left, so this explanation will be brief. I forecasted the apex point of the current 4 using not so complicated method, and again taking inspiration from the previous price action and its underlying patterns. The magenta curly lines play as supports for both of the impulses. And these look amazingly similar in its slope and pace, but we should probably stop being surprised about that at this point. The second important fractal factor is this chainsaw in the middle of the patterns, corresponding to the severe corrections in these bull runs. Remember being in the market at those moments? Wooh, that was fun. And finally, take a look at this averaged line that looks like a string of a bow - not only it averages the price action, it also completes this bow shaped fractal pattern, allowing us to predict the potential high of the current price action ($380-ish). That's it folks, mic drop.\n\nTL;DR: Fractals is life fractals is love  \u2764\ufe0f  as is GEEEMEEE",

Lets take a look at this:\n\nA graph of apple users versus apple price from robinhood's API in 2020, going up to 8\/6\/2020. They stopped offering this information via API at this date.  We can ignore apple price here, we're looking just at ownership.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Source: Robintrack.net](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/1xji566rn1n61.png?width=1633&format=png&auto=webp&s=202fbbb95234ba5a1a6ae13453c992879805b25e)\n\nThe above shows on 8\/6, 730k RH users owned Apple. That's 5.6% of users at the time using their 13m users number, which the total user number I would speculate is a bit lower at that time, as they grew from 10 to 13m users in 2020. RH stopped their API showing this info, so 8\/6 is the most recent you can get on any company.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGME was the most popular stock on RH, so I find it reasonable to believe at least 5% owned it, most likely WAY WAY more considering the global exposure this got. Once again, RH average account size is $5k. Please do the math here of how Jan may have looked. **This is ONLY on Robinhood**. Of course this is speculation here, but I feel that it's pretty reasonable. It's speculation based on prior data. & if users really are 23m, that's even crazier. Here's math below about what GME could have looked like. This is based on 13m users. Then, **add all of the other brokers**. This chart is only robinhood. You get the idea. Realistically, *other* brokers ownership percentage probably isn't *as* high, but it's still going to be way up there, especially during the GME phenomenon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|If average # of shares per person is|% of RH users that owned the most popular stock|Total shares owned on RH|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|5|730k shares|\n|1|10|1.46m shares|\n|5|5|3.65m shares|\n|5|10|7.3m shares|\n|10|5|7.3m shares|\n|10|10|14.6m shares|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyways, moving back to the more broad discussion and no longer focusing on GME.\n\n\"The **total market capitalization** of the **U.S. stock market** is $50,808,508.7 million(over complicated way of saying $50.8T (12\/31\/2020)\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Source: https:\\\/\\\/www.nasdaq.com\\\/articles\\\/who-counts-as-a-retail-investor-2020-12-17](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ludljsdtn1n61.png?width=1003&format=png&auto=webp&s=1cd3e4113641f443d002de2dde95913532440a47)\n\nIt appears our estimates line up pretty closely with other data. *Notice how mutual funds are SEPERATE here.*\n\nSo why does retail \"not control the market\" ?\n\nPersonally, I disagree with this statement. Retail does control the market. **Then why is there a narrative that retail doesn't control the market?** Two main reasons in my opinion. Yes, this is speculation based on data. Form your own conclusions. Here's insight into mine.\n\n1. Retail isn't coordinated. Even though we collectively own over 1\/3 of the market, we can't coordinate things like the elite can. We can't dump 1 million shares all at the exact same time to tank a stock price. We can't control the media narrative because we don't own\/aren't in bed with the media, so we lose some influence here. Retail doesn't control the day to day action on a stock, but retail controls it from a broader sense. *One raindrop cannot cause a flood, but continuous raindrops over an extended period of time do*.\n2. Information **IS** becoming a commodity, there's just so much shit and misinformation to sift through right now, it's difficult for most people. Retail gains more and more control every day through decentralization and increased freedom of information on the internet. *They ARE terrified of retail*. The potential for \"power\" to shift back to the people out of the elites hands is higher than ever with the advancements of tech. I could write a whole paper on this concept. I believe decentralization is the future for everything. Information, politics, money, stocks, etc. It is imperative for the elite to keep this knowledge away from the people. Knowledge is power. Poverty and education are linked significantly. Keeping people in the dark and unaware of their capabilities is an extremely powerful tool that has been used to suppress people since civilization began.\n\nI know above points might sound a little bit over the top, but these are my opinions based on data. I'd be happy to engage in talks around any of these points. There may be data that is just plain wrong, or that I misinterpreted.

        "903":"Melvin, Citadel, and Point 72 (GME) I\u2019m long on GME and enjoying this crazy ride with all of you fellow \ud83e\udd8d. Thank you to everyone on this community and especially those who have done some incredible DD over the last couple months. This has been one hell of a roller coaster ride. I\u2019m proud of you \ud83d\udc8e hands that held through Wednesday. \n\nI believe in both the gamma and short squeeze. The recovery from last Wednesday and to be holding this price integrity with such low volume in the last couple trading days has been encouraging. I obviously would have liked to see more of a bump on Friday 3\/12 to trigger the heavily bought expiring 300 call options. \n\nIn reviewing all the DD, I\u2019m really only questioning two things, of which only one can be answered. \n\n1. I\u2019ve seen a lot of calcs on the actual number of naked short shares needed to cover. IMO - These numbers vary significantly and with the resources available is probably only conjecture and to be seen upon the conclusion of this squeeze.\n\n2. MY MAIN QUESTION (AND REASON FOR THIS POST). We know Melvin was down 53% in January due to the first GME squeeze. They testified before congress these shares were covered. Citadel and Point 72 since have invested $3 billion in Melvin with an agreement for future revenue sharing. Why would they open themselves up to this type of capital exposure to a firm who\u2019s teetering on the brink of bankruptcy? Especially if the intent was to double down and short GME again to recover these losses. Wouldn\u2019t Citadel and Point 72 been better off letting Melvin fail and taking their own capital and shorting GME? I know the CEO of Melvin used to work for Citadel, but I just struggle with this ideology. Furthermore the SI (short interest) in GME has fallen by 50% since the first squeeze in January (correct me with exact numbers).\n\nAgain, I\u2019m long on GME and not trying to be a FUD... But if anyone has thoughts on how these hedgies operate, please enlighten my poor ape intellect!\n\nSee y\u2019all on the moon! I\u2019ll be the guy in the mullet handing out wife beaters.\n\n\ud83e\udd8d RR",

Personally, I have a very specific goal in mind with $GME. I am in at 22 shares at about $222. I stand by this movement, for many reasons, and for those who bite that potential loss in the name of change I honestly salute you.\n\nBut the nature of the market is there will always be bag holders. I accepted this risk, you accepted this risk. In the coming weeks, please take DD with a grain of salt and do not let people influence your own plan of just instinct. I let myself get cooerced into buying it at around 340 a share like the degenerate I am; I lowered the average because I personally believe in the company long term, squeezes aside. But this decision cost me a lot. While I could cash out this very moment for profit, had I waited even a week, like I wanted to initially, I would have gotten in at not even half that lol. If you are in this for the squeeze, keep that goal in mind and don't let paper hand jokes and peer pressure make you commit horrible decisions with your finances. At the end of the day, a million people may cheer you into bankruptcy but I doubt a single one will stand by to lift you out of it. Regardless of $GME, $AMC, meme stock or a fucking boomer stock, you need to put yourself first above everything else. My girlfriend gave me excellent advice the other day I wanted to share with you all; treat this like an airplane crashing. Put your own mask on before you think of anyone else's. If you gotta stomp people like me down to make it out okay, do it without remorse. That's free market at work, honestly. We all take a risk for a big pay and we all can bounce back if this pays off. But please keep in mind a lot of people on here posting massive loss porn have safety nets in place;  Roth IRAs, good jobs, other plays to hedge losses, etc. Don't presume you can be a consistent retard YOLOing your life savings and walk away from it. I am turning 25 on the 23rd (Daddy Cohen is gifting me an earnings report \u263a) and even just 5k is a huge play on my part. Be smarter than me; be an autist.\n\nGod speed, retards.\n\nP.S.

Sellers OVERWHELMED buyers and the price tanked $140.\n\nAsk yourself for a moment why a holder of stock would ever want to get the least amount of money for it? If you wanted to sell stock you would sell it gradually so as to not 'spook' the market. You would want the price to remain strong while you un-wind your position.\n\nThere is only one explanation for what happened: a massively co-ordinated short interest attack to inspire fear and simulate a Bank Run (when the average investor loses confidence in the Church of GME and fears the price is in free fall).\n\nThey're trying to create a positive feed-back loop of fear where eventually YOU sell your shares.\n\nThis strategy of 'dumping' massive amounts of shares is, as everyone knows, VERY COMMON. It's why you see the after-market tank. It's why you see the pre-market tank. It's why you see an EARNINGS BEAT and then the shares DIVE OFF A CLIFF. It's shorts trying to inspire a panic.\n\nWhat's very interesting about this short attack was that it was obviously massively coordinated. There are MANY shorts in GME and they are all acting, to some degree, independent based on their cost-basis and level of exposure. Some shorts may actually be switching their positions to go long.\n\n[In my post here I explain why GME could be legitimately valued at $500 a share.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/m35u61\/memeageddon_judgement_day_witching_day_march_19th\/)\n\nThis attack on March 10th reveals that there is a MASSIVE WHALE that is cornered and willing to dump billions to get out. It's absolute confirmation that someone does not want to have to buy-back shares at these prices.\n\nIf you are up against the wall, as a HF, and either lose billions or make billions, you are juts going to keep doubling down.

This may co-incide with a Short Attack to make it look like people are cashing in.\n\n**Important price 6: $483 - THE ALL TIME HIGH**\n\nAs the all time high is approached many 'smart retards' will think to sell before other people start selling. Everyone is seeing that goal line and it may create more selling pressure as we reach that peak. There will also be less retail buying at these levels since who wants to buy at the peak. The only buyers will be the shorts covering which would just keep pushing the price up IF they get called and or are covering.\n\n\\*\\*TLDR:\\*\\*There are at least 6 important price milestones at which shorts may attack next week and DUMP a lot of shares for sale in a short period of time.

        "911":"There are more retail investors than ever, but we don\u2019t have the power to tank markets. I saw a post of a person nervous that the economy is going to tank because of GameStop. This individual\u2019s mind was so manipulated by the media that she truly thinks retail investors are the reason for GameStop and the possibility of a recession. The post was insulting against the common people, and it was extremely na\u00efve. We can help the cause, but as you saw today and yesterday we certainly cannot move it or else we would have. All we do is help bullish institutions by HodLing a stock that we like. \n\nI also see a lot of articles saying that retail investors are essentially the cause of hedge funds losing money and 401(k) stocks just doing their average thing. Meanwhile we\u2019re making 100%-300% returns because we see past the bullshit and don\u2019t trust the system. This is infuriating to me and I don\u2019t think it gets a enough of attention. Gme dropped from 348 to 178 before I could take a snapshot of my gains...yeah we don\u2019t have that type of power. We have a different power...buy and hold a stock we like. \n\nThere are some really smart apes on WSB here and some really dumb apes. We don\u2019t have the ability to pum* GME, we just make it A LOT harder for you to dum* it. The reason for that is because we are fearless and re*arded and we like the stock. We have learned not to panic sell (more of us at least).\n\nMy point is figure it the fuck out and stop patronizing over 9 million people by telling the public that we are some godly entity with extreme power. If you\u2019re out there hedgies please listen: figure out your own problems that your own greed got you into and stop crying on live television. The only difference between retails then and now, is that we see right past your lies and are more aware of how to make money. We just do it legally. \n\nThree years ago no one thought a retail investor could be, not a force in the market, but a CHANGE in the market. What really grinds my bananas, is the fact that it is the billionaire hedge funds job to adjust and pivot to the macro level of market changes. All we do is buy and hold. You\u2019re telling me that these dumb hedgies can\u2019t figure out a way to legally work with that? Then they were never qualified to be in that position. \n\nGME made us woke. Now you have to figure out how to make money rather than manipulating the public with articles released 10 minutes before the price action actually happens. We will hold through your fomenting and your petty ass $1 price target downgrades to justify movement in the stock. \n\nThink about it...their argument is don\u2019t let retail investors trade because it makes our job harder. It\u2019s harder because they were less informed back then than they are now. We have to stop giving them freedom. It wont work....since we have social media to spread real truth. No way to hide information like they used to. If somehow they do find a work around that it would have to be done illegally and unconstitutionally.

        "912":"GME and how my wife's girlfriend is my EX. TLDR:Buy GME low, sell GME high. Get paid many times over the next year.\n\n\nMany a DD has been posted discussing the numbers behind the price changes in GME. I have read a number of them and it's one of a few reasons that GME will pay me twice. However, I have seen very little discussion on something that should be shouted from the goddamn rooftops. Something that would mean GME might pay me 10 more times.\n\n* Collusion!\n\nNo self respecting media outlet will ever publish an article on hedgefund collusion. While I have seen comments here and there about price manipulation and short ladder attacks, almost no one in the media is talking about how several HFs are acting as a group right now. \n\n\nMy first premise for this belief is based on Melvin capital receiving a cash injection from Citadel.  In what world does a professional financial institution look at another professional financial institution, that is bleeding money, and say, \"you guys just lost a shitload of cash, here have some of mine in exchange for...\" no article I have seen has really covered what was received in exchange for the injection. As far as I can tell, it was just friends helping friends. Which for me is a giant sign saying, \"Collusion found here! Come back on Thursday for the Melvin special\" \n\n\nMy second premise for collusion is the message consistency in the media. Nearly every media outlet gets their pocket lined by one hedgefund or another. Jim Cramer admitted as much in his video explaining how hedgefunds manipulate media to influence stock prices. I don't believe that each institution practices manipulation on an individual basis. You would see a lot more conflicting messages if they did. The consistency of the message from the media on GME is astounding. They all have slightly different reasons and theories, but all of them have the exact same conclusion, the shorts covered. **BULL FUCKING SHIT**. \n\n\nMy third and final premise for collusion, is more speculative. I believe that the second wave of GME is another institution winding down their short position. If they can loan each other money to keep their friends liquid, then they can certainly all get together and find a cost effective way to exit their shorts. I believe this is what's happening right now. I think they fucked up so bad, that they have to collude in order to unwind this position or they lose all of their money. \n\n\nIn conclusion\n\n\nThey are colluding on their exits so they don't pay out 10k a share, so they don't have to sell all of their other positions to cover, so the insider whale douchebags can pull out their money and replace it with dumb money to pay us a pittance with, so they can all survive when they fucked up so badly, so they don't get a slap on the hands from uncle Sam, and finally so they can once again fuck the retail investor.\n\n\nWhat do I know, I am an autist who is playing calvinball.

This time, I bought like 2 shares and rode them from $160 to $326. I wouldnt have really cared had these shares gone to shit.\n\nDespite what many people who have a vested interest in this succeeding are telling you, a price increase to 800$ is not **certain.** A lot of shorts have already been and are being covered right now. The volume yesterday and today combined is the same as the total float. This is huge. The volume on Wednesday was 71mil., which is bigger than the actual float. While I am sure that the short interest right now is still very high, because this seems like free money to most hedgefunds a further price increase is not certain at all at these levels. Im confident that 90% of shares shorted at 40-90$ have already been squeezed out, causing the massive price increases to $340. The only way another short squeeze happens is if some insitution decides to make it happen by playing the long side and squeezing out the shares reshorted at 200-300$, but this would be very hard, since the price is already so high. Not impossible but NOT CERTAIN. Despite all the hivemind shit you hear on this sub. YOU NEED TO CONTROL YOUR RISK and if you're betting a large part of your life on this succeeding you should sell gme until movement in the stock doesnt dictate your financial security. Retailers are not driving the price anyway, so dont lose your life savings and go into debt because you saw a \"apes together strong\" meme or some dumb shit.  \n\n\nThe most ironic shit is that if you follow wsb advice you can never win because even if a squeeze happens, the posts here will tell you that \"its not the real squeeze, hold dont sell\", so you can never actually profit from it by selling to the shorts that need to cover. Selling to them is left up to some smart retailers and mainly the institutions that are playing the long game on this. Don't help them, HELP YOURSELF. CONTROL YOUR RISK.

        "917":"Why just purchasing $800 calls isn't enough for \ud83d\ude80 I've read a few times now that the gamma squeeze is best squoze by the purchase of calls, particularly high multiple calls. I even read one apes theory that we should all purhase call options and that all those apes holding 4 shares of GME don't belong on the \ud83d\ude80 with us. This is based on the assumption that MM's who are writing\/selling these options are always hedging by buying the underlying asset, thus creating a huge leverage effect. I believe in some instances this may not be the case. When you look at the sheer number of $800 calls that were purchased and expiring today it far exceeds other more reasonable call levels. Say a MM decided the probability of GME hitting $800 today was exceedingly low, especially since they understand they could actually drive it there through the gamma effect mentioned previously, this MM may decide to just sell all hedging GME shares and sell those options \"naked\" This would have netted them profits from a sideways day of trading  and expiration of calls not in the money.\nThis is why we need to purchase calls at all levels and the underlying asset as well. Each in the money call option does force MM's to hedge. And every diamond handed ape out there is driving the price up too even if they only hold 4 shares.One ape weak, many apes strong!!

I have been the guy who hits the refresh button all day, who GUH's the dips, of course I have in the past had to use credit because I had spent more of my paycheck  than I should have.  I have seen a lot of people who are getting  obsessive to the point its could be unhealthy. We are one of the most chilled out group of autists  I have ever met. Which is why I made this guide to remind you all of a few things. I based this guide off of posts I have seen and replies to posts I have made. Please note I am not speaking about 1 stock in general, this applies to everything market related. I just use GME because its an easy example. \n\n1. It's a good thing the market closes on the Weekend. This cannot be the only thing you focus on. As your parents or wife's boyfriend would tell you \" Go outside\". You need to get out and do other things not related to the stock market. Keep your hobbies, play with your kids, go see your parents. You have to get out and do things other than WSB,and watching tickers all day.\n2. Eat you Autistic pieces of shit. 3 Meals a day I dont care if its all Wendys, you have to eat 3 meals a day. On a serious note either eat some fruit or take a good multi vitamin. For the sake of not spending all of Melvins money on doctors visits please drink some water too.  \n\n3. DON'T SPEND MONEY YOU DON'T HAVE. If I see one more question about how margin works ,how to get approved for margin or if they should yolo all their money on Margin im going to have a stroke.  If you thought losing more than half your initial investment sucks, Imagine losing all you invested because you now owe your broker their portion. Then of course you might owe some interest on that pending on the broker.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4. Dont let this get in the way of your day job. I cleared near half my yearly salary on GME round one. I did this all the while working and not neglecting my responsibilities. I dont care if you're a  bagger at the grocery store or the stim man Crazy Joe. Do your shit so you can pay your bills. If you really cannot help it take some PTO on a day that you think you will need to watch it constantly. Just dont get fired.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n5. Your family probably thinks its cool you're in on something big ( GME for example),but they probably get sick of hearing about it. This should not be the only dialog you have with others around you. Keep that shit here, lets circle jerk. Told the wife today Im back in GME for 3k more ( I have been trying to swing trade it for RD 2 just to do something different all the while catching the squeeze). All she said was \" again?\". Now in RD 1 she was asking about it probably as much as I was looking at it . This is not nearly as cool as many of us think it is. Most people dont get whats happening or do not care. This is ok.\n\n6. Know when to get out. I know this is hard for people from my generation but in this game there are winners and losers. Dont be a fuckin loser you fucking loser. When this shit can change your life take some profit. Stay in diamond hand the shit out of it but take care of you. Someone during this squeeze will still buy at the top Guaranteed . He\/she will HODL and be stuck at sub 10% loss for sure.  Get in before its too late or just say this is not for me this time. \n\n7. Now this is kinda misinformation because the market makes no sense right now but.... Once something reaches the news,social media ,or is being talked about. Its usually too late. BUY the rumor sell the news.Someone out there already knew this before the media did, they got in when it was low. Once its common knowledge these people or firms are already selling leaving you bag holding. \n\n8. Do your DD. No!! not the DD your wife's boyfriend is giving her while you cuck looking at AH tickers on your phone. Research the stock , and decide for yourself. Go to investopedia and educate yourself on the vocabulary. You should know some basics behind stock fundamentals. If Im pushing a stock on here , you do not know me.

That's why after the drop it went right back to $250 and has remained stable yesterday. TODAY WILL BE FUN. AND THE LONGS BEHIND US ARE SMART AND POWERFUL.

        "925":"Future Sole Owner of GameStop Here, With a Breakdown of What's to Come #How do you do, fellow investors?\n\n*obligatory: I eat crayons dipped in paste and nothing here should be taken as financial advice. if you make any investment decisions based on what you read here, expect to lose money. you have been warned.*\n\nLooking at the recent market shenanigans, the price action, you damn dirty apes investing heavily in this ex-blockbuster-esque company that ***I*** intend to own, aaand the way short sellers \/ big fish \/ hedgies are using GME to engage in their pissing contests... I've finally figured out how this shit's gonna go. And you better believe I'm poising myself to acquire this company in the process.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Here's how this is about to shake out with GameStop in the coming weeks\/months:\n\n- **The stock ain't going smoothly over $350.** When and if it does... Get ready for the planet to get knocked off its axis. $350 is apparently a magic number Melvin and the shorters are *terrified* of. Not sure why, but each time we get too close, their strategies go from what can only be described as \"Absolute Unfair Horseshit\" to \"Fuck It, Burn Everything to the Ground\" in a split second. They probably think everything they've been doing in between Feb 2nd and yesterday was \"playing nice.\" Well, if Melvin wants to play that way, fine. I'll be positioning myself to make out like a BANDIT if this thing never breaks $350 again. Say goodbye to what little liquidity remains. It's all gonna be mine. I'll even take all of those shares they seems to be pulling out of thin air to borrow. It's yoinkin' time.\n\n- **She ain't Fallin under $200 again pre-squeeze.** Somewhere in the range of $200-250 seems to be the new floor. This might be because of you diamond hand apes do not budge when your portfolio goes down 50-90%, or maybe it's because a shit ton of whales we don't even know about are sitting on massive limit buys, should it drop again. Either way, I think it's pretty clear that we are hanging out up here for a while. Which is... Fine. It's a bit expensive for me to throw more real life money at it haphazardly, but since I'm gonna be making my consistent moves in the range of $200-350, you better believe I got price traps in place all the way down from $200 to $50. And if it ever drops to or below $50 again, I'm just gonna get reckless buying with real life money. Doubt this will happen though, as it seems a lot of folks with more money to risk (and shorter term plans) are gonna catch the hell out of any dips. My business is picking up, and my accountant verified what I am doing in the market is basically a totally legal cheat code. So game on.\n\n- **GME shareholders will look more and more like a cult (again).** This should come as no surprise. Last round they took weeks to slide the stock value from $200 to under $40 (bad move, baby) and apes held together strong. All the paper hands pissed off and joined thetagang or gamestopmeltdown and those who remained vigilant have been rewarded. No matter what happens now, even if it goes to $1\/share, most of y'all are gonna take those to your grave. Only way out is up, and the further they press it down the more devout the apes become (only this time, I'm here. Drinking Melvin's milkshake with my verrrry long straw).\n\n- **The squeeze will happen, or I will own GameStop.** Either one will happen, or both will happen. But it is mathematically impossible for neither to happen. This strategy formed after weeks and weeks of watching GME drop after Feb 2, staring at every play retail investors could make, and realizing the **only** people capable of making money on that particular price action were short sellers (IV was high, but the stock didn't move quite fast enough for puts to print, selling calls to outpace the loss of value holding shares, or even CSPs to result in a profitable outcome)... The way I'm playing options and shares to amass all shares in the market is literally *accelerated* by the very short-seller-profiting bullshit that went down Feb 2nd to Feb 22nd.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Mark my words.** The only way I fail is if GME rockets past $350 between now and April, and stays there.\n\ntl;dr - Looks like it's just \ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd1a\ud83e\udd8ds, Short Sellers, and Hedge Funds \/ Whales now. Get ready for \"stagnation\" in GME price (high volatility sideways trading). Anything but up will help me accomplish my goal.\n\nY'all win or I win. The only people who are guaranteed to lose are the short sellers.\n\nSee y'all from the boardroom.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nedit: positions (currently holding both) - [1500 shares in RH; most recent update](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/m27s55\/gonna_own_gamestop_update_mar_10_2021_drop_the\/) | [60 shares in Fidelity; previous update](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/m0ycue\/i_will_own_gamestop_update_mar_8_2021\/)",

Because weed is still illegal, most companies have a hard time renting or purchasing spaces.  If the owner of the building has a mortgage with Wells Fargo or JP Morgan, the building is basically unavailable.  This is why cannabis REITS have been crushing it this year.  The Senate Majority leader, Chuck Schumer, has recently rekindled the idea about passing the SAFE act.  This would allow these companies to use major banks if they are in legal states.  Besides the fact that this would enhance their ability to set up shop around the US, think about what this could mean for companies looking to go global like Curaleaf.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.marketplace.org\/2021\/02\/26\/will-congress-consider-giving-marijuana-companies-access-to-big-banks\/\n\nI don't know if legalization is around the corner, but frankly I don't care.

I haven't fully looked into them but I think that any US based cannabis play is good.  My analysis up top I think points out why US based cannabis has a higher potential for explosive growth and a lot of the comments point it out as well.\n\nEDIT 2:  $MO (Altria\/Phillip Morris) owns logistics in this space and they already sell tabacco through multiple delivery methods.  They are traded on the NYSE already and have a solid stock buy back and good dividends.  If legalization gets to the point were it can be sold in gas stations, think of the return.  MO has a bigger market cap than any other company but ORTEX gives them a lower PE and EPS ( $MO EPS 2.40 P\/E 10.21; $CURLF ($CURA on CSE) P\/E 210.98 EPS 25.97) and my guess is because of debt and the lawsuits they will be paying out until time ends.  Analyst return recommendations on Ortex also have a higher 12 month return potential for CURLF\/CURA (%25 vs. %2.9).  With that being said, MO is not selling weed to scale but when they do the growth can be explosive.  My one year play is still $CURLF but I will be hedging with $MO.  I think $MO is the superior long play especially if they get out of debt.",

The short sellers did cover most of their positions (140% SI is now 50% maybe, the author claims 30%). I'm pretty sure people claiming otherwise (like 200%-900%) are misinterpreting data (thinking short volume == short interest or something) or just straight up lying because they know it'll get upvotes.\n\n(Edit: Even if SI is in fact high, this doesn't contradict the theory)\n\n# So GME is fucked if SI is low?\n\n**Not at all.** There seems to be (according to the expert above) a particularly surprising and novel strategy emerging. He's calling it a \"gamma swarm\" and it works like this:\n\n# Call sellers are going short, but not for long\n\nWhen you sell a call you're betting that the option won't be exercised. That's it. If the price goes down, it's not going to be exercised and you pocket the money from the sale.\n\nBut what if it goes up? Then you have to cough up some shares and sell them for the strike price listed on the call option contract. With American calls this can happen at any time. With European calls this can only happen at the expiration date. That's the gamble when you sell call options.\n\nBig players don't play this gambling game.  **They only try to make a small amount of relatively risk-free money, but they do it millions of times.** That means they sell the call option and if the price starts to go up they buy the underlying shares. This way they can still pocket the premium they charged selling the initial contract. Why not buy the shares immediately? They sell \ud83d\ude80 calls to \ud83e\udd8d (like $800c) and if they bought every time they sold some of those, there'd be pretty much no shares left. So they wait for a bit and see where the price goes.\n\n# How long do they wait?\n\nFor GME? 1-5 minutes. That's wild.\n\n# How does this impact GME?\n\nAt the time of writing this, the [call sellers are selling](https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/quote\/GME\/options?p=GME) a single $300c contract for $21.10. That contract must be purchased in a bundle of 100, so the buyer pays $2,110.\n\nNow, if the seller decides to hedge (**which is more likely if the call option is near the money**), they'll go and purchase 100 shares. Assuming the price is near the strike price, that's $30,000 worth of shares. So the buyer just motivated an institutional purchase of over 10x what they paid.\n\n# So, ultimately, what's happening?\n\nThe author has a lot of interesting claims so I highlighted a couple out of order:\n\n\"This leverage has changed the game. It will be \u201cinteresting\u201d to watch as traders probe the market with this new instrument, to find out what it can really do.

The gamma squeeze theory seems a very credible explanation for the volatility.\n\nHere are a couple of other thoughts I had while reading the article that support a very bearish case:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. **A gamma squeeze needs at      least two criteria for the the stock to keep rising:**\n\n**a)** People buying OTM calls in very large volumes\n\n**b)** The stock rises to a unexpectedly rapidly to a point where those calls sold by market makers are in the money and they need to buy stock (or calls themselves, of different delta's and expiry's ) to re-hedge.\n\nThere are at serious problems for the bulls if these conditions don't occur and we may well see a share price implosion as the gamma squeeze ends - remember this is the only thing keeping up the price at this moment - as it's clearly not fundamentals (it's a 15-25$ stock) or a short squeeze.\n\n**Here the issues with condition a)**\n\nLooking at the ATM weekly call 250$, expiring March 19, we see from yesterdays price that it is $7500 (75$) giving a breakeven price at expiry ( not paying any attention to the other greeks. which given the theta decay and possible IV movements will hurt the buyer) of $325.\n\nThe 350$ strike with the same expiry trades at around 47$ (4700$)giving a break even price of 397$.\n\nNow, the problem with this is simple: These very risky call options are simply far to pricey for the average ape to afford, even those well OTM. **Usually the retards might be able to afford a short term (weekly) OTM lottery ticket type option that you see yolo'ed here on WSB all the time, but in this case due to the rise in share price and insanely high premium (implied volatility) , the vast majority of apes are well priced out - a $7500 or even riskier $4700 option that expires in a week is way beyond the budget of these guys.**\n\nIn addition, IV has been rising on the increased volatility the last couple of days AND earnings is just two weeks away. IV typically rises strongly on options coming into earnings, so these calls will become even more expensive (even if no share price drop occurs). Ironically the gamma spike will become a victim of it's own success.\n\n**Here are the issues with condition b)**\n\nOf course, the share price is pretty volatile day to day so I'm not going to try to predict it, but I would note a couple of important points:\n\n\\- The share price has risen due to the gamma squeeze (see article) and once people realize this many who don't understand it or thought the reason was due to a short squeeze may become very fearful as a gamma squeeze is a very short term phenomenon. The holders will see the share price as completely outside their control and holding or 'buying the dip\" (retailers volume is estimated to be around 1\/10th of institutions\/MM's\/quant funds\/ hedgies, most days at least) makes no difference - this isn't a short squeeze after all. Additionally they will see that as the share price is totally dependent on what the hedge funds want to do with it and can be manipulated at will ( see yesterdays 40% drop in 20 minutes) to suit their needs, and we don't know what hedge funds are long put options or long the stock (short term algos) and so on. Maybe they want it up temporarily if they are running momentum based algos or calls, but if they hold puts they will want it down. We simply don't know for sure, other than to note the current open interest put\/call ratio is around 3:1 - or the market has about 3x as many open puts as it does calls.\n\nMore importantly for the share price to 'gamma squeeze' you NEED condition a) to be fulfilled. It is the engine of the rocket and for fuel needs retards to buy OTM calls on mass. This is not happening anymore.\n\n\\- Secondly, the gamma squeeze is caused by market makers (who essentially want to be approximately delta neutral) re-hedging their position. Again this poses massive risks for bulls, as you need to consider what will happen if the share price begins to drop. As the price drops those OTM and ATM calls they sold to autists and the general trader will begin to decline in value. Now if the price drops enough ( as an example if you bought just before the halt that ATM weekly (250 strike) call was worth around 141$ and it dropped to 73$, a massive loss) the market makers will begin to re-hedge their risk in any of these ways:\n\n\\- Buy the call back for a significant discount ( or leave it for a few days to get it even cheaper due to theta decay). This means they can sell all 100 shares they may of been holding before as a hedge to price rises.\n\n\\- Buy the now other (now) much cheaper calls\\* to hedge their original sold call and sell some of the shares used to hedge\n\nNow, I've kind of skipped over the details here, but this is the essence of what should\/could happen. Now of course, those calls\\* themselves that are used to re-hedge will also have to be re-hedged by other market makers, but usually it's much cheaper to re-hedge a suddenly OTM call that you sold for maybe 50 delta that has dropped to 20 delta - it requires less purchase of the underlying. **So basically the net effect of a price drop will cause kind of a chain reaction - as the price drops, the market makers rehedge their sold calls and sell shares, and this in turn drops the price and the pattern continues.** It has similarities ( but is NOT the same -I'm not saying that at all) to a gamma squeeze, except now it's reversed, and the price drops caused by such a chain reaction probably wouldn't be as violent. This is because the potential upside on calls is unlimited (stock price can moon indefinitely - in theory) and thus are riskier for market makers, but if they sell a put the most they can lose is capped when the stock hits 0.\n\n**TLDR:**\n\nBulls are likely fuk if the gamma squeeze can't be sustained. This is due to market makers re-hedging ATM\/OTM sold calls and no longer needing to hold underlying shares as a hedge in the same quantities thus selling the shares and further driving down the price.\n\nWhatever happens bulls are fuk as this was a gamma squeeze from 40ish$ up to crazy numbers and gamma squeezes correct very quickly (hours\/days) especially once people realize what is going on.\n\n**Positions:**\n\nTons of different puts spreads at different strikes at expiry's 23-43 days out.\n\n**Edit**: A helpful person mentioned that I should have explicitly stated that you need **both extremely bullish ITM and OTM** call option activity to create a gamma squeeze. I totally agree and should have mentioned that.",

These are my thoughts based on the price action yesterday.\n\nSomeone made a shit ton of money from the drop.\n\nSo as most of you know a good deal of the price action over the last few days has been caused by high volume ATM call option buying rolling forward as the price climbs, and subsequent MM delta hedging.\n\nSomeone set a trap, buying a shit ton of puts OTM for cheap in a relatively low period of IV%, allowed the price to run up, then shorted the fuck out of the stock.

        "936":"Discussing about Forbes article and possible gamma squeeze retaliation If you haven't read that Forbes article that came out today, you should. It's really interesting and helped me understand the underlying mechanisms driving this GME growth, and why it will continue: www.forbes.com\/sites\/georgecalhoun\/2021\/03\/10\/gamestop-the-second-surgeanatomy-of-a-gamma-swarm\/\n\nHowever, it also gave me an idea of what happened today and I want some feedback on the theoretical, and thoughts on why they wouldn't just keep doing this.\n\nThe article describes the price rise driven by the need for MM to cover calls. If they sell 100k calls on a volatile and rising stock, that are very likely going to actually buy those shares so the calls are covered. After two weeks of heavy call volume, they have maybe 1mil shares purchased at various prices that they will lose money on if the price keeps rising and they print. Let's say they're average price is $275 but the average call strike is $250.\n\nI don't understand options enough to know if this scenario is reasonable out how much money they would stand to lose, so apologies if I'm drifting off base.\n\nSo if I'm sitting on a million shares looking down the barrel of massive losses and I know I can't stop the increasing price, why not flood the market with those million shares I have so the price plummets, and then buy them back at much lower prices to bring my average down and possibly actually make money delivering ITM calls? It would almost be like buying the shares two weeks before selling the calls... Charging current rates on shares you bought at a discount.\n\nSo in this scenario, they may have dumped shares for an average price of $300, banking that $25 premium, but since they NEED those shares for delivery, and aren't willing to take the risk that their stunt will keep the price depressed, they buy them back at an average of $225, $25 less than the average call strike.\n\nThey net $50 per share without taking the risk of selling uncovered calls. If they're smart they used that additional $50 profit to buy additional shares at the depressed price so they can sell additional covered calls with a lower cost basis.\n\nSo... Can someone tell me why this wouldn't work? Or why it's probably not what happened. Because I'm sitting here, after the fact, thinking to myself, \"if I was an evil fuck, with loads of money to push shit around, and I don't want to lose  any of it, what would I do?\" And this is exactly what I would do.\n\nAnd if this is a reasonable hypothesis about what happened, what's to stop them from doing it every week? I know it doesn't hurt us financially (just psychologically) if we hold through it, but it will eventually scare more and more people away. What's the recourse? Anyone care to weigh in?",
        "937":"Why the price of GME shares could reach anywhere from $12k to $28k While reading through comments on WSB this week, I've seen a fair amount of skepticism regarding some popular price targets for GME. This post is an attempt to bring some context to some of these price targets. \n\nConsider the fact that, even if GameStop's market capitalization briefly reaches $2T, it still will not be the most valuable company in the world (that title will remain with Apple). **At a market cap of $2T, shares of GME will be worth $28,680.** At a share price of $10k, GameStop's market capitalization will be  \\~$700B, less than those of companies such as Alibaba, Tencent, Facebook, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple.\n\nNow, from the perspective of fundamentals, it doesn't make sense to compare GameStop's market cap to those of the companies just mentioned. However, in the context of a short squeeze, it seems like a reasonable comparison, especially in light of any evidence supporting the possibility that GameStop will briefly become the most valuable company in the world. And that possibility is quite plausible. \n\nRemember that Volkswagen became the most valuable company in the world when the price of its shares spiked in the midst of a short squeeze in 2008. You might say, \"Well, maybe market caps were more uniformly distributed in 2008, so the bar for VW was lower.\" Ok, fair point. But at the peak of the VW short squeeze, VW attained a market cap of \\~$420B. According to The World Bank (see [https:\/\/data.worldbank.org\/indicator\/CM.MKT.LCAP.CD](https:\/\/data.worldbank.org\/indicator\/CM.MKT.LCAP.CD)), the total market cap of all listed domestic companies worldwide was $32.27T in 2008, and $68.65T in 2018. So at the peak of the VW short squeeze, VW accounted for roughly 0.42\/32.27 = 1.3% of total market cap. In 2018, 1.3% of total market cap was $0.013\\*68.65T = $893B. **At a market cap of $893B, GME shares will be worth $12,806.** And this is a conservative estimate, since the current total market cap is considerably larger than it was in 2018.\n\nTL;DR: The price of GME shares could reach anywhere from $12k to $28k.

        "938":"The Theories on Today's Drop Hey everyone! Today was obviously quite eventful, and it looks like we're gearing up for a very active Thursday and Friday. There have been a few differing theories & perspectives I've seen posted here on why the price of GME, AMC, and etc. plummeted and then recovered (though not fully) and I was thinking it'd be a good idea to collect some of the different theories in one place so we can assess their validity for ourselves. Here are the theories I've heard so far - will edit this post to add more if anyone in the comments suggests additional theories and can provide a rationale that *could* make sense. Also TLDR at bottom.\n\n- The Short Hedgefunds Theory: The HFs that are shorting GME decided to flood the market with low-priced shares to drop the price down and get people to panic sell.\n- [The Short HFs and Media Theory:](https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/m2dil9\/the_gme_dip_today_was_shock_a_coordinated_effort\/) Beyond just the action from the shorting HFs, some people have also suggested that the media is in cahoots with these shorting HFs because of how quickly they posted about the price dropping. There have been a few pieces of evidence for this claim, but no real \"smoking gun\". Some of the evidence has been:\n 1. Articles were coming out about the drop roughly 20 minutes after the drop started. Some people are suggesting this is too short of a timeframe to write and publish an article. I personally think this is inaccurate given how quickly I've seen the media publish articles about stock movements in the past, but that's just my opinion.\n 2. Google indexed a news article about the drop 14 hours before it was posted. [Another user posted reasoning of why they think this isn't sufficient proof.](https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/m2dil9\/the_gme_dip_today_was_shock_a_coordinated_effort\/gqin9qf\/)\n 3. There have been screenshots of an article that was posted about an hour before the drop happened, talking about the drop. I haven't been able to find the article with this timestamp so am skeptical of this + think it may be photoshopped, but I'm unsure who would lie about this and what their motivation would be.\n- The Bullish Hedgefunds Theory: A bit similar to the shorting HFs theory, however, this theory suggests that the price drop was actually caused by HFs who are bullish on GME, AMC, etc - the same ones who some have theorized caused our current run-up in the first place. The evidence for this is that a massive amount of OTM call options were purchased when the drop occurred. I personally think this is the most likely scenario, as I don't see how that many options could be bought on the downswing by retail alone. That said, it could be that people were checking out the options prices while trading was halted and then made their purchases as soon as trading unfroze.\n\nThis is what I've seen so far - let me know if there's anything further I should add!\n\nTLDR: HODL",

Last week I drew out a chart looking like this\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/acopf56dr9m61.png?width=1184&format=png&auto=webp&s=921fe515d9d1fe8b49c7fc0ff410a016c0b3d5d6\n\nLets see the results...\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/8odmmly13am61.png?width=1142&format=png&auto=webp&s=0860362e90fb97b8484df24335ec93dc79e259e4\n\nThe chart played out perfectly with the 3rd daily candle now sitting around the $260 area. The only difference is the chart has a **retarded doji** instead of a normal candlestick. This retarded doji now makes me think the squeeze potential is much higher & close to happening. Let me break it down. **The GME rocket is nearly fuelled up ready to go full retard mode.**\n\nWe have just completed a cup & handle gap fill from a gamma squeeze which is why the stock has pushed up this week, however the stock has the ability to push a lot further before the eventual short squeeze. This is due to **IV** (implied volatility). For instance, let's say GME increased from $260 to $269, that would be a 9 dollar difference with a 3.4% increase. Now let's say GME was $20 and increased by the same amount of dollars to $29. It would be the same dollar difference but with a 45% increase in share price this time. This is the exact reason why the gamma squeeze in January was unsustainable and died down quickly because it had a low IV. It went all the way from around $15 to $450 in a quick space of time which the stock itself couldn't handle. Now that GME has had a steady increase to $260 per share, it has a much higher IV & will be able to sustain a $450 price tag without crashing down as it would only be a 73% increase. It's crucial that GME sustains this gradual increase in share price so it can increase it's IV and have the ability to go to **$69420 per share** from a technical point of view.\n\n**Why the stock was heavily attacked today & what the stock needs to do to go to $69420 per share and why it WILL**\n\nWe established that GME had enough IV to go from $15 to $450 for a brief period of time, that's a 3000% increase. That means that if GME can slowly get to $2314 per share, this will be the launch pad for GME to increase by 3000% to go to $69420 per share. To go to $2314 from where it's at now at $265, that's only an 873% increase which is much less than the 3000% increase in January. A crucial point was when the stock recently ran up from $40 to consolidating at $120, this is CRUCIAL as the fact the stock didn't crash back down means that the 300% increase is sustainable for the IV. Using this calculation I can concur that in order for GME to get to $2314 per share & stay there, it needs to slowly run up to $772 per share so it can increase by 300% to get to $2314 and be a sustainable launch pad to $69420. This is why the hedge funds short attacked the stock today with all they could as they realised this and are scared shitless.\n\nIf a low IV causes a major move to the upside to crash back down, that means that a major move to the DOWNSIDE will cause the stock to go UP. This is why hedge funds are truly FUCKED because this was their only opportunity to try & trigger a sell off to cover at a low price and they could only get it down to $180. They still haven't covered yet. What they have done now is actually increase the IV of the stock with the retarded doji and now it may be EVEN easier to get to $69420. **If you see another sharp drop again due to a short attack it is nothing to fear, I am only talking about how GME needs a steady uprise, it doesn't matter if it has sharp dips, they only make it easier for the stock to rise quicker.**\n\n***I have to say it's very dirty what the hedge funds tried to do today... make the stock tank 40% then put out pre written articles about the tank to scare people into selling. That is not only chart manipulation but a malicious attack directly towards the company and it's shareholders who just like the stock & weren't ready for a 40% loss on their investment. It's not the shareholder's fault that hedge funds naked shorted a stock over 100%, that's a conscious decision they made themselves to do & turned out to be a bad one. It shouldn't be the reason why honest shareholder's saw an unprecedented 40% loss on their investment today.***\n\n**TL;DR** I like the stock & it's fundamentals, I think it's a great company. They generated over 6B revenue before the pandemic and are now transforming their business model into e-commerce. I believe they will become one of the world's leading gaming companies. I am very bullish on GME. I like the stock. It seems to have a lot of respect from the public who also like the stock & the company. I believe the entry point of $269 per share is a great long term hold, the short squeeze is just another attraction & interesting to see & analyse\n\nThis is not financial advice, I am just a retard who did some math and came up with random numbers",
        "945":"Detailed Analysis to Explain What Happened Today. Just Look at Volume. **TLDR:  $GME Volume during 12:20pm - 12:41pm crash indicates this was either a large  whale sell order (unlikely) or algorithmic short selling (likely). Keep  HOLDING!**\n\nJust like you, I  was stunned, amazed, bewildered, and intrigued as the price of $GME  fell like a falling knife within minutes. As I watched the price  plummet, the relatively low volume that transpired during that cliff  dive didn't make sense to me.\n\nLet's dive in.\n\n[$GME Daily Chart and Volume](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/zq8ft5pm4am61.jpg?width=1320&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=57cbbd3d5c04822441a1ffa5c3d3028b473eab5f)\n\nLet's zoom into the drop that started around 12:20 PM.\n\n[Price and Volume Chart in Minute Increments](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/bdd39mde4am61.jpg?width=1320&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=35fef4c2488fe6c24abd3fdfdafe91a30d4d913b)\n\nAs  the price dropped, the peak minute volume was 936.7K. From 12:20 PM to  the bottom at 12:41 PM, the total volume traded was 4.32 million shares.  In the grand scheme of things, this is NOT A LOT of volume for such a  violent price move.\n\nThis points to two possibilities in my mind.\n\n**Possibility #1 (Unlikely)**\n\nThe  first possibility is that this was a large sell order by a whale  looking to cash out. This is less likely in my opinion. If an actual  whale was trying to sell out of its position, it would not sell all of  its shares at one time cratering the stock price and inducing halts.  They would trickle in sell orders throughout the day to get out of their  position and maximize profit. This was definitely NOT retail selling,  you could barely even put in a sell order fast enough when this was  dropping.\n\n**Possibility #2 (Likely)**\n\nThe  second possibility is that this was an algorithmic short attack to  induce fear and panic selling. This is more likely in my opinion. If you  look at the total volume during this time-frame along with the rate the  stock was falling, this screams of a deliberate short attack. The  volume throughout the week was not high enough to indicate shorts have  covered. Conversely, there are actually less shares available to short  at the end of the day. According to multiple websites, there are now  only 150,000 shares available to short.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn  conclusion, this was most likely an algorithmic short attack from  12:20pm to 12:41pm. GME's thesis has not changed. A gamma squeeze is  also a likely possibility tomorrow through Friday. I believe GME is  restricted to short on upticks only (SSR) till tomorrow so it should be  an exciting Thursday. Keep holding and remember... ALL SHORTS MUST COVER!",

        "949":"Today's GME manipulation Okay retards. Here is what I think happened today while you were busy shitting out the crayons you had for lunch. \n\nToday's GME dip was clearly a short attack. Most likely manipulation based on the sketchy timing of some articles, but my point is independent on that. I think as fucked up as it is to hear this, some hedge funds won on this one and that can even be good for us. Hear me out before you start screaming like the apes we are. \n\nFirst, there is absolutely no way retail had anything to do with this. We sure as hell  didn't cause such a strong dip by paper handling coincidentally all of us all of a sudden,  this was an orchestrated short attack. The interesting part was how it bounced back. And I believe that again there is no way retail had anything to do with it. How much money do we really have left to fight such an enormous dip at this point? We are balls deep in already. We apes keep saying to each other \"BUY THE DIP\" but let's face it, we ain't got no money left to buy the damn dip. We have put everything we have and beg our wife's boyfriend to give us some ramen noodles for dinner. \n\nSo here is what I think happened.\n\n1) Short attack by hedge funds which caused many stop losses to be activated. They then covered back that short attack, making gains from panicked day traders, stop losses, algos that started selling and paper handed bitches. \n\nOr\n\n2) The bounce back was again made by hedges, opposing ones this time. It's a war out of there and even though most hedge funds are owned and run by corrupt greedy douchebags, some of them are on our side, the long side of the trade. Or they have no skin in the direction of the game and simply like volatility. These are the ones that profited from today and fucked the shorts.\n\nSo what now my fellow gorillas? We view this as a good sign. Even if some hedge funds won, either the ones that shorted and profited like in case 1, or opposing hedge funds like case 2, what we want is high volatility. High volatility leads to more madness, more shorting and more chaos. This is what is gonna send us flying to the moon. We won't fly to Jupiter on a 5% day gain, we need the volatility. If you hate volatility go play boomer stocks.\n\n\nTLDR Hedge funds are most likely at war. High volatility is good for us. GME to the moon.",

I currently hold over 6 digits of value in GME and I hope to reach my 7 digits and possibly 8. After what happened today, my 7 digits is certain, 8 digits possible. With more crayons maybe I'll reach 9.\n\nThat being said I like to share and encourage with everyone why this nosedive drop we seen today is actually the BEST affirmation we really need.\n\nThere's been wonderful DD that the Short interest are still extremely high and that the data in FINRA is entirely unreliable. Let's be honest, before what happened today, no matter how certain we are, we weren't 100% sure.\n\nI'm an expert in Chinese history, and I'll quote Sun Tzu, the famed author recognised for writing the Art of War over 2000 years ago.\n\n\u201cIf you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.\u201d\n\nTruth is we never really knew what the hedges were up to and this week was really fishy, with the absence of obvious short ladders and peaceful markets. Other than occasional dips everyday after reaching a peak, we couldn't tell much. Some people have speculated that maybe the hedges were buying calls in order to reduce their risks, but I think we can all agree now that there is a good possibility that the dips we've been seeing the last few days are just a test for hedges to see how much the price can be affected.\n\nAnd let's be honest with ourselves, that was a coordinated attack. I have no idea how long they have planned that, but looking from what we've seen, it's definitely a lot of time. At that scale it's not possible for 1 or 2 hedge funds to pull this off by themselves. And YET!! This is where we recovered strong.\n\nSo what this means is this. The hedges are panicking. They are worried. And they have proven that the shorts *HAVE NOT BEEN COVERED*. If they have been covered to the large extent they claimed to, today's coordinated attack wouldn't have happened.\n\nNot just did they admit with their actions that they are fearing us, they also basically highlighted to us what stocks they are all massively shorting. AMC, KOSS, NOK, BB all are in this together with us GME Army! \n\nYou know it's like Harry Potter, where Voldemort basically handed the weapons to Harry by his own hands.\n\nBased on Chinese History, there's this clever strategist Sun Tzu. For him before he executes any clever maneuvers for war, he will always test them first. If the hedges we are up against are the same smooth brain people like Sun Tzu, this fall is only a test. But it's costly to them and we have held strong. With the current prices, supposing they did buy some shares to cover their losses, all those buys from 180 to 250 are all gone. Now they are forced to buy shares above 260 and its only going to cost them even more.

I hope this is helpful for you apes.\n\nHere is my analysis:\n\n* **Charlie Bucket** - Throughout the movie and the book, Charlie is represented as the typical retail investor \ud83e\udd8d.  \n* **Willy Wonka** - (sometimes represented as a bandana-wearing \"Not-a-Cat\" cunning analyst) informs the retail investors \ud83e\udd8d of his analysis of a particular stock that he likes.  And if you like the candy (stock) \ud83c\udf6c, buy it, as it may have a golden ticket. \ud83c\udfab\n* Large corporations \ud83c\udfe2 buy large amounts of candy (stock) \ud83c\udf6c because they believe Willy Wonka's candy factory (Gamestop) \ud83c\udff0  is going to fail. \n* After sometime passes, the large corporations' plan fails as retail investors start finding golden tickets \ud83c\udfab in the candy \ud83c\udf6c they purchase causing more retail investors to buy.\n* With candy supplies \ud83c\udf6c being so low, corporations need to buy candy at higher costs \ud83d\ude80.  Not liking this, the corporations \ud83c\udfe2 restrict limits on the amount of candy \ud83c\udf6c which can be purchased.\n* One day, with the coordination of the media, a corporate good shows up on television and states the final golden ticket \ud83c\udfab has been found.  This sends the price of candy \ud83c\udf6c crashing.\n* Charlie finds a dollar and buys a few bars of candy.  Inside the bar, he finds a golden ticket. \ud83c\udfab  The corporation has been lying about their position all long.  The price of candy \ud83c\udf6c increases. \ud83d\ude80  All this time, Charlie had \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50.\n\n***Willy Wonka's Factory Guests*** \ud83c\udff0 \n\n* **Augustus Gloop** - Augustus loves chocolate.\ud83c\udf6b  The moment, he saw the chocolate river (gains), he fell in the river, getting stuck in the pipe.  Augustus had paper hands.  Augustus should have held. \n* **Violet Beauregarde** - Violet chewed gum all the time.  When she saw the new chewing gum prototypes, her dad urged her to keep on chewing despite the others in the group to stop.  As Violet was turning into a big blueberry \ud83d\udd35, her dad cheered her on.  The Oompa-Loompas had to roll her out of the roll her out of the room and de-juice her.  Her dad was a corporate shill and did not care about her position.  He put his own interests before hers.  He would be encouraging stockholders to do things that would damage their positions to benefit his or his hedge funds.\n* **Veruca Salt** - When Veruca saw the squirrels \ud83d\udc3f opening the nuts \ud83c\udf30, she wanted one right away.  She insisited on obtaining a nut \ud83c\udf30 opening squirrel \ud83d\udc3f instead of practicing patience.  When she tried to steal a squirrel \ud83d\udc3f, they ganged up on her, throwing her in the nut \ud83c\udf30 chute.  Veruca needs to learn that you cannot rush a squeeze.  You need to practice patience.  Her dad was going to buy a squirrel \ud83d\udc3f.  That's what you do during a squeeze: buy and wait.\n* **Mike Teavee** - After going to the TV room \ud83d\udcfa, the group is told Wonka-vision is going to revolutionize the world.  Mike Teavee was going to have none of that and immediately gets on the the stage and transports himself to a smaller state.  Mike Teavee is the ultimate case of Buy High \ud83d\udcc8, Sell Low \ud83d\udcc9.  The others learned that Wonka's mission is going to help everyone who is fighting FOR the cause, not against it.\n\n***Other Characters***\n\n* ***Grandpa Joe*** - During the tour, Grandpa Joe passes a room with bottles of soda \ud83c\udf7e.  Grandpa convinces Charlie to drink the soda \ud83c\udf7e.  The soda \ud83c\udf7e causes Charlie and Grandpa Joe to fly and almost hit a ventilation fan.  Thankfully, Charlie finds a way to get out of the position and they are both safe.  Grandpa may be a corporate shill and tried to distract Charlie with worthless positions so he can take advantage of Charlie's position.  Do not get distracted.  Stay focused on your own goal.\n* ***Arthur Slugworth*** - Before entering the factory, Arthur Slugworth bribes Charlie to commit sabotage by sneaking out an Everlasting Gobstopper \ud83c\udf6d.  Later in the movie, Slugworth turns out to be someone employed by the Wonka factory to test if Charlie can be trusted.  Some posters can be trusted with their posts, others cannot.  It is up to you to investigate if their gain porn or loss porn is fabricated.  Is their Due Diligence accurate or not?  Is their YouTube stream paid for by hedges or are they grifting?\n\n***That Scary River Scene*** \ud83d\udc79\n\n* The scene on the river is similar to CNBC, the Senate Hearings, and other media outlets trying to scare retail investors to sell their shares.  As a kid, it was scary as hell, but we all turned out ok, right??\n\n***Conclusion***\n\n* In the end, Charlie held \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50 and won the Chocolate Factory.  The last scene of the movie was the elevator, crashing through the roof and going \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 to the moon \ud83c\udf1a\ud83c\udf1a\ud83c\udf1a.\n\n\n\n***TL:DR;***  Charlie \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50 crashed through the roof, \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 to the moon \ud83c\udf1a\ud83c\udf1a\ud83c\udf1a.  The others paper handed, tried to distract Charlie, and got roasted. \n\nThis is not financial advice.  This is not a movie review.  I am not a financial adviser.  I am not a movie critic.

        "956":"This is why GAMESTOP won't STOP, and why $100k is NOT A MEME. (REPOSTED) REPOST because I accidently included a relevant YouTube link in an edit (about a DRYS short squeeze) and this caused the automoderator to delete it). Sorry!\n\nAlso, since I got feedback I didn't include enough Emojis, here's a rectification:\n\n# \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83c\udf19\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50\n\nFirst, let's look at the players involved here.\n\n# The shorts\n\nOn the short side, we have some hedge funds (most notably Melvin and Citadel) who aimed to make money by shorting gamestop, which they saw as a failing brick and mortar store chain.\n\n# The Market Makers (may have some overlap with the shorts)\n\nMarker makers write options (contracts to be allowed to buy (call) or sell (put) shares for a specific price at or before the expiry date). They collect a fee for selling those contracts, but they make the best profit if the contracts expiry worthless, because then they get to keep their fee, and don't need to keep their contract because it wasn't in the money. How does this work? Well, for example when GME was trading around $40, they sold contracts for $800 for the next month or so, never expecting the price of GME to even reach anywhere near $800, so the \"fools\" who bought the options to buy $800 calls for march 12th and march 19 will be left with worthless calls, or so they thought. (More on this later).\n\n# The longs\n\nOn the long side, we have you glorious apes  \ud83e\udd8d \ud83e\udd8d \ud83e\udd8d, Cohen, and competing hedge funds who are smelling blood and do not hesitate to pull the trigger on Melvin and other shorts, especially if they can make some money while doing so.\n\nNow let's look at the actions that have led up to this.\n\nIt all started when the shorts were getting greedy, and with Covid19 thought they could pull the plug on gamestop, which they saw as a failing brick and mortar game store that would go the way of blockbuster. They did not expect gamestop would survive covid, and they did everything in their power to make it so. Shorting the company to the ground, with the goal being to drive the price to $0 for maximum and tax-free profit. It's important to point out that they COULD have covered at $3\\~$4 but DID NOT. If they did not cover at $3 or $4, what makes you think they covered at $40\\~$400? Hint: they didn't. In fact, they even admitted during the congress hearing to not covering by saying that the last peak to $400+ was just a gamma squeeze. In other words they have not even begun to cover yet.\n\n[Then some people liked the stock](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/m1p4up\/a_refresher_on_what_the_is_going_on_with_gme\/)\n\n[Some people have calculated that the real short interest in somewhere between 250% and 967%](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/m19sa7\/true_short_interest_in_gee_em_ee_could_be\/). (something like 200 million to 500 million shares short). Some people may think this is insane, but if you do the math, you will see that no matter what FINRA says, it's impossible for short interest to be below 200%, and it's more likely to be around 500\\~600%. It's hard to find reliable data, but if you just look at the volume and price action, it's obvious that the shorts have only INCREASED since January 28th, not decreased. It is mathematically IMPOSSABLE for the shorts to have covered. It simply doesn't add up.\n\n# How the Gamma squeeze will trigger the short squeeze\n\nSome people doubt this could reach $10k or even $100k, just as people doubted it could reach $1000s. But here is why those numbers are not only likely, but MATHEMATICALLY INEVITABLE. (I'm not an expert to so take it FWIW, feel free to call me an idiot, but if I'm right, I'll expect apologies).\n\nFirst, let's look at the option interest (source: [https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/market-activity\/stocks\/gme\/option-chain](https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/market-activity\/stocks\/gme\/option-chain))\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Strike|Open interest March 12th|Open interest 19th|Shares (combined 12+19)|Shares (combined 12+19 cummulative)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|250|3231|2842|607,300|607,300|\n|255|563|0|56,300|663,300|\n|260|1047|542|158,900|822,500|\n|265|303|0|30,300|852,800|\n|270|788|748|153,600|1,006,400|\n|275|1386|0|138,600|1,145,000|\n|280|595|319|91,400|1,236,400|\n|285|303|0|30,300|1,266,700|\n|290|268|299|56,700|1,323,400|\n|295|323|0|32,300|1,355,700|\n|297.5|475|0|47,500|1,403,200|\n|300|7,011|5,389|1,240,000|2,643,200|\n|302.5|131|0|13,100|2,643,200|\n|305|276|0|27,600|2,683,900|\n|307.5|77|0|7,700|2,691,600|\n|310|660|307|96,700|2,788,300|\n|312.5|106|0|10,600|2,798,900|\n|315|683|0|68,300|2,867,200|\n|320|406|908|131,400|2,998,600|\n|325|313|0|31,300|3,029,900|\n|330|374|264|63,800|3,093,700|\n|332.5|130|0|13,000|3,106,700|\n|335|124|0|12,400|3,119,100|\n|337.5|48|0|4,800|3,123,900|\n|340|587|244|83,100|3,207,000|\n|345|622|0|62,200|3,269,200|\n|350|1876|2426|430,200|3,699,400|\n|355|122|0|12,200|3,711,600|\n|360|1151|344|149,500|3,861,100|\n|365|78|0|7,800|3,868,900|\n|370|103|351|45,400|3,914,300|\n|375|106|0|10,600|3,924,900|\n|380|290|396|68,600|3,993,500|\n|385|112|0|11,200|4,004,700|\n|390|354|508|86,200|4,090,900|\n|395|223|0|22,300|4,113,200|\n|400|3527|5156|868,300|4,981,500|\n|405|189|0|18,900|5,000,400|\n|410|173|258|43,100|5,043,500|\n|\ud83c\udf3f\u2697\ufe0f|605|1246|185,100|5,228,600|\n|430|211|130|34,100|5,262,700|\n|440|176|176|35,200|5,297,900|\n|450|558|604|116,200|5,414,100|\n|460|276|129|40,500|5,454,600|\n|470|215|210|42,500|5,497,100|\n|480|156|323|47,900|5,545,000|\n|490|166|314|48,000|5,593,000|\n|500|3,149|7,122|1,027,100|6,620,100|\n|510|259|496|75,500|6,695,600|\n|520|393|714|110,700|6,806,300|\n|530|252|168|42,000|6,848,300|\n|540|129|161|29,000|6,877,300|\n|550|490|1557|204,700|7,082,000|\n|560|198|218|41,600|7,123,600|\n|570|305|194|49,900|7,173,500|\n|580|94|615|70,900|7,244,400|\n|590|87|272|35,900|7,280,300|\n|600|1715|2065|378,000|7,658,300|\n|610|99|180|27,900|7,686,200|\n|620|117|153|27,000|7,713,200|\n|630|98|112|21,000|7,713,200|\n|640|326|250|57,600|7,791,800|\n|650|464|456|92,000|7,883,800|\n|660|320|147|46,700|7,930,500|\n|680|198|289|48,700|7,979,200|\n|700|1189|1264|245,300|8,224,500|\n|720|210|299|50,900|8,224,500|\n|740|307|239|54,600|8,330,000|\n|760|659|358|101,700|8,431,700|\n|780|1936|1060|299,600|8,731,300|\n|800|22,244|27,686|4,993,000|13,724,000|\n\nNow, it's important to mention that the MMs will try to stay delta-neutral. In other words, they will start buying BEFORE the price hits strike price. When the MMs sold $800 strike options while the price was at $40, they calculated it would be a 1 in a million chance or something really low that GME would hit $800 by march 12th. However, now, that chance is approaching 1% and climbing. The MMs still don't need to cover fully, but they are starting to consider the CHANCE of it happening is becoming more and more likely. So for each option (remember each option is 100 shares) they may be already buying 1 share per option for the 1% chance of it happening. But this very act may CAUSE it to happen.\n\nAt some point, this is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Because MMs are 'insuring' their bets by buying shares just in case the price goes up, the price actually goes up, which means they need to insure even more, which creates a snowball effect. All the way up to, or beyond, the last option, which is at strike price $800.\n\nSimilarly, the MMs probably considered it about maybe 5% likely that GME would hit 300 this week, but now it's more like 95% like, which means for each option contract with STRIKE 300, they will be buying 90 shares BEFORE the price hits 300 (which means about a million shares bought, which may actually cause the price to reach 300 in the first place!) They do this because they will be worse off when they have to buy in AFTER the price reached PAST 300 (then they will DEFINITLY make a loss). At least if they buy in BEFORE the price reaches $300, they can still make a profit or at least cut their losses.\n\nRemember, all parties are TRYING to make money, but not all of them succeed. So MMs are the ones driving the rally you have seen for the past few days, and looking at the above table, this will likely push the price towards, and likely over $800 either this week, or next week.\n\nYou can also see in some particular numbers there's a LOT of shares that need to be covered, expect a lot of action when we APPROACH those numbers (for example, $300, $350, $400, $420, $500 and of course $800) as you can see, some of those numbers are close, and a gamma squeeze looks inevitable at this point.\n\n# This is only the GAMMA SQUEEZE. Now what about the short squeeze?\n\nSome people ask: \"Why don't the shorts just wait for the rally to be over, and buy when the price drops back to normal levels?\" Simple answer: they can't. Melvin was already down 53% the last time and they didn't even cover (that was just a gamma squeeze, by their own words). When a hedge fund has a short position, they can keep that position, as long as they have enough other assets to cover themselves. If the price of the asset they are short increases drastically (like in the event of a gamma squeeze), they will be FORCED to buy. As an example, let's say Hedge Fund M has $100 billion worth of assets, and shorts Company G for $1 billion at $10 per share. Now the price goes to $1000 per share, so they need to cover $100 billion for their shorts. This is an unacceptable risk, as their shorts are now losing more money than their entire portfolio can cover. So they will be forced to liquidate their assets and buy the shares they shorted. However, this very act will drive up the price (if you want to know how, read up on order books and slippage, this post is getting long enough as it is).\n\nIn fact, this would usually happen long before they reach the point of bankruptcy, but seeing as Melvin managed to lose 53% and still didn't cover, it seems likely Melvin is too stubborn to cut their losses, and will ACTUALLY go bankrupt. This will leave the responsibility to cover with the clearing houses. The clearing houses are sure as hell not going to gamble (I'm pretty sure that's illegal). So the clearing houses would cover IMMEDIATLY, regardless of costs. Even if the feds literally has to print the money out of thin air. So TL;DR, it's a short squeeze because the shorts are FORCED to buy back their shorts, one way or another. Since they need to buy back hundreds of millions of shares (while only about 50 million or fewer are available) this will be \"name your price\" kind of prices. This is where $100k is NOT a meme.\n\n# IMPORTANT LAST POINT:\n\n**Don't lose hope when the squeeze does not happen this week or the next, there are still lots of other triggers that can happen in the near future. Remember, it doesn't cost us anything to HODL, but it does cost them a lot to SHORT. Every day they are losing MILLIONS. Every day we keep the price above $0 is a WIN for us.**\n\n~~Edit: those who still doubt $100k because it would make the market cap too high, DRYS went to $1.5 BILLION PER SHARE during a short squeeze. Let that sink in~~. That was a reverse stock split so not exactly relevant.",
        "957":"Why Gamestop is still undervalued today First we can take a quick walk through the history of how this all started, and explain how none of what's happening was \"our fault\". GameStop had, admittedly, followed a pretty outdated business model since the early 2010s. The gaming industry, like many others, was moving digital and Gamestop lagged far behind this trend.\n\nHedge funds, rightfully so to an extent, began shorting Gamestop in 2016. They began shorting it around $40 and rode the wave down. But they kept getting more and more greedy. Yadda yadda, sub-$4 and 140% short.\n\nDeep Fucking Value, Michael J Burry and others saw how undervalued Gamestop was at $4, and they started buying and HODLing shares. Just how undervalued were they when people started catching on in 2019\/2020? Well, at the end of 2019, Gamestop had about $1.6B in cash and about $800M in debt - or a net cash position of +$800M. The market cap of Gamestop was $276M when the share price was $4. Completely ignoring any future cash flows, you could purchase a share worth nearly $12 in cash for $4. *Hedge funds were still shorting the stock at this point.*\n\nSkip forward, Ryan Cohen becomes the catalyst that Sparks the shitkeg of short squeeze that hedge funds created, and off we went. Ryan Cohen, and his team, are the key. And what this thesis relies on **is already happening.**\n\nRyan Cohen and his team have begun taking over the board in what seems to be an amicable fashion. At least in the sense that it is not a hostile takeover. They've already ousted their dead weight CFO and have put in motion the new company vision to be an e-commerce retailer first, physical location game distributor second. That seems like a difficult transition to make...\n\nExcept Gamestop already has an online presence, already does e-commerce, has over 56 million subscribers to their online membership and increased their e-commerce sales by nearly 400% YoY **BEFORE Ryan Cohen became involved.**\n\nSo what's so special about Ryan Cohen? Well.. let's chew on that question for a second. *He turned a pet good company into a $30billion+ e-commerce giant.* Which gets us into the fundamentals. How does the market typically value e-commerce businesses? Many of them don't actually make a profit every year. They're valued based on future growth potential, usually based on a multiple of sales. Because e-commerce doesn't come with the overhead of physical retailers, investors will tolerate negative earnings in order to invest in rapid sustained growth, counting on them eventually becoming profitable.\n\nLet's start with Chewy. In 2020, they did $6.46B in revenue and -$174M in net income. They're trading at a market cap of almost $34B, which is just over five times their revenue. Seems fairly reasonable.\n\nLet's check in on our favorite gaming destination. In 2020, they did $5.16B in revenue and -$275M in net income. Not far off from Chewy, especially when you consider how much of Gamestop was still brick and mortar during a pandemic (oh and Chewy being fully e-commerce during a pandemic). GameStop, even after today, is trading at a market cap of $17B, which is just over three times revenue.\n\nSo two e-commerce companies. One built by Ryan Cohen, and one currently being led by Ryan Cohen. Trading at very different multiples. If we applied Chewys multiple to Gamestop, we would get a market cap of about $26B or a share price of about $377. That's a fair market value shareprice. **$377**. That does not consider a gamma or short squeeze at all. That is simply an efficient market pricing it as it should be valued.\n\nLet's check some other e-commerce companies to make sure we are being reasonable.\n\n- EBAY trades at a multiple of 3.72 times revenue\n- ETSY trades at a multiple of 15.11 times revenue\n- PINS trades at a multiple of 23.20 times revenue\n- AMZN trades at a multiple of 4.00 times revenue\n\nThere are clearly outliers, on the high side. Industry norms are typically 3-5x revenue for established businesses. When you anticipate strong near-term growth, as in the case of ETSY and PINS, you can see significantly higher multiples.\n\nUsing these valuations, we can confidently say that Gamestop is currently flirting with the low end of fair value, and has about 40% upside if we view them as an established business without extraordinary growth expectations. Except. We kind of do expect them to grow.\n\nHave I mentioned that nobody is considering their access to the e-gaming industry? Becoming a sponsor, or even facilitator of e-sporting events. Leagues, championships, etc. E-sports is a global industry that currently sees about $1B in revenue annually. This is expected to grow exponentially over the next decade, with most projections putting growth at 50-60% within the next two years, and continuing beyond that. Gamestop already has a Gamestop Performance Center, which is essentially a venue used for hosting major e-sporting events, as well as a host for training facilities. They've already tapped the market before Ryan Cohen, and his team will be able to truly capitalize on the market.\n\nThen we have live streaming, and potential acquisitions. At some point, it's likely that they will do an offering to raise capital. Spoiler, they don't currently need capital, but could deploy equity capital toward specific initiatives. Like purchasing an established platform to distribute electronic game downloads. Or purchase an established platform for live streaming. These initiatives don't have to be through acquisitions, but if they choose to, they will be able to afford to.\n\nOh yeah, PC gaming as well. It's been confirmed by several here and elsewhere that Gamestop is adding a feature to many of their stores. A \"Build-A-PC\" workstation. You can buy parts and build your PC in the store. The PC gaming industry is currently $38billion annually. It's expected to grow another 10% in the next few years. Another industry with rapid growth potential that Gamestop has already tapped into.\n\nWhat does this all mean? It means that if we consider Gamestop to be an e-commerce retailer with modest growth potential, the fair market value is somewhere between $230-385 a share. If we got wild and said they had the growth potential of something like ETSY, they would be worth $1,121 per share. I'd say they have room for more than modest growth, but not quite the potential of ETSY. Let's use about 5.6 as a multiple which would give us a **fair market value of $420 per share.**\n\n#Tl;dr: Based on Gamestops full commitment to being an e-commerce retailer, the fair market value of the company is between $15-26billion, or a share price of $230-385.\n\nBy the way, this is completely ignoring the fact that we are in the midst of repeated small gamma squeezes and a looming mother of all short squeezes. As a long term investment, Gamestop has the potential to be trading close to and above $400 per share. That is if the market is truly efficient and values Gamestop **based on fundamentals and no outside factors.**\n\nIf interested, I also did a rough analysis earlier on what the potential outstanding cost to fulfill call options are: [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/m1kvmx\/cost_of_shares_to_fulfill_open_call_options\/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=mweb)\n\n*This DD is based on information publicly available and my own interpretation of that information.

        "959":"A refresher on what the $#@! is going on with GME A lot of you may be new here, or maybe you've been here for a long time.\n\nBut either way, I'd like to bet that aside from knowing that \"hedge funds and shorters got too greedy and we're going to get them for it!\", **you don't really have any idea how the GME rocket started.**\n\nSo let me do the honours of giving you all a quick run-down on what is currently happening with GME.\n\n# It all started when hedge funds and shorters shorted GME into oblivion.\n\nWith COVID-19 impacting the world the way it did, GameStop was set to become the next Blockbuster and go out of business for good.\n\nHedge funds, who love to make money off shorting companies into bankruptcy, saw this as a perfect opportunity to make some easy money by **shorting more shares of GameStop than there were actual GameStop shares.**\n\nWhile some were able to figure this out before anyone else, pointing this out would have meant nothing if there was no reason for GME to go up...\n\n# Then all of a sudden GME had reasons to go up.\n\nPeople like Michael Burry and Keith \"Roaring Kitty\" Gill pointed out that the fundamentals for GME at the time (mid-2020) were not reflected accurately in GME's current price ($3-4 USD). What Michael Burry found out, in particular, was that not a single GameStop was in the red; they were all making profit to some degree.\n\nAfter GME starting showing positive trends, people like Ryan Cohen and companies like Microsoft invested in the company as well. With these investors in the company, there was hope for GameStop to not go bankrupt and actually adapt with the rise of eCommerce.\n\nFinally, to really help GME go along, Microsoft and Sony announced that their latest consoles (the XBOX One X and PS5) were still going to support physical disc copies of games. This further gave reason to believe that full-digital wasn't the future just yet, and that there was still hope and profit to be had in physical products\/locations.\n\n# And as GME started going up to most people's surprise, people started noticing how screwed shorters suddenly were...\n\nBut before we continue, I need to briefly explain what a *\"short squeeze\"* and *\"gamma squeeze\"* is. **If you already know, you can skip below.**\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**A \"short squeeze\" is when lots of people \"short\" shares, yet the price of the stock they shorted continues to go up, and eventually they're forced to cover their positions.**\n\n**This allows those with shares to sell the shares back to them at ridiculously high prices because, well, they have to buy them back.**\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**A \"gamma squeeze\" happens when many people make lots of  \"call\" options with market makers for prices that are very high to reach (ex. a $100 call for a stock worth $10).**\n\n**They do this in hopes that not only will the stock attain that set price or higher, but more importantly that the market makers don't actually have the shares to give to them if\/when the call options can be exercised.**\n\n**If this high volume of \"call\" options does get exercised, and market makers don't have the shares for them, that means that they'll be forced to buy the shares. Those with shares can then make them buy these required shares at much higher prices.**\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# SKIP POINT\n\n**People online began to communicate with one another about GME, and pointed out that is was going up despite what shorters wanted to happen.**\n\n# It was then that they theorized that with all the shares being shorted, and with the stock continuing to go up, that they could buy lots of GME shares and create many highly priced call options to create a short squeeze as well as numerous gamma squeezes.\n\n# But they weren't going to accomplish this alone...\n\n**Other big players on Wall Street also saw what GME was capable of, and provided the high volume required to send GME to the moon. And they provided the high volume indeed...**\n\n# And thus began the GME Gamma Squeeze of January 2021\n\nWhat was once a $3-4\/share company destined for bankruptcy suddenly sky-rocketed to a max of $480+ essentially overnight, and shorters and bears suddenly found themselves in billions worth of losses.\n\n# But we all know that big guys don't play nice.\n\nBefore more call options could be filled and the price of GME could go up any further, numerous brokers halted buying GME all together. This gave plenty of time for numerous \"call\" options to become worthless, and for shorters to regroup and recover their losses.\n\nAfter all, the DTCC gives a 21 day grace period for investors in huge debt to cover their positions, so these shorters were going to do everything they could within these 21 days to get the price of GME back down. This way, they could not only minimize their losses, but even get back into the green and continue to bankrupt GameStop.\n\nIn less than a month, GME plummeted to $40\/share, and all seemed lost. Hedge funds would win once again, and retail traders were given a grim reminder that they don't play by the same rules as the big players...\n\n# Yet this is not how GME ends.\n\nJust a few weeks ago, more hope was given that GME would rocket once again.\n\nKeith \"Roaring Kitty\" Gill proved that not only did he still hold all his original shares in GME, he also doubled down on his position right after he announced that he would still buy GME during a Congress Hearing.\n\nDuring the same Congress Hearing, Melvin Capital (a hedge fund that lost 53% of its value because of the GME Gamma Squeeze) admitted that there was no short squeeze, and that the rise of GME to $400+ was a result of a gamma squeeze.\n\n**In other words, a \"short squeeze\" hasn't happened yet.**\n\nPeople found that shorts theoretically didn't all cover as shorters continued to be greedy and likely held on to their shorts as they thought they could still bankrupt GME like they originally planned.\n\nThey found that while short interest was seemingly much lower that there were still very few GME shares left to short and that shorters were still losing millions every time GME spiked to new level highs.\n\nNot only that, but that shorters likely continued to short as GME went down during the gamma squeeze; putting them in an even bigger short position than the last.\n\nRyan Cohen made it official that he would be heading GameStop's eCommerce division (because of course he is)...\n\nThere were meme tweets of ice cream, frogs, and 1980-90's games\/movies...\n\nPeople began exercising call options once more, and now...\n\n# The GME rocket rises once again...\n\n# TL;DR: Shorters and Market Makers are currently in desperate positions where they need A LOT of shares of GME to cover their shorts and fulfill their \"call\" options, and retail investors (but most importantly big players) are buying and holding all the shares they can to make GME the Big Squeeze of the 21st Century.\n\n# NONE OF THIS IS FINANCIAL ADVICE, AND PURELY FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES.

        "964":"The Systematic Risk in the Financial System GME revealed This is a continuation of a DDDD I wrote a few weeks ago about [how GME could cause a stock market crash](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/l9sh9e\/dddd_why_gme_might_next_week_and_how_it_could\/) through mass de-grossing from short\/long Hedge Funds. However, that was just one side of the story, and there was an even more troubling 2008-style flaw in the system the GME has revealed in our financial system; something that first interested me when Thomas Peterffy, the founder and chairman of Interactive Brokers mentioned it on CNBC.\n\n*Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion and for ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up and with some satire thrown in. Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*\n\nFirst, let\u2019s go on a history lesson about the 2008 Financial Crisis and one of the main factors in it - Counterparty Risk.\n\n# What is Counterparty Risk?\n\nCounterparty Risk is the likelihood that the counterparty (i.e. entity on the other side) of the transaction might default on an obligation. To put it simply, imagine Bob sells Alice one GME call with a $10 strike price. Unfortunately for Bob, some \ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d in an obscure subreddit sent GME \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf1d so when those calls expire, GME is at $410, meaning Bob now owes Alice $40K. However, Bob\u2019s entire portfolio is worth only $10K and is unable to fulfil his financial obligation when he wrote those GME calls, defaulting on it.\n\n# Counterparty Risk in 2008 & the \u201cSolution\u201d\n\nThis is exactly what happened in the 2008 Financial Crisis when AIG sold Credit Default Swaps (basically, puts on the housing market) and defaulted on their financial obligations when the housing market collapsed. It made everything worse, because other funds were using these CDS to hedge their own positions in the housing market, so when those CDS turned out to be worthless because the other side was bankrupt, it endangered the financial soundness of firms like Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, BoA and Marril Lynch who bought these swaps. This suddenly created a counterparty risk to anyone on the other sides of all the trades they have made, and has a domino effect that ends up with basically every financial institution collapsing if AIG collapses; in other words, AIG was too big to fail.\n\nTitle 7 of Dodd Frank, which was the law passed by Congress as a response to the Financial Crisis to prevent this from ever happening again, mandates that all securities and derivatives be cleared in clearing houses such as DTCC and post collateral they deem to be sufficient to manage counterparty risk to them. These clearing houses would then be responsible for ensuring a transaction is fulfilled on both sides, and if one of the parties in the transactions fail to meet their obligation, they are responsible for honoring it.\n\n# Why this doesn\u2019t really work\n\nWhat this solution has effectively created is one monolithic central counterparty in the form of the DTCC. According to their [2019 annual report](https:\/\/www.dtcc.com\/annuals\/2019\/financial-performance\/), they processed $2.15 quadrillion worth of securities in 2019, or 24 times the global GDP of $24T and 6 times the total net worth of the world of $360T. Basically, they\u2019re way too big to fail. So to make sure this never happens, they have pretty broad authority to unilaterally decide how much collateral each participant based on their outstanding trades using an unknown and obscure formula.\n\nThis is how Robinhood got fucked over by them - their collateral requirements for the DTCC suddenly increased ten-fold on them, and they had a liquidity crisis (which they tried really hard not to admit, because this is the brokerage equivalent of your bank saying they're running out of cash and you might not get your deposits back) because they didn\u2019t have enough cash to cover it. What happens if a participant can\u2019t meet their collateral requirements? Similar to a degenerate options gambler who can\u2019t meet their margin call (aka your average [r\/wallstreetbets](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/) \ud83e\udd8d), their entire portfolio gets liquidated.\n\nSee, DTCC not only is a central clearing house that guarantees most settlements; technically that\u2019s the NSCC, which is a subsidiary \/ service provided by the DTCC. Their main operations are the equivalent of a central bank for brokerages - the broker of brokers, responsible for holding the physical shares that the brokerages own; hence their name Depository Trust Clearing Corporation.\n\nSo what does it take to bring the DTCC down? Most recently, GME. For those who haven\u2019t seen it yet, this interview with the Chairman of Interactive Brokers (apparently post gets auto-deleted if I put a YouTube link, but should be easy to find) on why they halted buying of GME outlines the issue pretty clearly. For those with too short of an attention span to click the link, he basically says\n\n* The most important reason why he halted GME purchases was to protect the integrity of the financial system and clearing houses\n* There were ALOT of options that suddenly became in the money, and whoever held them suddenly were owed a bucket of tendies; he mentioned $10-15B losses in one expiry date alone.\n* These tendies need to come from somewhere. Anyone who was net short GME got absolutely fucked and might defaulting on their short position or call option write.\n* If they default, the broker is on the hook to pay out those losses. If the broker cannot pay for it, they go under and clearing house (DTCC) is on the hook\n\n# Tin Foil Hat Time\n\nNow here\u2019s where I\u2019ll start speculating on what exactly happened on the other side of the trade and DTCC. So, who\u2019s on the other side of all these GME calls, or in other words, who wrote all these calls and suddenly owes fuck ton of money when GME \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf1d? Probably Citadel, which is involved in [over 99% of all options trading volume](https:\/\/www.citadelsecurities.com\/products\/equities-and-options\/). Now in theory, Market Makers are not in the business of taking a position and should be delta-neutral in all positions they take.\n\nHowever, delta and gamma hedging is a tricky art and probably not possible to perfect, especially in situations where a ticker suddenly becomes irrationally volatile, has large gaps between sessions (i.e. the opening price is significantly above or below the previous closing) and when the underlying is illiquid relative to the notional exposure value. I\u2019m too lazy to actually research this data, although I\u2019m almost certain this is true (someone pls fact check me), but it\u2019s extremely likely that at a certain point, the amount of shares Citadel needed to buy to remain fully delta hedged on all the options they wrote exceeded the available float, and became literally impossible to do.\n\nThis is because a large portion of the options they wrote were out-of-the-money, meaning that although they don\u2019t need to buy a lot of GME shares when they first sell the contract to be delta-hedged, they would need to drastically purchase more and more shares if GME goes up, causing it to go up even more and becoming a vicious cycle (i.e. gamma squeeze). Usually, market makers might use other strategies like buying similar tickers or ETFs holding GME to try to remain delta neutral, but there\u2019s so much volatility that it\u2019s possible that Citadel was in fact net delta-negative on GME - on in other words, they lost money if GME goes up.\n\nOkay, so let\u2019s make a logical jump (with no evidence) to speculate an idea - what if **Citadel\u2019s financial soundness came into question?** In other words, what if they were at risk of bankruptcy and ended up defaulting on their financial obligations? Well, they\u2019re involved with over 99% of all options trades, and if they default then the DTCC is suddenly on the hook for unwinding their massive portfolio and ensuring that all of Citadel\u2019s financial obligations, including paying out all those GME calls, are met.\n\nObviously, DTCC does not want this to happen, and as a private corporation, they are allowed to do whatever is in their best financial interest to preserve their own financial soundness to ensure their business is not at risk that is allowed within the financial regulatory framework they operate in - including raising GME margin requirements.\n\n*TLDR; DTCC is definitely too big to fail, so they get broad sweeping powers by financial regulation to make sure they don't fail. Citadel is probably too big to fail in DTCC's eyes because they don't want to be responsible for honoring 99% of all options transactions.*",

The trajectory of GME's ascent this time feels different from the previous time, little volume on most days, less volatility than before, a much lower interest rate on borrowing to short.\n\nApart from the possibility that a) the HFs have given up, or b) the shorts have already been squeezed (mostly) and retail is actually just bidding up the stock against themselves while thinking that the HFs are on the other side (fairly large daily volume makes that less likely, but you never know), what are some opinions on here about what the hedge-funds are up to? If they are still exposed to risk, they seem to be playing it differently this time.

The base idea behind his findings was that any short volume over 50% cannot be 100% covered that day... so he just thought - how much can these short boys actually cover, if all shorts opened were intended to be covered...\n\nHere's what he's worked out spoiler alert:>!shorts r more fuk than bears!<\n\n\"So, I have been freaking the fuck out about this.  I am of the belief that at one point, FINRA said the truth about SI%... Being 226% on the 15th of january.

Thus I made MinimalCost of OFF-Exchange as (OEV \\* $40).\n\nIf they covered through Long Volume on market, then we'd be able to estimate that CONSERVATIVELY by comparing the days low to the Daily long volume (Day's Low \\* LV).\n\nThen came to the conclusion of the data:\n\nI wrote down the FINVIZ float, the SI% from FINRA, and derived the Short Volume at the time. THEN, I made 3 tables:\n\n* Table 1: Shows how many Shorts are there at different intervals of covering on Off-market and On-market.\n* Table 2: Shows the cost of doing those coverings.\n* Table 3: Shows the new SI%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/d05jq0jx31m61.png?width=1806&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b1309f6e677e016ba1dbc04208dc8eb0b4ed665\n\nIN CONCLUSION:   Using My data, I was able to derive that the **535.9% SI%** being passed around would cost Short Sellers 25 BILLION DOLLARS theoretically.\n\nThe **Maximum SI% can be rn is 942.06%.**\n\nIt is **litterally impossible for it to be under 200% rn** as it would be too costly.\n\nI believe that SI% is over 600%, as I believe that certain companies ran while they could, spending 10 billion dollars AT MOST between them all for covering.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/zyzechcy31m61.png?width=1275&format=png&auto=webp&s=e79ea03302ad64646162736f3f9a39843cc484fe\n\nBecause you cannot justify over 20% of long volume transfers being covering, its mostly algos and day traders as for calls, I just dont see that going over 30% as its abundantly clear calls are being used against them, not for them. and even that is pushing it.\n\nMy point for my want is this: I**t is impossible that SI% is not more than 226%** as was said on the 15th as the costs would be to great and the data is just not there to support it but instead I came to the conclusion that we are way fucking past that for simmilar reasons\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/bfuqksue31m61.png?width=1448&format=png&auto=webp&s=3db05997bf1b3d2c6b909b8994888cab21464829\n\nNOTE: NONE OF THIS EVEN TAKES INTEREST INTO ACCOUNT FOR THEIR COSTS, IT IS ALL JUST THEORETICAL COVERING COSTS ALONE.

If you buy a stock - hold onto it, even if you have a loss.\n\n2 - Being impatientThis directly correlates with the one above. I barely had any patience and trust in $GME - which is understandable, there is a lot of movement, but the most gains were done using patience.\n\n3 - Not informing myself when to get in our outI always noticed a lot of fluctiation around popularity. When $GME was less reported (for example, in news and generally less activity) it started falling, quite a lot. Especially once the news make fun of us apes for having losses.\n\n4 - Not checking out wsb (Not looking at who you're with)  \nThe most motivating thing in this entire short squeeze was looking at this sub.

        "975":"$GME DD : Technical Analysis shows Very Strong Buy Signals #  Intro\n\nWelcome, and I hope everyone is fresh for a new day of holding because things seem to be getting interesting now. My take on this DD is a bit different to my usual format as I've decided to focus on the Technical analysis side of GME this time around. Why? Because you apes couldn't contemplate words so now I'm using colourful crayons and pictures instead. As always, I've inserted a TLDR for the autists but I do recommend reading it since it'll also help grow your knowledge of TA.\n\n# Pivot Point\n\nThe pivot **point, support and resistance calculations are widely accepted as the simplest yet most effective trading strategy.** They are well trusted by traders, banks and all financial institutions as clear indicators of the strength or weakness of the market. *They are used as the basis for most technical analysis*. **The pivot point is the point in which the market sentiment changes from bearish to bullish.**\n\nFor example, let's look at the candlestick chart for a ticker that I took from tradingview,\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Example Candlestick Chart](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/cdv56c1km0m61.jpg?width=873&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=83757b1f0769e06ca5f27ffeb1da8ac08bbe8601)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nR1 = (2 x Pivot Point) \u2013 Daily Low\n\nR2 = Pivot Point + (Daily High \u2013 Daily Low)\n\nS1 = (2 x Pivot Point) \u2013 Daily High\n\nS2 = Pivot Point \u2013 (Daily High \u2013 Daily Low)\n\n*R3 = Daily High + 2 x (Pivot Point \u2013 Daily Low)*\n\n*S3 = Daily Low \u2013 2 x (Daily High \u2013 Pivot Point)*\n\n**LINKING BACK TO GME**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Pivot Point Data were taken from Investing.com](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/rbjrco9nm0m61.jpg?width=976&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3f917346de8cdbbc3f5e333edb8b6073831cd1a9)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGME-\n\nResistance Line 1: $195.13\n\nResistance Line 2: 202.33\n\nResistance Line 3: 215.87\n\n*While writing this post $GME was hovering around $217* in pre-market (Which is higher than the current R3 value), all though the value is bound to change before the market opens, if $215 can be maintained during the opening; that **will ultimately see Resistance Level 3 becoming the new support line. This would depict a very strong bullish trend that can be aided by the RSI (Relative strength index)**\n\n*You can ignore the Fibonacci, camarilla etc PP if you're new to TA but they basically show the same trend of the ticker having an uptrend.*\n\n# Relative Strength Index\n\n*The relative strength index (RSI) is a* *momentum indicator* *used in technical analysis that measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions* in the price of a stock or other asset. The RSI is displayed as an oscillator (a line graph that moves between two extremes) and can have a reading from 0 to 100\n\nRSI below 30: Oversold, will rebound and may show divergence\n\nAbove 70: Overbought\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[GME RSI between march 4th and 8th](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/7ropbgzsm0m61.jpg?width=1201&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2c7ae49ff044332e81020f8404647aa973073a99)\n\nCurrent GME RSI value: 68 (Neutral)\n\n*The data shows RSI value continuing in an uptrend (bullish) and is in line with the price of $GME as no divergence could be seen. Coupling it with the pivot points, if the same trend continues today and tomorrow we'll see a breakout and support lines forming around $215+*\n\n**Disclaimer: My predictions are just me speculating and do not necessarily mean they are right. The increased volatility with low float means the price could go in any directions. But the indicators seem to be showing a healthy direction for a bullish market.**\n\n**Now comparing this to the RSI before January squeeze:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[RSI before jan squeeze](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/8otntoxum0m61.jpg?width=455&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fda45bc0fd98a78cea2e04d90c88ed9187a36d91)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRSI Value: 72.14\n\nAs seen from the second image, RSI trend before the breakout was in an uptrend. However, the slope was not as steep as we're currently seeing right now and when the price really started getting high, RSI showed a massive overbought. Comparing this back to the march RSI, that trend is still in the neutral territory and has potential for a more violent uptick as RSI value reaches the 70-75+ region.\n\n# Volume Weighted Average Price\n\nThe volume-weighted average price (VWAP) is a trading benchmark used by traders that gives the average price security has traded throughout the day, based on both volume and price.\u00a0*It is important because it provides traders with insight into both the trend and value of security.* Large institutional buyers and mutual funds use the VWAP ratio to help move into or out of stocks with as small of a market impact as possible. Therefore, when possible, institutions will try to buy below the VWAP, or sell above it. **This way their actions push the price back toward the average, instead of away from it.**\n\n*VWAP calculates the sum of price multiplied by volume, divided by total volume.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[VWAP January 13th-22nd](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/jcps124xm0m61.jpg?width=131&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=67dbb4877f7fa69b17429839bfa967c605d2b08d)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[VWAP March 1st-8th](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/s2sqhq2ym0m61.jpg?width=324&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d2916f02390c863ea8b815eaca847d618766f51e)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Blue Line indicates the volume-weighted average price. **Comparing both pictures, the vwap value in regards to each candlestick seems to show the same pattern.**\n* VWAP has been above the average day trading price between 6 and 7th March, this seems to act like the support line for the price.\n* **8th march and 22nd January show a similar pattern, both had a relatively significant increase in (=increased volatility and more violent price swings) as well as a positive slope gradient.**\n\n# Moving Average Convergence Divergence\n\nMACD is a trend-following [momentum](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/m\/momentum.asp) indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security\u2019s price. The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-period [exponential moving average](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/e\/ema.asp) (EMA) from the 12-period EMA. A nine-day EMA of the MACD called the \"signal line,\" is then plotted on top of the MACD line, which can function as a trigger for buy and sell signals. **Traders may buy the security when the MACD crosses above its signal line.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[MACD january](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/akhuo1g1n0m61.jpg?width=311&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=32ae04bfcde02eb35d592de58a87f48053cda122)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[MACD march](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/l0cu7ez2n0m61.jpg?width=553&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5b836600d1bb2bac2c97aa6a10a97607381532f8)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMACD is often displayed with a histogram (see the chart below) which graphs the distance between the MACD and its signal line. If the MACD is above the signal line, the histogram will be above the MACD\u2019s baseline.\n\n* **MACD in January showed a gradual increase till breakout, the march macd value is much stronger in regards to the trend and can see the signal line deviating away from the EM**A. Linking it back to the RSI uptrend, trend seems to be bullish and does not show any signs of divergence. *Outcome? Will probably continue this trend for the days to come*\n\n# Other Indicators\n\nSince I ran out of time and probably you apes have ran out of patience as well, I'm just going to list the other moving averages indications to summarise the trends.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Indicator Values taken from trading view](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/dt8dgbo4n0m61.jpg?width=663&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=178b8def7cf54223bb626d78f7be1187159e0bd4)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# TLDR\n\n**Most (If not all) Moving average indicators show a very strong bullish market on a DAY scale as we can see the trend to continue to follow an uptrend. The Resistance level 3 pivot points may become the new support live if the RSI+MACD trend continues. Neither show divergence which is also a good sign.**\n\nAnyways hope I've cleared some things out, and if the DD needs correction then please feel free to let me know so i can fix\/include the data. **This is my last DD to the series and hope it has benefited people, I'll be taking some time off now to snort coke,** ***bon voyage*** **apes!**\n\n\\*Disclaimer: I'm not a financial advisor, nor am I giving financial advice.

I bought a few more shares as it went down, but I was honestly wondering if I\u2019d made a huge mistake and just wasted my money on a dumb meme.

For background, I work in one of the major finance companies, not on finance but with machine learning\/time series prediction, but I've lots of meetings with lots of people, and people talk. I can't give away too much info because it may cost my job, but the deep shit going on is over the charts, in 100 years this event will be spoken of.\n\n\nFirst of all, not all hedge funds shorted GME, this is important because of what is about to happen, some funds managers are actually selling the assholes of their wives and first born sons to banks to get loans, I'm speaking of exorbitant amounts, remember that 35% of the dollars ever printed were printed last year, guess who is going to get a big piece of that ? Why ? They want to be the bigger fish on the aquarium, WSB opened the door for few hedge funds to expand brutally by destroying others.\n\n\nMaybe people here didn't realize yet what they started, but it has epic proportions and you are living it right now. Second, big hedge funds are partnering up, but this is where comes the problem, imagine that you will try to rob a bank, what make you sure that the people that you partner with won't kill you to have less people to share the money with ? This is the current situation, this is the waiting, hedge funds, including the company that I work with are waiting for the money, and to see who they can trust. In the end they will all backstab each other, this is the finance industry, you can't deny it. Because soon as the price skyrocket to alpha centauri, guess who will be greedy to start another fucked up short ? Yes, the hedge funds, all over again, but is far easier to short at 750$, so is just a matter of who will short first. At work lots of people are absurdly greedy regarding shorting it, that was what created this opportunity, but some people never learn.\n\n\nThis is why you should hold, I'm holding just for fun and to see this shit show, if one day I sell, I will get the dollar bills and put in a frame in my wall, we are living the WW III of financial markets, now we are on the ships awaiting to arrive to the beach on a new D day, meanwhile some hedge funds are on our side (long, but don't think that they care about you as a person) coming with the atomic bombs. One risk that we escalated at work is that paper hands (as you like to call them) may sell leaving the other funds not vulnerable to a massive attack, rendering all this useless. Hold if you can, this is a game of patience, soon the direction will change, fucking huge buy orders will come and they will artificially inflate the price while other funds will have to think fast on get bankrup sooner, or be bankrupt later.\n\n\nCan't say much, but few funds already gave their CEOs and managers some quite fat bonuses, why ? This is the last song, last dance, they are looting the ship before it sinks. You have no reason to believe in me, I'm a random guy on the internet, but pay attention to the fucking events that are going on, and you will understand that this is much bigger than just making few bucks. If you put all of this together, you will see that the silence of operations (see the fucking low volume) means the silence before the storm.

What could possibly better for GameStop than creating life long, untold loyalty with all of us young, internet savvy investors? Plus all of the headlines, movies and the impact on pop culture. What an opportunity for Gamestop! I believe they have massive skin in the game and want to see this happen more than any of us. They are not going to throw a bone to Wall Street and fuck us over - can you imagine how well that would fare for their Cohen, his investment and their transition to online retailer?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is all speculation and I am not a financial advisor, just a crayon eating ape who LOVES the potential of GME at $180, 200 or $500.

        "983":"GME SQUEEZE DD FOLLOW UP - WHY IT COULD BE DIPPING THIS WEEK, WHY THIS WOULD BE A GOOD THING AND MORE ^(Disclaimer: No financial advise!)\n\nGood morning, good afternoon and good evening again my fellow retards around the world\n\nThis is a followup on my [previous post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/lzsnlk\/gme_squezze_dd_moon_soon_possibly\/), in which I already announced i would do one, if there are people actually reading my post. Hope you are still interested.\n\n**Some remarks relating to the feedback I received on my previous post:**\n\n1. You retards did what 12 years of school education couldnt: I finally can spell squeeze correctly.- Appreciate it.\n2. That is actually all concerning general remarks. Just wanted to thank you for No. 1 and also: Great comment by [u\/Calithrix](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/u\/Calithrix\/). I actually tried to consolidate(collateralize) some of the previous DDs on GME. But please dont be Bear Stearns and just buy it instead try to do your own DD.\n\n**Why it could be dipping this week and why this would be a good thing?**\n\nSo lets start by answering why it is a good thing, if it actually dips this week. If the price is lower **delta** of options is actually **lower**, because the delta of an option has a positive correlation with the probability of being ITM for call options and being OTM for put options. And if the price is lower the probability that an call option becoming ITM or an put option becoming OTM is lower. For more info on that I just can again refer to [u\/Natural\\_Profession\\_8](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/u\/Natural_Profession_8\/) [post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/lz8mgr\/a_deepdive_on_the_actual_math_behind_gamma\/).\n\nAnd a **lower delta** means less shares already hedged, meaning if the price goes up again all of a sudden, more shares needed to be bought. It is easier to get it up for whales when the price is low and thats why they could let the price intentionally drop this week.\n\nAlso a dip could mean shorts are getting FOMO and open new shorts (Thats what happened the previous 5 years and led to the high Short interest in the first place).\n\n**Some other requirements for a squeeze**\n\n* You need definitely a catalyst for any squeeze. Here are some possible dates:\n\n1. 03\/24 Earnings\n2. 03\/08 Stimmy checks (actually today lol)\n3. find other possible catalysts in [u\/HeyItsPixeL](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/u\/HeyItsPixeL\/) post. (couldnt link cause of WSB guidelines but just look at his Endgame post with a lot of Upvotes)\n\n* It is actually not that important that a certain price is reached, it is more important that its going up fast. Then Delta is moving fast and MMs need to hedge fast.\n* Thats also the reason why I dont thinks short are gonna play a huge role in the squeeze. They are not forced by their programs to buy GME unless they are margin called for which we actually need an incredibly huge price increase. I am talking prices in the thousands, which could be reached by a gamma squeeze but not solely because of a catalyst.\n\n**Some final thoughts**\n\n* You probably already noticed Im less bullish than other DDs on GME here. With the reason for that being, that I actually believe most of the official number. Yeah I could be wrong about that and there is actually a huge conspiracy behind all of that. And Yeah I know there happened some crazy things. But these are actually all easily explainable without needing a conspiracy theory: A lot of people liked the stock and bought it, this caused some rapid price movement, which was supported by some gamma squeeze. Then RobinHood and other brokers had liquidity problems because they needed to come up with a few billion dollars. But no one wants the public to know, that you have liquidity problems, so you come up with excuses. It all makes sense.\n* Some words on the emotionalization about the stock: WSB being the Good \ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d with \ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd32 who are fighting the evil hedgefunds, who want to short GME into insolvency. I also love the story. But I stop liking the story, when people are actually betting their student loans on that shit. Its not that funny anymore then. With that being said, I hope all of you, who betted your student loans on it, will laugh at me soon from your Teslas (Hopefully theyll have enough production capacities, even with GIGA Berlin its going to be tight\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80), but try to bet only money you can lose next time. There is no such thing as certainty in the stock market (otherwise we wouldnt be here but already at the Tesla store) but there is the possibility and thats all that matters. \ud83c\udf1a\n\n**TLDR: MOON POSSIBLE BUT PROBABLY NOT THIS WEEK**",

So I started doing research on the company and they just hit the market last year in August and has been doing well since so why was it shorted so much? I for the most part just passively observed it for a bit. Fast forward to it today and it is shorted only 6% so I look at the stock and it dropped from 25.89 to 23.35 with 2m volume in 3 days and it is no longer shorted. [https:\/\/finviz.com\/quote.ashx?t=UTZ](https:\/\/finviz.com\/quote.ashx?t=UTZ) \n\nSo now that the short is over, I wondered if it is a good time to invest in it (my money is tied up in GME but if I had funds available) so I went to the call options to see what they had going on there and I found 7,347 call options for $30 a share as well as 1,092 @$25  \n\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/dxmqtgzl1ql61.png?width=985&format=png&auto=webp&s=25323fe4352551c8c05f4a8131e4573c24b80452\n\nso I think this is not a guarantee but I think it would be a good safe investment with almost immediate returns. plus there isn't too much risk because this company has been doing very well since it hit the market. \n\nThanks fellow apes, also GME \\*rocket noises\\* to the \\*monkey noises\\* moon",

TL\/DR: Forbes can suck it. This is my rant. NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE\n\n   \n \n\nI've reconsidered the Forbes article that came out Friday. The more I think about it, the more pissed I've become about the subtle, manipulative, and just plain evil condescension.\n\n   \n \n\nThe writer sounded like they were writing a piece complimenting retail investors on our astute comprehension of the numbers. Basically said the little GME investors were NOT just the ignorant peasants that many experts are trying to portray.\n\n\nSOUNDS GOOD,  RIGHT?\n\n\n\nWell, it was just another headfake, y'all. The writer was framing US (retail investors) as the Goliath, not as the underdog, as the David fighting AGAINST the Goliath.\n\n   \n \n\nIts disgusting. These media shills, including FORBES, are just spewing their own GME panic propaganda. And all the so called 'experts' that say retail investors are 'colluding together' have lost their souls.\n\n   \n \n\nWhen corrupt leaders at Big Hedgies break the law, and swindle the whole world out of their hard earned dollars...when THEY actually collude to destroy companies, and drive down their stock into bankruptcy for their own profit.....guess what. Crickets.\n\n   \n \n\nNOBODY says or does anything about it. Not the media, not the SEC, not the FBI, not the DTCC, an definitely not Congress. The ONLY reason anyone is 'looking' at it, is because us regular people are now AWAKE to the manipulations and the corruption in every segment of our government and financial sectors. They have to 'look like' they are interested in holding somebody accountable. But they aren't really going after the hedgies. They are going after YOU. ME. DFV. Anyone who dares pull back the curtain.\n\n   \n \n\nBut when regular people see a good opportunity, and want to invest, LEGALLY, they lose their shit.\n\n   \n \n\nI don't know ANY of you. I don't take advice from anyone here. I read and research and then make my own decisions.\n\n   \n \n\nBut dammit, I see a good opportunity, so I've jumped in the deep end of the pool. I've jumped on the proverbial train. And I will ride it to the end of the line.\n\n   \n \n\nI'm gonna be honest, I'm just tired. I'm tired of living on the edge of broke for years.\n\nI just want to be able to finally get my kid braces. To buy myself my good vehicle, or at least fix the one we have. It has 148K miles and is definitely dont feel safe to travel on roadtrips. I dont even like to drive across Houston, just in case the engine light goes on again.\n\n   \n \n\nMy credit is not great, so I cant finance a car. (Don't say it. I've already tried. Twice in 18 months. Every time I try again, it tanks my credit further) And since I'm self employed, I don't have a JOB that pays me a regular paycheck. Therefore the \"Your job is your credit\" financing isnt an option either. So YA, Momma wants a car.\n\n   \n \n\nI want to take a family vacation. Hell I want to take a weekend with my husband every once in a while.\n\n   \n \n\nI want to do fun things, and important things like help my kids go to college, IF they want to.\n\n   \n \n\nI want to be able to give a $100 tip to the struggling server, or even provide a fabulous Christmas for some family in need.\n\n   \n \n\nIf this makes me a greedy Bitch, I guess I'm a greedy bitch.\n\n   \n \n\nBut it DOESNT make me a criminal. It DOESNT mean I am 'scheming' to manipulate the stock market. OR that I am part of a \"premeditated, predatory take-down of a cornered and defenseless counterparty.\" as FORBES claims. ell, WE are the cornered, defenseless counterparty, NOT the multi BILLION DOLLAR Hedge funds!\n\n   \n \n\nAre you friggin' KIDDING ME??? My shares, and even ALL the shares we hold as retail investors do NOT have the power to MOVE the market. The BIG institutions are the ones with the power to actually tank the stock or lift the price.\n\n   \n \n\nWE, the reddit investors, are just little ants on a log; riding the roaring waters of the market, hanging on for dear life! And if we HANG ON, then we can make it to the end of this crazy ride, safe and DRY.\n\n   \n \n\nWe SEE the end of the journey and are willing to take that journey. Who are these people to say that we are greedy for just jumping on board and risking our money, even maybe our lives, to arrive at the end of that beautiful run?\n\n   \n \n\nWho are they to say we are greedy for just tagging along, for playing THEIR game, the RIGHT way?\n\nTruth is, these hedge funds hold the investments of millions of innocent investors in their hands. And THEY are the ones who have risked these people's fortunes, their very LIVES, playing a rigged game. THEIR greed and corruption has been revealed.\n\n   \n \n\nAnd I'm sorry if they are freaking out. But its just what happens when you GET CAUGHT.\n\n   \n \n\nTO BE CLEAR: My goal is not to crash the market or to destroy hedge funds, even tho I think some people should go to jail for their illegal activities.\n\n   \n \n\nI just want to ride the rapids.

        "986":"GME SQUEZZE DD MOON SOON (possibly) Good morning, good afternoon and good evening my fellow retards around the world.\n\nI know many of you are more like [this](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/k77i69\/wsb_reading_citron_reports\/) if it comes to reading DDs. But I wanted to explain a few things with the ultimate aim, that you dont need to do read any more DD but rather can do your own DD. As most of you cant read anyways, Ill put a TLDR with symbols at the bottom. So here we go.\n\n# General squezze theory (I know a lot of words but reading will make you a big brain \ud83e\udd8d)\n\nThere are two types of squezzes:\n\n* short squezze\n* gamma squezze\n\n**Short squezzes:**\n\nEvil Hedgefunds and MMs sell a stock, which they dont have, in hope they can buy it back cheaper. Now price goes up --> Hedgefunds have to cover to cut their losses. Otherwise there is the risk of unlimited loss, as stock price can go up infinitely. If they wait to long they get margin called, because their broker is in fear that they cant cover anymore. And no one wants to get [margin called](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/k9v5e9\/that_margin_call_notification_at_3am\/).\n\n**Gamma squezzes:**\n\nEvil MMs (and others) sell far OTM call options. Now price goes up and suddenly those options are ITM. MMs now have to buy the stock to cover their sold options making the price surge once again bringing new formely OTM options ITM, which then again leads to the price surging. This feedback loop is called a gamma squezze. For this to happen you need to have high numbers of OTM option sold at certain strike prices. Just enough, that the next strike price is reached. It is more likely that lower strike prices are reached. MMs know that, hence they have already hedged some of there sold OTM options with these lower strike prices. This is called Delta Hedging. That means you need higher number of OTM options with lower strike prices then of those with higher strike prices to keep the Squezze going.\n\nIf you want to go even deeper I suggest you look at u\/Natural_Profession_8 [post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/lz8mgr\/a_deepdive_on_the_actual_math_behind_gamma\/). He also did a formula, which you can use to calculate how to have the biggest leverage with option buying, meaning forcing MMs to buy the most shares with the purchase of option with a certain strike price.\n\nWhat you always need to keep in mind for both kinds of squezze that the price run up to trigger the squezze has to be rather fast. Otherwise, there is more time to cover shorts or hedge options and hence having less effect on the price.\n\n# Applying this to the current GME situation\n\n**Short squezze:**\n\nIm sorry to say that, but I dont think a squezze solely because of shorts covering will be happening any time soon. You have all seen how the short interest has dropped tremendously from the previous legendary 226%^(1) within the last to reporting dates to now 60%^(2).\n\n^(1: 01\/14\/21,) [^(Yahoo Finance)](https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/quote\/GME\/key-statistics?p=GME) ^(with Morningstar data, which suggests a Float of roughly 27M shares)\n\n^(2: 02\/11\/21,) [^(Yahoo Finance)](https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/quote\/GME\/key-statistics?p=GME) ^(with Morningstar data, which suggests a Float of roughly 27M shares)\n\n*\"But there was no volume?\".* Just look at the numbers. GME had a average Volume of 40.49M per day over the last three months. As a stock with roughly 70M shares outstanding thats a lot.^(3) AMZN had a 3 months average volume of 3.73M per day with roughly 7x the shares outstanding of GME.^(4) There was enough volume.\n\n^(3:)  [^(Yahoo Finance)](https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/quote\/GME\/key-statistics?p=GME)\n\n^(4:)  [^(Yahoo Finance)](https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/quote\/AMZN\/key-statistics?p=AMZN)\n\n*\"But what is with the institutional ownership?\"* You all probably all seen these posts, where its said \"Institutions solely hold xTimes Outstanding shares of GME. So there has to be massive short interest.\" (e. g. see [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/lz77ix\/gme_total_shares_owned_is_145m_according_to_finra\/)). But what most of these Posts are missing, that there often reporting delays in between ownership filing, which is causing these high numbers. If you compare it again to AMZN, you also have institutions owning 1.5x of shares outstanding. With a company called Russell Investments Group, LLC owning over 80% of AMZN shares.^(5) That should show you, that these FINRA numbers arent correct all the time. Especially with high volumes like in GME, there are a lot of Duplicates because of reporting delays.\n\n^(5:) [^(Finra)](https:\/\/finra-markets.morningstar.com\/MarketData\/EquityOptions\/detail.jsp?query=126:0P000000B7)^(, Tab: Shareholders)\n\nWith that being said, the amount of GME shares hold by Institutions still seems suspiciously high to me. And there are other things like the reported 111% Short interest in XRT^(6) or the still abnormally high Short interest in GME. That means remaining shorts could still be a nice catalyst for a possible gamma squezze.\n\n^(6:) [^(Etf channel)](https:\/\/etfchannel.com\/symbol\/xrt\/)\n\n**Gamma squezze:**\n\nA gamma squezze, often underestimated compared to his brother the short squezze. But I think this was the main reason for the surge in January and the surge last week. Especially last week was probably a well set up and executed option chain by big whales.\n\n*So how can \ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d profit from a gamma squezze?* Just take a look at the current option chains. u\/indonesian_activist did a great [excel sheet](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/lxkeg0\/repost_gme_squeeze_calculator\/), where you can see how many shares MMs have to buy if GME reaches a certain price. Just type in the current price and the projected price.\n\n^(Note: I did update his excel sheet with the new data, which you can find) [^(here)](https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1ZYGIff3Iq7UNyo88SVevj32rcYs0oqlS\/view?usp=sharing)^(. Also I added, an option on the cover, so that you can decide which Option expiring dates you want to include.)\n\n*But how many shares are enough to cause a gamma squeeze?* This is really hard to say, but according to u\/CoastalHotDog835 [post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/lycj6f\/gme_dd_part_2_taking_a_look_at_the_0603_calls\/). Last weeks surge had the following option volumes:\n\n>*1.86M shares at $55 = $102.3Million*  \n>  \n>*2.90M shares at $120 = $348Million*\n\nSo these are probably numbers we need to see again.\n\n^(Note: These are just two Strike prices. I can not say how much other options with other strike prices e. g. 100$ played a role nor do I know how high their volume was. Unluckily most sites dont have data for the past.)\n\n*So whats the current situation with GME options?*\n\nFor the options expiring the coming week, we need to have at least a doubling of the price to see the same amount of shares having to be bought by MMs compared with last weeks 55$ calls.\n\n^(Note: It is not fully sufficient compare these two numbers. On the one hand in the excel there are shares already hedged deducted, which decreases the numbers of shares. On the other hand there are not only options included with the projected strike price but all options. I hope, in the absense of better numbers for the option volumes of last week as already stated above, that these two effects could equalize each other.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Shares need to be bought by MMs if GME hits 300$ for options expiring 03\\\/12](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/jm8qjkjveml61.png?width=1488&format=png&auto=webp&s=541ebeaac563fad9fa536ba770d98f0566acc967)\n\nBut for the week after that it looks a lot better. Only a price of 190$ would be needed to see the same amount of shares having to be bought by MMs compared with last weeks 55$ calls. This is only a value increase of roughly 40%, which is very well possible. Especially if we really have some big whales on our side like, what is seeming to be the case.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Shares need to be bought by MMs if GME hits 190$ for options expiring 03\\\/19](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/0rtacqi7fml61.png?width=1474&format=png&auto=webp&s=da36500a6dc4406d36a091a687b722d22b40cccb)\n\nI may be adding some more analysis thoughts later. But I will wait with that until I know people are actually reading this.\n\nAnd of course no financial advice!\n\nEDIT: Someone in the comments has pointed out that I actually misspelled Squeeze. Sorry for that.

        "989":"Tech stocks being in a bubble is a lie. Don't let TSLA and AAPL fool you I am not going to do the homework for you guys. Just go to any financial statistics website and look at the PE ratio of the majority of the stocks inside ETFS like QQQ. Their PE ratio and net revenue \/ cash flow to stock prices are not actually up but either stable or slightly lower. The only exception to this rule are meme stocks like TSLA, GME etc. AAPL is an exception too but AAPL's net revenue is quickly catching up. But ETFs and tech stock market in general are not in a bubble, you are looking at less than a handful of stocks to make this determination.\n\nYou guys are also forgetting that we are currently undergoing a technology revolution like never before. Covid-19 put technology in the forefront and it's like the invention of the steam engine right now. Everything in tech and the cyberspace in particular is literally going to skyrocket in the upcoming years. People who are going full time in right now will be the winners and history will know it. Jury is out for if these meme stocks are overvalued too because we don't know their future potential (TSLA, NIO etc - minority of the tech stocks). What is happening right now is that safe money is moving out of stocks and either into bonds or cash. Because of inflation cash is going to take a huge hit in a year or so when we finally have the figures for how much Covid-19 cost us in American dollars. So not only will people miss out on the huge gains post-tech revolution but they will also take a big hit for holding cash.\n\nI am not going to say if I am a financial expert or not. It is common sense. But I was never a part of these PLTR, GME and TLRY ponzi schemes. These people are worse than the hedge funds because they are just as greedy but far less educated \/ invested. It was a pyramid scheme where the first guy in took the most gains. I don't believe in something like a store that sells physical copies of video games to ever succeed rofl. Let's not forget Gamestop offering $3 for a game they would later sell for $40. All you bozos did was bail out the assholes that were invested in an asshole company and had poor retail investors take the hit for it. You people took advantage of depressed anxious jobless individuals and now many of them are left without much. I took a big hit from TSLA too (silly me). But I do believe in the cyberspace taking off big time in the upcoming years and it'd be the most valuable resource imaginable. You are seeing news right now about tech stocks being in a bubble over and over. You are also seeing news about some bond bullshit going up. It's the news that wants you to get out so the big whales can go in cheap - right before Biden administration goes all in on the clean energy and tech sector.

        "990":"GME vs VW Squeeze, NOT THE SAME! But I also like the stock \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude80 TLDR: VW's squeeze was very different to the coming GME squeeze and people should be careful of some maybe false promises here. \n\nHello fellow ape friends... As I have seen many many posts and comments where people compare VW with GME and because Germany and my great great great grandfather uncle A.H. (just kidding) fucked up the world so bad I see it as my duty as a german retarded ape to clear some things up:\n\nJust recently one particular post\/comment (Cant find it anymore) caught my eye where one of our fellow brothers said: Don't you worry about your exit strategy, you will have plenty of time to react, look at the VW squeeze that took forever as well. \n\nYes but....WRONG! \n\nI don't want to tell you the whole VW story now... You can find it in the magical world of the www (Wikipedia or whatever), but to sum the important facts up for you:\n\n(Translated from german Wikipedia):\n\n\"An example of a short squeeze is the price explosion of Volkswagen ordinary shares that began on October 27, 2008. [1] On October 26, 2008, the Porsche company announced that it had increased its stake in VW from 35% to 42.6% and, with options for a further 31.5%, would have a total stake of 74.1%. Speculators, especially hedge funds, had bet on falling prices and sold VW common shares short. Since the state of Lower Saxony held a further 20% of the VW shares, less than 6% of the VW shares remained freely tradable. The short sellers had borrowed 12% of the VW shares that they had to buy to repay the loan on the stock market. So they were in a short squeeze.\"\n\nIn Short:\n\nPorsche had 74,1%\n\nNiedersachsen (Lower Saxony - \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02), a \"state\" of Germany had 20%\n\nSo the free float available was at around only 6% and as mentioned above around 12% were borrowed. \n\nWhat's important here is: There were only TWO parties that had 94% of the stocks and they could just do whatever they wanted, it was very easy for them to just hold and the stock price went crazy for quite a long time,BUT: \n\nThere are millions of apes like me and dozens of Hedgies and what more that got GME stocks, and every single person or institution has its one target price\/planned sell price\/price tolerance or whatever you wanna call it. And when some people will start to sell (and they will) and there will be some big drops, more and more paper handed bitches will sell just like in the first squeeze and it will go down FAST. \n\nThats why you just can't compare those two at all and IMO the GME squeeze will happen much faster and you should really think deep about how and when you wanna exit this. \n\nTo give this a final personal touch: Because of all the DD I've seen so far (Some of them are extraodinary) and the many Call Options at 800$ and that potential Gama squeeze I personally see a chance of about 95,7931% of GME hitting 1.000$ but not that much more.... Please dont stone me for that. \n\nHowever I also see a chance of 4,2069% (You really just got it now?) of GME hitting 42.069$\n\nSince I am very new to Reddit let me Introduce myself: I am not a financial advisor, just a (german) retarded ape like you and I really like the stock!\n\n...Made 5k\u20ac at first squeeze, bought in again after first drop and bagholded and average priced dow a little since then: Now holding 67 x GME @ 100\u20ac \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude80\n\n... Please correct me if I am totally wrong here.",

Drifted well below $124.01 early in the trading day as the whole market tumbled. Rebounded strong in the second half of the day with a huge surge and once again finished above this projected baseline at $128.50.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 1: This theory is also correlative with\/supported by the fact GME fought hard to stay green yesterday (March 3rd) when the entire market was bleeding. It will be interesting to see how it responds when we approach the close today since we've spent the early morning under this baseline as part of a complete market selloff.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet me begin by saying, this could be an absolute coincidence, but my tinfoil hat and Alex Jones voodoo doll suggested otherwise.

This behemoth has already shelled out \\~$104MM for these options and has the RIGHT, not obligation, to shell out an additional $12,298,500 for the actual shares.\n\n$104,582,725 + $12,298,500 = **$116,881,225 (purchase price + exercise price)**\n\nWe also know the total # of shares to be \\[potentially\\] exercised is 942,500.\n\nUsing this information, we\u2019ve (me, mostly) done enough work to extrapolate a rough break-even price for this colossus of clout buyer.\n\n**$116,881,225 \/ 942,500 = 124.01**\n\n# This big whale\u2019s total breakeven price lands at $124.01\/share.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShut the hell up.

My wager would be on the former, but also the latter.\n\n**In any case, anyone who drops \\~$116M over the course of three days has some deeeeeepfuckiinngggpockets. They have more money, that\u2019s a fucking fact.**\n\nCompound that with this buyer\u2019s breakeven at $124.01. **It logically follows, we have found our new BASELINE PRICE for GME.** Let me explain.\n\nConsider all this information with what happened yesterday. **GME CLOSED AT $124.18. JUST 17 CENTS ABOVE THIS BUYER\u2019s BREAKEVEN.**\n\nWhat ensued in AH? A back-and-forth teetertotter throughout the entire AH session. Ultimately, every time GME dropped below $124 it hit a springboard back above the closing price and finally finished at $125.00 flat.\n\nIn sum, I believe the new baseline price is $124.01. Relying on my aforementioned ability to deduce logical reasoning, I am resolute in my opinion that this big bag dickslanger will be valiantly defending his\/her breakeven price at $124.01. Do not get this confused with them giving a fuck about us or anyone else. They might, but its in their own best interest to hold that line, whether it benefits us or not is probably the least of their concern. Furthermore, think about it yourself, if you dropped a combined $100M in three consecutive days, you must have a contingency plan. It is my belief that this multi-hundred millionaire (potentially billionaire), has much deeper pockets than what they leveraged on the options. They'll almost assuredly be using millions more to ensure the success of their $100M+ options play.\n\nI would be remissed if I didn't acknowledge there's a slight possibility this person is just a dumbass Ape like us hitting a ballsdeep YOLO play with his entire Trustfund inheritance. But I doubt it.\n\nIn the event my hypothesis checks out, GME is currently sitting at its new support level. This is bullish and provides a good buying opportunity.\n\n# TL;DR.\n\n**I believe the new baseline price for GME is $124.01.** This is the breakeven price of a huge fucking whale that spent \\~$104M (\\~$116M if exercised) on call options spanning the last three days, March 1st-March 3rd.\n\nWith that in mind **GME closed yesterday at $124.18.

However, as we all know, market is bearish, and everything goes with it. But looking into the recent events with GameStop, I got myself wondering.

Therefore, creating and extreme down movement, which he capitalize on it, because a lot of people just react to information and don't educate themselves before selling or buying, and hurting people that have a honest plan to invest in an apparent good business model. I understand the risks in investing in a fairly new company, but there is no limit to what these guys can put out there? They can say any crap, and then capitalize in people's overreaction?

Where are all the hundreds of thousands of put options???**\n\nMy guess is that Hedgies are putting in these gigantic orders on gme saying its gonna go down  during lunch hours, when there is least activity thus driving the price of gme down even tho its supposed to be gaining retarded 40% gains everyday due to SI...\n\nThese orders all stayed in, the first 10 even 20 minutes of market open..I thought they probably won\u2019t change since I just started to actually use bren, but then I look and its way different...\n\nSome of y\u2019all are gonna hate but Ive been watching RKT alongside since this week.. Funny thing is when RKT went up 40% in one day, GME started dropping, Correlation?\n\nEdit2:   the Short Interest on borrowing shares of RKT was 55% the other day March 3rd, RKT went up 40% or so to a high of like $41 on March 3rd... today it went back down to mid 20s and the borrow rate is still 44%??\n\n Citdadel has short positions in both, they cant win on both sides so they had to sell RKT positions, increasing the price massively since there was a high demand because  \u201c dividend news\u201d  finally hit main stream and a bunch of subs started pumping it, making citadel insane profits on the way up  AND on the way down .. Mind you, the dividend news was from Jan 29 I Believe, so it was all coordinated to make online retards bag holders.... and so apes bought it and some sold for loss, others sold for good gains, but others are just holding because they too now like the stock. It has 44% Borrow Rate and only 300k shares available as of 2PM EST March 4th..\n\nSo they make money on RKT going up and down,  continue short laddering GME to keep the price suppressed. IT all  worked in their favor but RKT doesnt seem to be dropping below $25,or heck it wont even go below $20 because ill buy more LOL! some diamond hands got in and started fucking shit up, like me hehe, 58 shares Wassup baby\n\nMind you beginning of March, and even at its IPO RKT was only at \\~$20.. During their IPO they only put out 1\/3 of their float because there wasn\u2019t a high demand, the news \u201coddly didnt cover or care about their debut\u201d which is the same gay bears  were dealing with, meaning in the future more shares are to be put out but until then cant the price of its shares quadruple if shorts are forced to cover??

        "1000":"GME DD, HF can't cover their short by the call options! Disclaim Not financial advice!\n\nFirst, I am an international student, so my grammar isn't great. Apologize for that first.\n\nI see many people quoting the options volume; Trading volume is the number of shares or contracts traded in a given period. And Open interest is the total number of option contracts that are currently out there. These contracts have been traded but not yet liquidated by an offsetting trade or an exercise or assignment.\n\nIf we are looking for a call chain exercise to cause the gamma squeeze, we should look at the open interest because those are the options not being exercised or offset.\n\nI see a lot of saying that HF can cover their entire short position by buying huge call options to cover their short position and become long-sided.\n\nFirst, if they choose to close their position by call option, it would be more expensive than buying a regular share in the market because you need to pay the premium. They may have some hedge option for their short position, but there would always be more expensive to cover their short position by call option.\n\nEven they choose to do so, it would likely be done when GME falls to the 40 range, which is the cheapest time to buy a call option in the past two weeks. Most of the call options are open last week or this week which is super expensive; consider the IV. ( I think they didn't even think about covering at a loss) .\n\nThen let's take a look at the call option that expires in Mar5. 127232 call options are open, and 31676 call options are in the money. And only the options ITM would be exercised, 31676\\*100=3167600, which only 3 million shares. Let make a minimum assumption that the short position they hold is 60% of the float according to finra, which is 60%\\*45m=27m short position so, if they exercise those call options, which only cover 11.7% of their short position. It would collapse their whole shot position by interest market price by 100,200,300%.\n\nI didn't put the following call options into consideration because there is no point cover their short position multiple times, which could hugely inflate their losses.\n\nSo, call options can't be a good way for them to cover.\n\nPlease correct me if I have any mistakes.\n\nPosition, 104@110\n\nEDIT: Also, they may cover some of their position on the first run-up and short it again when GME falling, but remember that the short borrow interest is as high as over 20%. They lost money for sure, and the interest rate also becomes higher, which makes the second run-up worse for them.   \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nEDIT2: For those who don't know how option pricing, here is the thing, the more call HF purchase, the more iv it is, and the option price shoots up also.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/xxz9n4eh9yk61.png?width=1419&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d59f77026b9bafba00d7098f4aabc8bea6e8665\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/lb2qh7ji9yk61.png?width=1542&format=png&auto=webp&s=73ae785774649bb6b53f6f01b7e359a75b4315f8",
        "1001":"One apes thoughts on everything going down I am curious to know if I am in the minority or majority on some thoughts I have on the ongoing saga of GME vs. everything else. I will TL;DR at the bottom in the order that I present my following points. In case I miss saying it anywhere, the following post is **my opinion.**\n\nFirst full disclosure I have a position in GME and BB (and other non-WSB stocks). With that out of the way lets get started:\n\n1. I am holding GME for the tendies...BUT it has an added bonus **in my opinion** the potential of exposing very questionable trading practices by some parties on the other side. The longer this goes on, the more desperate other parties will get, bigger chance for a slip up (such as the RH buying halt). I also hold for the sweet loss porn of hedge funds affected.\n2. Other stocks that have DD but I do not hold. Yes, I have been down voting them (with the exception of AMC though). No, not because I immediately assume they are shills but rather I personally don't understand the logic of presenting a new stock to YOLO when the DD for GME is so insanely well documented and vetted.\n\n* More on point 2, I understand apes will not necessarily want to YOLO everything on 1 stock and may want to diversify. Again this is only **my opinion,** if that is the case though I would think it more sensible to pick a YOLO\/Meme stock of your own choosing and then throw down in some more \"normal\" stocks. But hey for those that went into multiple YOLO\/Meme stocks, all the power to ya. This is WallStreet**BETS**, not WallStreet**SENSIBLE**.\n\n3. Here are facts, WSB currently has 9.4 million degenerates. The spike in accounts was occurring over the period of time WSB was making media headlines. Media outlets were showing selected WSB posts on mainstream media therefore there are members of the media on WSB (perhaps not with accounts but proven to be digging thru the sub.\n\n* Now for **my opinion**. I believe it is very likely that many of the new WSBers are here to stir shit up. Some of them are detracting from GME and I believe that there are some that are supporting GME. Yes, I think there are big players here who are competitors to the hedge funds that are currently trapped shorting GME. To me this seems like a logical move, especially for a hedge fund that sees an opportunity to gobble up another businesses' clients.\n\nTL;DR **my opinion**\n\n1. Why I hold. GME = Tendies + potential extra bonuses (RH oopsie)\n2. I down vote non-GME DD. Not because bad DD, but because GME DD > \"insert ticker\" DD\n3. WSB = Big community = media attention = bad actors = bad actors **FOR** and **AGAINST** GME\n4. There is no #4, this was a test\n\nAnd that's my two cents.",
        "1002":"The modern day witch-hunt that has become WSB and a plea for the revival of the old WSB. It\u2019s quite obvious that since January there has been a MASSIVE influx of new members to WSB. As an open community, WSB happily welcomes as many new people as we can get but I\u2019m concerned about how that\u2019s changed the dynamic of the subreddit. Before the rise of GME, WSB was a space where everyone was free to discuss various ideas, share DD and gains\/loss porn, and post memes about ANY STOCK they liked or were interested in. Even when popular stocks like Tesla and Palantir came about, they never 100% CONSUMED the discussion diversity of the sub.\n\nNowadays, you come on the sub and literally ALL you see is content related to GME. I personally don\u2019t mind all the GME banter, however, what I do mind is the fact that are tens of thousands of other stocks and opportunities yet many people on the sub act like GameStop is the only company that exists. Too many times have I seen a user on the sub post about some investment idea and get immediately shot down and called out for allegedly being a hedgie or shill trying to lift the focus off GME. \n\nAT THE END OF THE DAY THE GOAL OF INVESTING IS TO MAKE MONEY.

However, I want to make sure my thoughts on the matter are at least out there. Long live diamond hands and power to the player but please remain OPEN MINDED.

        "1004":"GME's Future: Steamkiller ***Edit:*** **Special thanks to the mods for their quick response time in this post's auto-deletion. We really appreciate the hard work you guys are doing. Well, I do anyway.**\n\n*Disclaimer: Feel free to add objective\/rebuking opinions here, I have no hate or disdain for opposite views. I'd welcome some constructive discussion on whether my viewpoint sounds viable or not. I'm in this deep either way.*\n\nSo I've worked in the game industry as a Tech Artist for just over 8 years now, and I connected some dots in January while reading through all the DD about GME.  I've dealt with publishers and capital management firms both in person at GDC and elsewhere, and I am working on my own game project on the side so I am actively dealing with platforms and launching, and I still hold to my guess that **Ryan is aiming at launching an online distribution service to compete with Steam, and potentially overtake it as the strongest digital games distribution platform.**\n\nWhy? Steam doesn't have much competition outside of other publishers who mostly just have a store to front their own games. Gamestop could become an unbiased online platform that also has physical stores where you can buy consoles, PC parts, and trade in used games for credit in said online platform. It's not a gold mine, it's a diamond-encrusted tendie mine waiting to be built. Gamestop has the ability to focus their resources around this strategy, and now is the time to do it.\n\nRyan already has a focus on digital commerce and there is a reason he started following Steam and Epic, and why they are moving more into PC gaming and improving their digital footprint. I can't tell you how long I have felt that Steam is kind of a monopoly in the market, and whoever manages to launch a solid competitor to them is going to be rich beyond their wildest dreams.\n\nSteam makes 30% from the sale of every single game on their platform, and they have a ridiculously small staff running the entire service. It's built to be almost entirely automated, even down to the advertisements running on the store pages. I talked to a bunch of Valve guys at an indy conference a couple years ago and they said the amount of money Steam makes is disgusting considering how little is needed to keep it running, and it needs almost no improvement since it runs well and people like it.\n\nIf they pull it off and become a major competitor to Steam, a 40b, 50b, and even 100b market cap isn't unrealistic in 5 years. Why? If you knew how many games Steam sells on an average basis, you would crap yourself. And as I said, they take a 30% cut across the board. Do you know how much 30% of every game sold on Steam is? I'll give you a hint: it's a lot. Steam has essentially been printing money for years with no real competition. Epic Games is still getting started and is popular with only a few of their titles so far, they are expanding but their focus is divided between the store, Fortnite, publishing, and of course their Engine, which I use regularly and love. Gamestop in this space would be 100% focused on their store and ecommerce. That is a big deal.\n\nA 100b market cap would value GME at $1431 per share if compared to today's 124 @ 8.66b, at regular market valuation. That's not the squeeze number. Even 40b on a conservative estimate puts it at $572\/share.\n\nI'm not a trade aficionado so my calculations about the valuations may not be spot on since my specialty is in my industry and not finance. I'm open to more business\/finance wrinkle-brains to give me more accurate numbers for those market caps. But Steam has been without any real competition for over a decade now, and Gamestop has the capital, infrastructure, and now the leadership to make this happen.\n\nI'm looking forward to the squeeze as much as the rest of you but to be 100% honest, this is going to go Nuclear if I am right, and not as a temporary squeeze. I could be wrong, but in my mind it would be stupid of them not to do it, they have all the pieces ready, and Ryan is the puzzlemaster.\n\nLet's fucking go.\n\n***TLDR: Gamestop may be positioning themselves to become a major competitor in the digital game distribution market alongside and potentially even surpassing Steam, Epic, and GoG.***\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n**Edit:** 230 @ 125. I'm going to be adding to my position as often as I can because if I am right ***this is going to make 150\/share during a squeeze seem like peanuts***. What's past alpha centuri?\n\n**Edit 2:** Loving the discussion this is provoking.

Not to mention that a CEO that specializes in B&M locations is the polar opposite of the future vision for GME.\n\nThe news that Sherman has \"resigned\" is going to be an insane catalyst, things are only looking good from here on out\u201d",

        "1014":"Warning to new retards when day trading on margin This just burned me even though I thought I understood the pattern day trade rule and I can't trade on margin in my account for 95 days, so I wanted to share this with other ~~new investors~~ retards so they don't get burned by the pattern day trade rule like me.\n\n**This is not investment advice**, this is clarifying SEC-mandated regulations on what counts as a \"day trade\". Also, this is probably obvious to you seasoned artists (it is to me after Fidelity explained this all to me on the phone), but smooth-brained apes like myself might not understand this, or even panic at waking up to any margin call for $25000 (note - if you don't meet this you're not on the hook for it - you just get restrictions placed on your account for some time). Or maybe you read the many topics on day trading available on the internet and came to the same (wrong) conclusion as me.\n\nPattern day traders have different margin requirements than interday or non-pattern day traders. A pattern day trader is classified as someone who \"day trades 4 or more times in a 5 day period\", and a day trade is classified as \"the opening and closing of securities on the same day\". What sites don't explain better is that this is based on the *number of open positions, not the number of times you sell*.\n\nFor example, Fidelity explains [day trading on margin](https:\/\/www.fidelity.com\/learning-center\/trading-investing\/trading\/day-trading-margin), and their following example of a day trade:\n\n- A purchase of 250 shares of ABC stock at 10 a.m., followed by a purchase of another 250 ABC shares at 11 a.m., followed by a sale of 500 ABC shares at 3 p.m.\n\nwhen read in the context of the page I linked to seems to imply that this would count as a single day trade. This is not the case. Over the course of yesterday I bought 92 shares of RKT over 6 orders, and I sold 70 of them near market close. This morning I woke up to a text saying I am subject to a day trade minimum equity call, and I now need to maintain equity of $25,000 or more to trade on margin.\n\nI'm not going to meet this (I have no interest in tying up $25,000 for pattern day trading), so in 5 days my account will be restricted to cash buying only for 90 days (though I can't trade on margin for the next 5 days anyways so it's basically 95 days), and I need to avoid day trading at all in that account or else the counter may reset. After 60 days of no day trades in the account, you revert to non-pattern day trade status, but for missing the minimum equity call you still can't trade on margin for 30 days after that.\n\nI have a cash account I usually day trade out of, but I impulse closed all of my other positions (besides GME) and YOLO'd into RKT. I profited nicely of of yesterday but this was the result of my greed. I at least have a decent amount of cash to invest after yesterday (and I did buy 5 more GME shares today, still holding 27 RKT positions), but I would not have bought 92 shares over several orders had I understood this would result in 5 day trades for the separate positions I had opened, not just one trade for the single sell order.\n\nLast thing I want to mention: don't trade on margin unless you know the risks. And if you are unsure of anything, you can always call your broker. And if you can't, stop trading on CashApp or RobinHood and get a real broker you absolute mong.\n\nAs for me... well I just bought 5 more shares of GME this morning with cash so maybe y'all can help me meet that minimum equity call :D (just kidding, this is not investment advice).

The variety of people, the thoroughness of their research, and the veracity with which they defend it, make this place what it is.  \n\nI only began trading as a side hustle at the start of the pandemic (with modest success).  My biggest wins came from WSB.  When the real push on GME started, I was there.  I was a bag holder of GME after January, but my bag wasn't too large  and I liked the stock, so I grew some diamond hands and held.  I started really following the day-to-day threads, reading every piece of financial news I could, watched Bruce eat his bagels, and developed a much deeper understanding of the market in general.  \n\nI don't listen to all the advice I see on here... and I don't blindly trust DD.  \n\nWhy I feel I need to post today:  \nThe mood in this sub has changed drastically over the last 24 hours.  The rift I see between the GME folks and the RKT folks saddens me greatly.  I don't know exactly how I fee about RKT... something just seems too contrived about it.\n\nI've seen some DD that suggests it's a HF ploy to pull people out of GME.  If that's the case, I don't think it will be successful.  GME apes are strong.  You don't just lose your diamond hands on a whim.\n\nI've seen other DD that suggests it's a HF hedge and their using this to boost their capital in order to better defend their position in GME\/AMC.  This seems a bit more plausible to me, but I'm  still not 100% convinced.  A lot of people are posting massive gains (sincere congratulations). \n\nWhat conclusion I have come to is this.  If I were a HF or a MM who needed WSB to fracture, I would seed disunity and distrust among the community.  I would send every bot or shill I could in every direction.  Some strongly defending RKT, some tearing it down.  Some screaming GME is dead, while others quietly suggest taking gains from RKT and rolling them into UWMC.  I wouldn't suggest a shit stock that I knew nobody would listen about... I would use my best DD and find something that could tear attention away from GME and tear the community apart.

        "1020":"Choosing between $GME & $AMC, Let's gooooooooo $AMC to the fucking moon! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 Listen Swamp Fox here, I found this chicken coup that's not guarded by any dogs. Coast is clear for now, you better eat as much chickens and eggs as possible. Cuz the dogs and bears are coming for our gains and chickens. $AMC is safe to go to the moon for a few days but will taper off next week. Saddle the fuck up, stay the fuck away from $GME unless you have balls of steel and trying to catch an aneurysm. But if you time it well, you might drive a new car. But I can't assure you. I will say, today's pop of $GME was a change of CFO in the company, showing they are serious about their management. So, it might be a legit company but the sugar rush can get you killed.\nI'm not too greedy, so Imma stick with the smaller chicken, $AMC does have a solid balance sheet and very low debt. Soon to be acquired. I think there may be three pops.\n\n\n1. Riding the $GME meme stock wave, but tapers cuz Wallstreet gonna bitch a little and Robinhood might do their fuckery. \n\n2. The second pop gonna piggyback on the news for opening 13 theaters in the east coast in March. I think it might taper off due to mix reactions of the theaters opening.\n\n3. The third one I think it's gonna be related to being acquired cuz I think the players will see the potential in $AMC to integrate it into their existing streaming service.\n\n If I were in the mind of any company let's say Amazon or Netflix who are currently in talks on acquiring the mega cinema movie chain.\n \nThis would be the perfect opportunity to recoup lost revenue from 2020 COVID pandemic shutdown,bit will bolster their revenue by expanding the existing A-Lister program from $AMC to either companies existing streaming service subscriptions. And I would provide discount deals to like 20% off to combine the streaming service and enjoying the new ticket movie reservation experience at the theaters.\n\nSomewhat similar to what HBO max is doing, but there's a possibility that the streaming service titans will now have a new jar that they can stick they hands in, the movies theater and distribution industry. Because if they own the movies, they now can receive their cut from movie distribution like Disney who hold their properties close to the chest to play their movies on the newly owned theaters. Some movies that either streaming service owns rights to, they'll have the more affordable plans without the theater plan if that customer isn't comfortable to go to the theaters or even prefer the comfort of their home. How ever it goes, it's going to be a solid win for either Amazon or Netflix.\n\nThat's just an opinion and an idea of mine. I'm not a financial advisor, please do your own research. I'm just a Fox who loves fucking shit up in the Swamp and help other to eat some too if they're silly as I am.\nPosted 2\/26 on social media.",

I decided to get in PLTR call options. Honestly, I have no idea whats PLTR planning in the next coming month, they have some great new partnerships and some awesome (long-term) projects in the pipeline. I have been seeing alot of great DD on PLTR in the sub and others. Other DD suggests that the market cap is way too high for the revenue they are generating. I believe that fundamentals are not the biggest factor anymore, now that all of us got our stim checks, and are yoloing money at shares that never had great fundamentals. True, PLTR may be overvalued, but name a silicon valley company that is not? Furthermore, PLTR is a company that actually has value.  \n\n\nThe play:\n\nRight now the options are going for cheap. The share price has sunk down, after GME gang started loosing money and wsb went quiet. However, we are seeing bullish trends in the entire market, and specifically on the shares this sub is interested in.  \nAround Feb 1 the stock was trading at 31 usd and then continued to YTD High of 38 usd on Feb 9th, just lagging behind GME's ATH.   \nI suspect that with the new RKT and GME gang making money, they are gonna be just as retarded as me and gonna slowly start cashing out and be just as greedy to find the next play. Unfortunately there is a lack of DD posts and GME and RKT are now flooding wsb, but there has been a steady stream of wsbers buying Palantir stock and call options.\n\nIm buying the call options at 30.00 expiring june 18th 2021, if they are even slightly in the money, I will execute the options. In the big change I am wrong and full of shit, the loss will be minimal.  I am not yoloing my NW but just looking to make some extra.\n\nHarsh feedback welcome",

        "1032":"Why $RKT is the catalyst to send $GME to the Moon Alright, learn to read fuckers because this is gonna be a long one.\n\nBefore I get started, can you morons who are shitting all over $RKT buyers shut up? WallStreetBets is about making money, doesn't matter what play. And yes, there will be some bagholders on that one. But everyone playing it knows the risk. There's only two appropriate responses if someone tells you they bought into $RKT. 1)If they lose money, you troll them and call them a retard. 2)They make money, and you congratulate them and tell them to fuck themselves.\n\nNow, none of you are wrong to be skeptical about the play. It does in fact seem too easy, doesn't it? Well, as noted in the below post, at LEAST two of the hedge funds we're fighting on the GME front are in on the $RKT play:\n\n[https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/lw0g1g\/the\\_industry\\_players\\_again\\_gme\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/lw0g1g\/the_industry_players_again_gme\/)\n\n(Credit to u\/Dadri88 and u\/skifunkster)\n\nBut what if I told you it didn't matter that they were profiting off that play? I'm serious, it doesn't matter. Even if they personally asked the Board of Rocket to declare the special dividend, and planned to mobilize WSB in pursuit of profit (They didn't do this), we should still be lining up to kiss them. They're hanging themselves in front of our eyes. Here's why:\n\n$GME needs a catalyst. We've known this is still a legitimate play, but most posts are in agreement. We needs whales, we need hedge funds on our side, and we need catalysts. We now have SEVERAL catalysts. In case you've forgotten, the catalysts for GME occuring this month are: Earnings, The Quadruple Witching Day, and now $RKT.\n\nWhy is $RKT a catalyst for GME? We're not quite at the finish line yet. How will we know when we're close? They'll pull out our controllers again (Limiting Buying). How do they wind up defeated if they do this? Big money on our side. $RKT will get us that money. If you're still too retarded to picture it, let me provide an example.\n\nImagine you're Papa Elon. You want to shoot your SpaceX Rockets to the Moon and beyond. So far, you've loaded the ships with apes and bananas, but you need some ACTUAL astronauts on board. How do you earn the trust of the real astronauts (AKA BIG MONEY)? You launch a test flight. $RKT is the SpaceX test flight, retards. It doesn't matter if you like the play, if you're in on the action, or not. You SHOULD be cheering it on.\n\nIf it works, we have proof of concept. Imagine it: A Massive short squeeze on a company where the short interest is only 30-40%. What do you think will prove our point that squeezes can be squoze, better than seeing a real live squeeze in public view? It's literally the best thing that could happen.\n\nSo, moral of the story: Sit back, shut the fuck up, and cheer those other retards on! If that play works, it will help send our own to the goddamn moon! Smile apes, and I'll see you on the Moon!\n\nEdit: This is of course, not financial advice. I am a dumb ape, who picks his nose and eats it. I just like the stonks. And I'll HOLD!",

The DIP is being purchased, even while at an ATH.  Someone is on the LONG side buying up shares with retail.\n\nIn my opinion, after today, short interest could potentially even end up way higher than 40%. Look at the candles during those short ladder attacks. Shorts had to have borrow MILLIONS of shares to attempt to short ladder today. I wouldn't be surprised if this is Melvin & CO's latest play to dig themselves out of their Gamestop loss porn either.\n\nMORE SHORTING = MORE SHORTS TO CHOKE\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo that's reason 1. There's a nonzero chance Jay Farner drops a bomb tomorrow that takes us to the stratosphere. But what's reason 2?\n\n\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8MY PRICE TARGET FOR RKT IS $73.5 \ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\n\nLet's go through the numbers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRKT's projected EPS for this year is \\~ $2.45.\n\n\\[LINK 3\\] \\~ (SOURCE IS ON SA, REMOVED LINK BECAUSE IT WAS GETTING MY POST DELETED)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo get P\/E, take the price and divide by earnings. Thus, we can use this to calculate the forward P\/E for RKT. RKT closed at $41.79, which divided by $2.45 is \\~17.05. Thus, RKT currently trades at about a 17Forward P\/E. Companies in this sector trade in between 15-30 P\/E, and since I strongly believe RKT is a growth stock, I think it should trade at 30x P\/E.\n\nThus, 30 x $2.45 is $73.5.\n\nTherefore, my PT for RKT is $73.5. RKT is a fintech company, and is a PROFITABLE one. Think about how many fintech companies have crazier valuations and aren't even profitable?\n\nYou know what that means?\n\nIT'S NOT FUCKING OVER. IF SUITS ARE BUYING AT ATH, IM BUYING AT ATH. IF SHORTS HAVE RELOADED, THE SQUEEZE HAS NOT SQUOZE. THE SUITS AGREE. RKT IS WORTH MORE THAN $40.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: SHORT INTEREST HAS PROBABLY GONE UP, SUITS ARE BUYING. CURRENT P\/E is 17, GROWTH PE IN MY OPINION SHOULD BE AT LEAST 30. RKT IS STILL UNDERVALUED, AND MY PRICE TARGET IS $73.5\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRemember, \ud83d\ude80 fundamentally a great company. They are still NOT priced as a growth stock. They are still NOT considered Fintech by the suits. There is a reason why this stock closed strong at a new ATH.\n\nI LIKE THE STOCK.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8My PT is $73.5. \ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\n\n\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea850 TOMORROW \ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\n\n\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea860 to 70+ EOW if the shorts bail instead of of doubling down.\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\n\nTHIS IS NOT A \ud83e\uddfb\ud83d\udc50TRADE\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot financial advice.

I mean serious green, despite the quote on quote \"**Lackluster day**\" we are still up **162.5%** the past WEEK!\n2. **A stock with relatively little discussion on this page (IN COMPARISON TO GME) (RKT) is suddenly piking 50,60,70% increase???** Not to knock any fellow apes who invested (hopefully we will see a dump in GME soon after) but **it is so suspicious that a large movement into RKT aligns with the GME rise.** Don't take my word on this, but we have seen in the past other **\"GAMMA SQUEEZE\" for fill in the blank as soon as GME has spiked, and what happens after? They fall and fall hard.**\n3. The HF are scared, bad. With news breaking about Melvin and Citadale breaking over the past week, we know **that they have lost billions.** Not only that , they have continued to short the stock with heavy volume. Now with naked shorting, no one knows what the present of the float is exactly, but the estimate remains high.\n\nSOURCE: Wall Street Journal, 5 days ago.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/v59kaj2xapk61.png?width=914&format=png&auto=webp&s=2530b261ce274a75e989677eb7eb32a7e5fad028\n\n**Now why you might ask losing roughly 50% of your entire capital important? If you are an autist, and I know you are, let me explain.** I mentioned this in my last post, but essential without capital, **how can HF run effective short latter attacks as we saw after the enormous initial spike? They can't- or at least we hope- with what we have seen over the past few days, GME has not seen any significant short latter attacks, heck we have gone up $20 alone this week!!! (EVEN WITH THE MARKET SHITTING ITS PANTS)**\n\n4) **With contracts being exercised last week at around $55 dollars, we saw a gamma squeeze occur.** Now I have seen 5+ people on here explain wildly differing theories ranging from, if we hit 130 it will trigger the next squeeze, or on 3\/15 the squeeze will happen! Now we can all take this with a grain of salt, after all, we are apes. **But what we can do is hold and continue to break resistance, yesterday was $113, today it was $120.** In my opinion, if we continue to rise steadily we can trigger another ITM call and see another squeeze.\n\n[F ROBINHOOD](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/w55we4o6dpk61.png?width=933&format=png&auto=webp&s=e211a49e42220b19f3998f6c764a4dbd428c5bb0)\n\n5) **I know that to your paper hands this will kill you, but if the squeeze never happens GME is a great long-term hold.

There is clear panic on the HF sides, we are up $20 from Monday with a shit ass entire market, there have been no outstanding short latter attacks, HF is down billions with high interest, there is a flood for a \"NEW SQUEEZE RKT\" (DISTRACTION), we have been stable and we are holding.

        "1038":"Too many existing shares to properly squeeze RKT. This is simple math: There are 1.7 billion more shares of RKT than there are of GME. It is mathematically impossible for it to squeeze like GME will. All the retail investors in the world do not have the combined purchase power to buy up enough RKT to truly squeeze it and hurt the hedgies. \n\nRight now all the retail investors basically hold the 20 million or so tradeable shares of GME; do the retail investors physically own all the tradeable shares of Rocket? You know, some 600+ million shares? Nope.\n\nMy guess is the HFs wanted the paper hands to sell GME and buy up RKT instead. Then these dorks will be left holding the bag.",
        "1039":"The Truth about RKT... This is not financial advice and neither do you have to listen to my opinion. I\u2019m just expressing myself...\n\nWith that being said, I honestly don\u2019t think that RKT is a shill tactic. RKT is probably a short squeeze separate to the GME and AMC squeezes. Is it distracting? it sure as hell is. Me personally, I think a squeeze is happening as we speak and so maybe it\u2019s worth investing in, maybe not.\n\nI personally do not have a position in RKT and I won\u2019t go into it because I have my cash invested into GME (as well as my other blue chips). I\u2019m still -45% (it was -82% but I continued to average down) but I very strongly believe that we are gonna see this squeeze come into play some time around 15th March - 19th March. This would be due to: the second GME hearing 17th leading to an increase in media attention, Quadruple Witching day (extreme volume trading) 19th, with GME Q4 reports coming around the 25th. If the squeeze is to happen, mostly likely it will happen around mid to end March. \n\nNow back to RKT, i think that with this volatility that I personally wouldn\u2019t sell my GME shares to free up capital to invest into RKT, why would I lock in losses and then further risk being a bag holder for the RKT squeeze because the moment to invest in would\u2019ve been 2 days ago before we saw the jump and chances are that the squeeze will be finished very soon. If you are going to invest into RKT then I suggest you deposit more cash into you account and use that instead. \n\nAt the end, it\u2019s your choice. I know we all love GME and AMC but we can\u2019t fool ourselves by calling RKT a shill. My only advice I wish you do take from this is to never get too emotional and never let seeing a stock rally make you feel greedy that you think you\u2019ll get lucky and ride that squeeze. There\u2019s no telling when it will end. But when it does it\u2019ll crash back to earth. On the other hand, GME is a squeeze entirely of its own class. One that we cannot comprehend just yet. If the squeeze happens, which I believe it will. It will be historic. One that will be on movies and taught in economics classes for the future generations.\n\nOf course you do not have to listen to me. I don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m saying. But, if we all keep holding our GME shares, then we will inevitably squeeze the greatest of all squeezes. HODL (and GL to all you RKT squeezers I guess, I hope you put some of that profit  into GME or put your losses back into GME and be ready for what I call the \u201cRocket Gamma Short Squeeze\u201d \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nEdit: I do feel very conflicted with this post I made, and I might take it down. Is it a way to directly distract us (I.e, their manipulating RKT stock upwards)?  No. but are they indirectly manipulating the stock (I.e, through all of the media coverage and bots sharing gains on WSB and stuff)? I very much think this can be the case. If you ever see an increase in posts where people are praising RKT and shaming GME then that\u2019s blatant manipulation... \nBut I just cannot stand seeing my fellow apes acting like GME cultists, we mustn\u2019t get too emotional and think everything has got to do with GME. I own some TILRAY stocks long term, and I also hold CCIV stocks long term and continue to dollar cost average down into profits. But when it comes to short term, I\u2019m solely focused on GME and AMC and I own far more GME than any other stock currently because I really believe in this movement, plus my brain would malfunction if I has to look at more than two shares at once\ud83d\ude05",

The rush of Apes who will invest in the ticker **$INKAU** will be significantly high as they will likely think it is the Australian supplier of tattoo ink. \n\nNext marker to look for is the **$1000** price break.... should GME go above this we see another flood in the tattoo industry, but also we see divergence into the \"inserting things in places the sun does not shine\"... hence the next top tip ticker to watch for bull run at $1000 are the **Lubricants and Grease** manufacturing tickers **$KAI** Kadant Inc is my pick here. \n\nBy **$5000** a share things start to get a little hard to model as soo much cash will be flowing back into the retailers hands at this point, the call options to fill of: The drinking of the own users piss is outweighed by the pure tendies spilling out of fellow apes pockets from the stonk being close to the moon. Hence I theorise that a movement will have formed off the internet that will drive up the demand for... **$TSLA, $KFC and $WENDY** as it will become \"the fashion\" to drive around in a Tesla while eating a family size bucked of KFC tendies in a Wendys parking lot.\n\nBeyond that I can not model accurately enough to share anything worthwhile, but there is one AI program that has spat out an interesting result possibility now on two separate test runs that I want you to just hold as food for thought.\n\nWhen a simulation was run at a price mark of **$42069.00 and $69420.00** per share the **Festo Octopusgripper AI robot** indicated that there was going to be a huge run on Gourds. That is right the vegetable gourd as a commodity will become very popular and the simulation recommends investing in **gourd futures**.\n\nUPDATE: Fresh off the ticker tape with a 83.7% probability if the price hits **$100,000** per share then the retail investors will pool all their tendies and buy the **actual moon** and have diamond hands tattooed on the surface to be visible from earth!\n\nNeedless to say there is not a wrinkle in my brain left so I'm gonna jump the gun and open my long positions now, I am not a financial advisor but do with this information what you will.\n\nSpace Ape out\n\nTLDR: \n\n* $500 - Tattoo Ink from Australia $INKAU\n* $1000 - Lubricants and Grease $KAI\n* $5000 - Tesla, tendies in Wendys parking lot\n* $42069 and $69420 - Future Gourds\n* $100,000 - WSB will buy the actual moon\n\nEDIT: Fresh data in.... Added Wendys and the 100k moon prediction",

        "1050":"Shorts are literally running out of bullets. Hi fellow retards!\n\nMy hypothesis and granted this may have already been postulated here is that the hedgers had enough liquidity in Jan to short GME and temper the price back down. Now it appears that they\u2019ve run out of liquidity and are forced to sell their income generating securities to continue to short in an act of desperation. \n\nAs a parallel - consider it from a mortgage perspective they\u2019re trying to stave of foreclosure by first burning through savings and now they\u2019re selling off their valuable possessions. So they can\u2019t borrow off margin, they are out of cash and now they\u2019re selling off their source of income. Which by the way hurts the passive investors that like their ETF stocks, but the hedges don\u2019t give a shit. They just want to short GME no matter the cost. \n\nThe mortgage allegory reminds me of say the 2008 crisis - I used to be a loan officer and the exotic sub prime mortgages were horse shit. You could qualify for a mortgage back then with a DTI (debt to income ratio) of 65%. For those unaware DTI is the ratio of your GROSS income vs the PITI of your home and all revolving and installment debt on your credit report. It does not factor in payments for utilities, food, gas. So they assume people can afford a house with the 35% of gross fucking income after their monthly debt is paid? No. Now the opposite is happening again. They deserve this for their insatiable greed and lack of compassion for anyone but themselves. \n\nHedgies have no cash and selling their income generating stocks to continue this fight. Eventually they\u2019ll run out of those and will have no choice but to cover no matter the price. They fucking deserve it. From their ashes I hope we can build a market that is free and open without their influence and heavy shorting a float will be illegal. If I want to pay x dollars for a stock, that\u2019s my business. Shorting is bullshit. Think a company is overvalued? Then close your position and find another fucking stock. The government should be appalled. Trying to BK a company not only puts thousands out of a job, but reduces the income tax stream from them to the gov\u2019t. Not only that but now they\u2019re on the govt payroll via unemployment. All this so they can profit off of destruction. Fuck. You. Long post I\u2019m sorry.\n\nTLDR: hedgies are going to burn for their atrocities. \n\nMy position: 914 shares of GME and one 3\/5 $100 call. The shares I\u2019d be willing to part with for say a minimum of 4 figures per share. Maybe 5 who knows? 42,069 per share has a nice ring to it. I like the stock and this isn\u2019t financial advice. Hedge funds are cucks.",
        "1051":"Why Melvin and the other HF\u2019s basically have no chance of winning...IMO! There is only one answer as to how on Earth 140% shorting was allowed. This is due to the concept of naked shorting...\n\nthis in simple terms is when shorters (like big institutions like Melvin) decide to short the stocks without locating the stock holders (basically meaning they are shorting without caring about if their shorts match the supply of holders) and this lead to 140% shorting which lead to phantom shares. This is all highly illegal except for one exception (to the best of my belief (youtube it and read up on the SEC to confirm otherwise don\u2019t believe me)... an exception to which the government will turn the check is when naked short selling a company that results in bankrupt by which they end up making big amounts of profit.\n\nWhy does this even matter? It\u2019s because through these phantom shares, they are able to manipulate the \u2018failure to deliver\u2019 system in the stock market and so through manipulating these failure to delivers they trick the algorithm into having to adjust a sell off - they do this to trick us and to make us actually fear and cause a real sell off - they belief this hype is temporary that will pass, they do not realise that we are not cats that are not playing around no more... \n\nThink about it, no honestly think about it...everyone was gunning for $1,000 the way in which we are all diamond handing this hold then why would a natural sell off occur only half way? It\u2019s because of market manipulation caused by the restrictions of being able to buy shares, the news media penetrating that the interest in GME was over and these Failure to deliver and ladder attacks. The Majority of us are still holding, holding through -80% and didn\u2019t sell when it went down why? Well it\u2019s simple. ITS BECAUSE THE SQUEEZE HAS NOT BEEN SQUOZE. \n\nNow back to naked short selling, this is market manipulation at its finest BUT, of course GameStop is no longer dead. Through the great help of Ryhan Cohen\u2019s and WSB the giant has been revived once more meaning that there is inevitable death for the HF\u2019s as long as we manage to hold. Shorting requires for interests to have to be paid in order to keep the position open. Which means that if we hold on long enough we will absorb Melvin dry. The more hype there is the more these interests go up. And that\u2019s our key to pulling off a wicked gamma squeeze like nothing seen before us...it\u2019s a great time to be alive!\n\nAnd although it may appear on screen that short interest is back under the 100% mark. I think that the final 40% of shorts won\u2019t be able to be deductible since it\u2019s made up of phantom shares. Melvins and all the other hedgefunds only way to succeed was for them to pull this short off in the shadows without anyone realising. This stock has been shorted for years! But that plan has now epically failed so now they know they have no choice but to use any dirty tactics they can to divide and conquer through any and every manipulation tactics that exist. it\u2019s corruption vs the people.

Stock Markets with Bruce has been a stalwart of the GME saga and the old silverback has been live streaming throughout the whole damn thing.

There are more calls available than tradable stock (due to naked call contracts) and thus they can then join-in the diamond hand rocket while the Chicago Market Makers (options writers) have to scramble around trying to buy more stock than exists. All this while the newly longed HF's slowly leak shares to the MM's at ever increasing prices.\n\nDoes this mean the shorts are now coming in to bat for us? I'm more than happy for smart money to yeet this thing to the moon, I'm here for tendies, nothing more, nothing less.\n\nIf I've wrongly interpreted the DD and you've been triggered, first well done for watching Bruce's video, give him a thumbs up while you're there.

Enjoy this *light* weekend reading \ud83d\ude09\n\n\\------------\n\n**Part 1: FINRA**\n\nI put together the FINRA daily short data for the last week and you can see an increase in short volume over the last 6 days! [http:\/\/regsho.FINRA.org\/regsho-Index.html](http:\/\/regsho.finra.org\/regsho-Index.html) (@CultureCrypto sent me this link that had the data in a much more friendly fashion [https:\/\/www.FINRA.org\/FINRA-data\/short-sale-volume-daily](https:\/\/www.finra.org\/finra-data\/short-sale-volume-daily))\n\n(Note: if you want to find this raw data, use the link above and you will need to go into each day's file (updated at 6pm daily) and search for GME, then copy the raw numbers. the top of the document will show you what each number corresponds to - this is not a user-friendly document)\n\nThere was an additional **22 million** in short volume today, on top of the **33m yesterday and 12m Wednesday**. While this is a decrease in absolute shorts from yesterday, volume also decreased proportionally so it is still identical short volume to total volume ratio.\n\nThe short volume as % of total daily volume, as published by FINRA, is at **57**% which is the same levels that we saw on Jan 27-29 when there was a concerted effort to bring down the share price.\n\n**CAVEATS:**\n\n* This data does not include NYSE, which is why total volume for today is 38M but actual total vol is 90 million. Thanks to u\/tri_fire_engineer for bringing this up. He has posted the full data for yesterday down in the comments and it actually showed that **once NYSE data was included, Short Volume % went up from 56.8% to 57.6%. I think this shows that while the FINRA data is just a sample, its large enough to be considered representative of the full marke**t\n* **daily data does NOT equate to % of total shares that are shorted,** as the same share could be shorted multiple time and there are other thing that lenders do which could be considered 'shorting' but is not what we would usually define. The best data is the monthly FINRA data but that only comes out once a month and that doesn't sound very fun.\n\nHere are my data tables, again all taken from the FINRA daily data.\n\n**Assumptions used:**\n\nGME Float Stock: 54,490,000 (this is more pessimistic than some reports of only 45M)\n\nGME Total Shares: 69,750,000\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/2lpie1wm12k61.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=450f545a8b2e00b3876d9efc406fba5032fa8a74\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/3jkeam6o12k61.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=a31ac92005edf92bc4ff3180840c376322d3f571\n\nThe FINRA site also now lists GME short % of float at **60.35%** ( [http:\/\/finra-markets.morningstar.com\/MarketData\/EquityOptions\/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&sdkVersion=2.58.0](http:\/\/finra-markets.morningstar.com\/MarketData\/EquityOptions\/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&sdkVersion=2.58.0) ) Thanks to u\/wrek for sending this!\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/jvvu6wat12k61.png?width=449&format=png&auto=webp&s=75eb1ee3899e6bead49611fd2fb68ad380ba4030\n\n\\----------\n\n**Part 2: Borrowing Shares**\n\nTwo other things to note are the decrease in available shorted shares and the increase in fees associated with shorting GME.\n\nThe data available through iborrowdesk.com ([https:\/\/iborrowdesk.com\/report\/GME](https:\/\/iborrowdesk.com\/report\/GME) ). For those wondering about the site, check out the about page; the site uses text files from Interactive Broker\u2019s FTP site ([https:\/\/iborrowdesk.com\/about](https:\/\/iborrowdesk.com\/about) ).\n\nNote: This data does not take into account all available shorts since it is just looking at Interactive Broker, but is a good gauge for how easy it is to get shorts and how much they cost.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/roplc5ly12k61.png?width=1198&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6a592938458cf6436e64ef2655b0bf193bfc6e9\n\nHere we can see that the number of shares available for short selling has gone from **2 million (at 1.1% borrow rate) to only 450,000 at 9% borrow rate**! The last time there were less than 500,000 shares available to borrow and interest rates above 5% (as seen through this site) was on **Jan 27** when we saw some huge intraday price swings.\n\n\\----------\n\n**Part 3: ETFs**\n\nThis data of course doesn't take into account the shorted shares in ETFs that have high stakes in GME.

For all you apes out there all that means is the higher you go, the faster you go higher. This trend started in August. It will likely continue as long as Ryan Cohen and the folks he brought over do good work. Now lets address those large spikes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[January Ape welcoming party, no despair here.](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/x7vxju4trvj61.png?width=3057&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ed649938b25bcb7e461ba4ec794d56bbe72fa33)\n\nSee this, its a classic example of a textbook speculation bubble (dont panic just breathe and read, if you're having trouble go ask your wifes bf to read it out loud for you.)\n\n[See](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/syvpt1m4tvj61.png?width=882&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e65377fc7cfcbd212a6ff8ca714ca330fedf02e)\n\nSo a speculation bubble occurred, but why? What caused it and what does that mean going forward? Especially with the recent activity yesterday and today.\n\nFirstly I am not a financial advisor, and I don't give financial advice.\n\nSecondly to answer is pretty simple this was caused by millions of apes rushing to the stock market to buy GME duh. News goes viral about the squeeze the apes buy, paper hands sell. Ok but that sounds really bad right? Again not necessarily. Bubbles like this happen all the time on all just about anything that can be traded over time scales ranging from a few hours to a few months. One of the things that makes GME such unique opportunity is that there is an incredibly tiny number of available shares relative to its market cap. This important for the squeze but it also means the price is more susceptible to dramatic price fluctuations. In fact it is this property that make a squeeze possible, its the nitrous in your gas that turns it into rocket fuel. Imagine you and all your neighbors are on a life raft in the middle of the ocean and everyday you get 10 gallons of water to share between you that no big deal but what happens when 10 gallons turns to 9 then 8 then 7 and so on. the less water (available shares) the more volatile you and your neighbors get until eventually everything goes MAD MAX and you have all the water to yourself.\n\nso the speculation boils down to....is this the Squeeze? did it squouze? am i too late? So what does that mean for the apes that boarded at 200 250 400. Well nothing the Price is going to jump around a lot and every time it should settle a little bit higher than before, all the while costing the shorts more and more interest, until the squeeze goes off or the market value has reached your cost basis and you're wishing you bought more dip so you could have averaged down and made a profit by now.\n\nAdditionally if you assume the price jump was in fact speculative bubble it means the shorts couldn't really have covered without guaranteeing rocket launch. those arrogant entitled assholes would have had to look in the mirror admit they lost and launch the rocket themselves. OR they could lie to you, and double down. Historically they double down because its not their personal money and the hate being wrong almost as much as they hate losing money\n\nPersonally I don't think the shorts will ever capitulate on their own. I think that it will end in one of 3 ways.\n\n1 SEC will turn up some smoking gun of some kind in an investigation that cant be swept away, and a scapegoat will be offered to the public\n\n2 their clearing house will call their the short positions in and they'll go belly up\n\n3 the shorts are right and we're either too dumb or too distracted to out last them\n\nJust to be clear these are all short term endings. The long term end is basically Cohen and Friends save GAMESTOP and turn it into a digital platform powerhouse, or they don't. They got a pretty good track record though. I mean Chewy sells pet food and toys and its valued at nearly 6 times what GAMESTOP is, don't get me wrong I love my dogs but I spend way more on video games each year than I do on pet food and supplies, and I don't think I'm the only one.\n\nOK, so that covers Jan but what about today and yesterday. Well yeah short answer is I'm not sure, but my best guess is that as a result of some options trading practices someone had to buy a bunch of shares to hedge those options and because the available supply is being restricted by all you apes the price reacted extra sensitively kicking off even more hype. This would be a good sign as it means that the fuel mixture (volatility) is getting super powered and just waiting for the right ignition (catalyst.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Just so you know I where I stand](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/bnps5z3z8wj61.png?width=2409&format=png&auto=webp&s=84d2dc21952c6ff352955f0bb9a2c67035185815)\n\nTL;DR I like the stock.

        "1060":"On GME and index re-balancing. DD from behind a Wendy's. Alright, I know most of you can't read anything longer than a fortune cookie, so I'm putting this right up here at the top:\n\nTL;DR -   \n1. GME market cap goes up  \n2. Index funds end up underweight GME  \n3. They must fix this before May\/June, or losses are locked in  \n4. Tendies   \n\n\nSo I was sucking on the Frosty machine at Wendy's when I decided to look into what it might mean for GME when it moves from the Russell 2000 (small cap) to the Russell 1000 (large cap) in May and June.  This typically doesn't mean much for a single stock, but with the volatility we've seen with GME already, as well as the percentage change in market cap, I think this may be more significant for GME than most companies.\n\nFTSE Russell does a big giant rebanlacing that lasts about two months in May and June.  Link here for the 2020 schedule. [https:\/\/www.ftserussell.com\/press\/ftse-russell-announces-2020-russell-us-indexes-reconstitution-schedule](https:\/\/www.ftserussell.com\/press\/ftse-russell-announces-2020-russell-us-indexes-reconstitution-schedule) .  The 2021 dates aren't released yet but should be basically the same.  Because of the recent run-up in price on GME, it is set for a move from the Russell 2000 to the Russell 1000.  This same price increase also left many active fund managers underweight in GME, and they are losing out on recent gains.\n\nAll of this means Russell 2000 active fund managers who are underweight in GME right now, only have about 2-3 months to attempt to fix it before it gets taken out of the index, and their under performance on GME gets locked in.  It's quite possible that they are helping to form a large part of the floor, and their increasingly desperate attempts to not have the underweight GME locked in at re-balancing time will cause more and more volatility as the deadline approaches.\n\n A recent comparison I would like to make is to TSLA, both because of its retail popularity, short interest, and volatility leading up to SP500 inclusion.  S&P announced that TSLA would be added to the index on Nov. 17, 2020, and it was officially added on Dec. 21. In that time, it's stock price went from $441 to $649, with an overall increase in market cap of over $200 billion dollars.  With a current market cap of around $5-10 Billion dollars depending on the day, it takes a lot less money to move the price on GME, and with the high likelihood of underweight Russell 2000 index funds, we may see even more volatility leading up May\/June than we have so far this year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDisclosure - I am long GME.  This is not financial advice.  I used to work at Wendy's but was fired.",
        "1061":"Simply put, GME is actually extremely undervalued long term. Fellow retards, I might be retarded but I'm just thinking about the future of GME. Ryan Cohen and team turned Chewy into a company worth 40 Billion. Currently trading at 103 a share. Chewy does not have a ton of assets its just an online e-commerce pet store. He beat Amazon out to become the primary pet supply online retailer.\n\nGME actually has real assets, stores all across the country. Imagine what he could do with that. GME 3.8B market cap is absolutely undervalued.\n\nRyan Cohen saw an opportunity with gamestop, to take a dying company and turn it around doing what he ALREADY KNOWS HOW TO DO.\n\nIn short, I like the stock.

Nearly all of these cite https:\/\/iborrowdesk.com\/report\/GME\n\nListen tardy: That's one broker. That's just InteractiveBrokers. It's one of many data points and does not mean much by itself. They could get more available shares because their clients bought GME stock. They could lose available shares because their clients sold GME stock. They could lose available shares because someone borrowed them to short. They could lose available shares because someone asked that their shares not be lent out.\n\nThere are many brokers. There are large \"dark pool\" transactions that do not pass through brokerages. [Fintel](https:\/\/fintel.io\/ss\/us\/gme) is a better source, though their numbers are imperfect as well. \n\nSo yes, keep half an eye on short volume and the number of shares available to short.

        "1063":"How the hedges hoped this would go... For all the new GME investors who might be slightly confused about why and how the hedge funds have gotten themselves backed into this corner..\n\nMelvin and friends thought that GameStop was a failing company, so they decided to short it's stock. They got so greedy, they decided that they would short the company by more stock than actually existed (naked short selling),  such was their confidence that GameStop was worthless.\n\nThe very act of doing this, if it hadn't been discovered might very well have driven Gamestop into bankruptcy, with the company still being viable.\n\nWhen a company goes bankrupt, the short sellers don't haver to buy back or return the stock, so if GameStop had been driven into bankruptcy, this dirty illegal tactic they used might never have been exposed. By not having to buy the stock back, they make maximum profit on their short trade, and don't even have to pay any taxes on their profits. This is a short sellers wet dream.\n\nTens of thousands of people lose their jobs, homes get repossessed, suicides increase, families devastated, all while Melvin and his buddies eat caviar, sip champagne on balconies and count their ill gotten gains. It really is the devil's work what they do.\n\nBut now that the hedgie's devious ways have been exposed and shared with apes allover the world, Melvin and his friends can never drive GameStop into the ground, so they will be forced to buy back the shares at some stage. And because they were so greedy by naked short selling, now they have to buy back more shares than actually exist. They sold fake counterfeit shares, but they need to buy back real shares, the shares we own.\n\nSo even if you only hold 1 share, they need it. They need to buy every single share that actually exists to cover their position. And that is why 1 share of GameStop is worth whatever price you're willing to sell for, even if it's $500k and above.\n\nFor the last few weeks, Melvin and friends have been using even dirtier tactics, trying to fool us all into thinking that they do not need our shares.\n\nDo not fall for this. They will use every psychological tactic they can to convince you to sell. Manipulating the price, turning off the buy button via RobinHood, paying media to say they have already covered etc. They are going to be using even dirtier tactics over the coming weeks,  some that we haven't event thought of yet.\n\nAll we need to do is hold ; nothing else, and get on with life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs an Irish Ape, I will finish by sharing an Irish patriotic saying..\n\n\"*Tiocfaidh Ar La - Our Day will Come\"*",
        "1064":"DON'T SELL AT A LOSS. (some advice on fundamentals for new traders) Well, what I consider \u201cfundamentals\u201d anyway. I've continually edited this post as people raise valid points in the comments. Please be constructively critical! I'm learning too. I was getting imposter syndrome from this post until I realized I'm only an imposter if I present myself as a professional. I'm no stock guru, I am just gorilla whom like the stock, and I felt compelled to post some important fundamentals I wasn't seeing in this subreddit. Respect to those on WSB who just want to do wild gambles, but this is relevant to GME\/AMC. Anyway...\n\n\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83e\udd8dhere. I wrote some basic advice I'll repost here for any newbies who want to get in on the action, or anyone who bought high and is for whatever dumb reason thinking about paper-handing. Paper-handing is fundamentally bad investment practice, especially if you're a new investor. I'll explain why.\n\n*DISLAIMER: I've only been trading for a few years and I only know this shit because I have a mentor in finance who taught me this stuff, and he hasn\u2019t steered me wrong yet. So take it for what it\u2019s worth... But based on all the fact that paper-handing is even an issue here, you apes clearly need this advice.* ***EDIT: These are \"fundamentals\" to the way I trade, but obviously everyone's trading strategy is different. Note that this is a quantitative approach to investing, which doesn't encourage YOLO-ing. This is ONE WAY to invest which does not require you to \"outsmart\" the general public by spotting opportunities\/value before the market does. Now personally, I like GME and AMC... I just like the way the letters look when I pull up my portfolio. This trading strategy is particularly relevant to those stocks, but is also relevant to the stock of any established, large company. The ticker symbol is less important than what you do with it. There are countless other approaches to trading (which often require more experience) but I feel this is most accessible to new investors. GME is the hot stock right now but this applies to everything. Well, everything that you don\u2019t think will go bankrupt or get delisted.***\n\n**New traders, or people who are thinking of becoming new traders, should read this.** Especially if you're new, I think you should follow these guidelines to avoid losing serious money in the stock market. This applies to all stock, not just GME. (edit: sorry if at any point I\u2019m making it sound like this is the definitive way to trade. My bad. Everyone\u2019s strategy is different, but this works well if you\u2019re patient, not emotional about it and would rather pay in \u201copportunity cost\u201d than losing money. If you\u2019re worried about opportunity cost, invest less!) Since a friend of a friend told me he paper-handed on GME (sold the dip), I feel compelled to explain why what he did was a bad idea.\n\n**I would encourage people to buy the stocks they like, but only with money you are willing to say goodbye to for a while.** (edit: in addition, just to reiterate, keep plenty of money in reserve so you can buy more if the stock goes down) By this I mean **NEVER SELL AT A LOSS**. Simply hold or buy more to bring your cost average down. All newbie investors (IMO) should adhere to this rule just in general. Buy stock prepared to ride it into the ground, or don\u2019t buy it at all.\n\nMany investors, myself included, follow this rule religiously with all stocks. I have never lost money in the stock market because I never sold at a loss, I just held or bought more. COVID crashed the market while my portfolio was maxed out? I just held and was fine... should have bought more. If everyone purchasing a heavily shorted stock bought in with this mindset, I bet it would go to Pluto easily.\n\nNow let's say you're buying a heavily shorted stock... if you sell at a loss, you are donating to the \"save the short sellers\" fund out of your own wallet, fucking yourself over and betraying your fellow apes, and you\u2019re not even following sound investment practice. Just chain yourself to that rocket and enjoy. If you\u2019re thinking of investing so much that you\u2019ll wuss out, poop your diaper and smash the sell button with shaking paper hands at the slightest hint of red... just don\u2019t. Emotion and the stock market do not mix well.\n\nStop losses (below purchase price) are also for pansies and genuine idiots. \u201cI\u2019ll sell you some stock... but only if you give me a bad enough price on it.\u201d Your plan should be to BUY when the stock goes down... if you feel like you need a stop loss below cost basis, you're probably investing more than you should. Instead of being stupid, maybe try investing less and keep money in reserve so you can buy the dips. (edit: I'm sure there are experienced value investors to whom these types of orders are valuable, but for the average ape who cannot assess the value of a stock, they're generally just to hedge a gamble of more money than you probably should have invested to begin with. Personally, I like strategies that allow me to make money even if the stock goes down.)\n\nSide note: personally, in the case of a stock with a potential short squeeze, I don\u2019t have any limit sells either. From what I can tell on past short squeezes, the price seems to go parabolic for at least half a day before coming back down. So as long as you keep an eye on it when it actually does skyrocket, you should have plenty of time. Set price alerts and relax. No need to shoot yourself in the foot by ditching the rocket mid-launch. (Some in the comments have brought up that you can use a trailing stop exit strategy. This is cool, and especially good if you can't watch it! But for example, if you place a 20% trailing stop, make sure you're 20% up when it gets placed!)\n\nAlthough, if you want you can try to profit off volatility on the WSB favorites. Some people are getting shamed for taking profits but I'm not sure they deserve it. As far as I know, buying low and selling high doesn\u2019t really help HFs, it drives the price up (just not as much as buying and holding). But personally, my philosophy is, I can take baby profits anytime... who knows when these opportunities will come around again. I'll note my positions, which are admittedly small, because I follow my own advice on not overinvesting. These are just the stocks I personally like: 101 GME averaging $106\/share, 1000 AMC averaging $11.07\/share.\n\nWant to get into the game now? You could always just buy a few shares, and keep the rest of what you\u2019re willing to invest in reserve in case of a dip. And buy a little bit more each time it goes down more, bringing your cost average down. Ideally, you should always have a loose plan for how much you will buy at each phase if the stock goes down to near zero. Always try to keep cash in reserve.\n\nLocked yourself in at a high price? That's why you keep cash in reserve so you can buy the dip and average down. Didn't keep any cash in reserve? Guess you're stuck waiting for one of three things: 1) the short squeeze which will likely (though not certainly) happen in the case of GME, 2) for the price of the stock to rise naturally over years as the value of the company increases, or 3) you get your hands on some more cash you're willing to say goodbye to bring your cost average down. **DO NOT SELL AT A LOSS** and you will never lose (edit: well, seldom, if ever. Unless the company goes bankrupt, a rare occurrence. This is why you don't put all your eggs in one basket, and plan so even if you buy all the way down to zero, it won't swallow your portfolio. Also, if you truly fucked up and used money that you need for health insurance or something, you may just have to back at least partially out with your tail between your legs and consider it a lesson). Hedge funds and billionaires know this, that's why their wealth increased so dramatically during the pandemic. They bought the dip while regular folks paper-handed and got even poorer.\n\nOne more little trick. If you manage to scoop up a nice juicy 100 shares, then even if your position goes \u201cunderwater,\u201d you can always sell covered calls at above your average cost, bring DOWN your cost basis, and make money off your stock \u201crisk free\u201d while still following the rule of never sell at a loss. Make sure they are covered, i.e. you hold onto the actual stock for the duration of the call, otherwise it\u2019s actually extremely risky. Although if you sold even a covered call on certain WSB favorites right this second the risk would be missing out on a once in a lifetime historic short squeeze. Bear in mind though it may take months for the squeeze to actually happen, and you'll need to be patient and, like I said before, say goodbye to your money for a while. *\"The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient.\" -Warren Buffet*\n\n**EDIT:** Just to reiterate, there are many trading strategies and I just feel this is one of the best for newbies. Trade however you want, just know that if you paper hand GME\/AMC at a loss, you're screwing yourself and others who bought the stock. I would also note that you *can* sell some shares below your cost basis and still follow this rule, if your sell is paired with a buy order that you executed at a lower price. It still follows the rule of \"don't sell at a loss.\" Buy one share at $90 and sell it at $100, doesn't matter if you still have 100 shares in the red from earlier. You can even (slowly) take your cost basis down by doing the thing where you buy a share when it goes down 5%, and sell one when it goes up 5%.\n\n**EDIT:** Yes I know about opportunity cost. It does apply if you know something the general public doesn\u2019t (rare if you\u2019re just a low IQ ape like me but recent WSB favorites are an exception). Many traders make money hopscotching between stocks regardless of loss but unless you know something the market doesn't, it could be a coin flip whether you'll hit rock bottom. In an ideal world, you can keep some money in reserve so you don\u2019t have to realize losses to jump on new opportunities. Yes I know about (and agree with) the sunk cost fallacy. My point is about gradually buying as the stock depreciates and becomes a better deal, lowering the cost basis, not \u201cdoubling down\u201d on sunk cost.\n\nTl;dr \ud83e\udd8dbuy \ud83c\udf4c, don\u2019t give \ud83d\udc0d \ud83c\udf4c unless \ud83d\udc0d give more than \ud83e\udd8dpay for \ud83c\udf4c\n\nNot financial advice, and definitely not good financial advice.

The blatant lie that Melvin Capital, during the Gamestop hearing, admitted to not closing out their short position on Gamestop. This is not true. Now, I am going to assume whoever came up with this lie, did it as a *valiant* effort to help boost the price of Gamestop, and probably hoped no one would call them out on their BS, because nobody else decided to waste their time, watching a 5+ hour congressional hearing about stocks. Those are about the two most boring things in the world, combined. But, you don't even have to get that far into the hearing to call this lie out for the BS that it is. In Melvin Capital's opening statement, within the first minute of it, they state they closed out of their short positions in GME days before any restrictions were put on it. You can look up videos of the opening statements, yourself. I won't baby you that much. So, in conclusion, don't rely on the scenario that Melvin never closed out their short positions. It's a lie and it needs some water doused on it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. Scenario Two, possibly the most believed strategy on GME Thursday\/Friday: \"Keeping the price over **(insert dollar amount here),** by Friday close, makes **(insert number here)** of calls ITM, and when they cover, the price is going to rocket!\" Now, I am not going to say this scenario is impossible, but it is not very likely, and it is what got many people burned the last time. Yes, it is true, keeping the price over a certain price, making a lot of calls ITM, can be good for the stock... **IF** those calls aren't covered calls, which I believe that almost all of them are. The week ending Jan. 22nd, there are probably a lot of naked calls. That hurt the sellers, bad, when GME closed at a very high price. Nobody expected it. That helped it a lot the following week when we saw the big spike. But then, let's run down what happened that following week. Yes, RH restricted buying on Thursday, 28th, which I do believe stopped the biggest of the squeezed, but it would not have played a role in the ineffectiveness of the \"Calls ITM\" strategy that followed. That Thursday, the price plummeted into the $200s. That Friday, you heard a lot of chatter of ***\"As long as we can get the stock up to $310, a lot of calls will be ITM and we will be golden, my fellow apes! Get it to $320 and that's bonus points. That will be 90k calls that will be ITM and have to cover. That's 9 MILLION SHARES!\"*** And yeah, A lot of that was true. There were 90k calls that would be ITM if we closed above $320. And you know what we did? We closed above $320. We closed around $328, in fact. This was it. Come Monday, that price was going to the moon. *\"10k isn't a meme!\"* We chanted. We couldn't be wrong. We did the maths. We had the DD. Diamonds don't crack, baby! Well, come Monday, there was no lift off. It was the Space Shuttle Columbia all over again. The stock fell, and it fell hard. Going back into the low $200s, dipping into the $100s even, before closing in the $200s. That's okay though. That's fine. They had until Wednesday to *actually* close on those Calls, you'd hear. So Tuesday came and went. Then Wednesday too. We never saw $300 again. In fact, by Friday, we were barely even seeing $100. So what happened? What went wrong? We had maths **AND** anime on our side. Well, what I believe happened is, those Call contract sellers learned their lesson that first week that ended Jan. 22nd, when they got screwed. They didn't let their calls be naked the following week. They bought up GME stocks when it was low at the beginning of that week, if they didn't already have them. This allowed them to resell those stocks at $320 and under, making them the big winners in all of this. But that meant these weren't NEW stocks that would help us go higher. No, these were stocks bought on the way up. They helped us peak but wouldn't help us go ***over*** the peak. So, when those calls executed, there were suddenly a lot of new holders of GME stock. Holders who saw their stocks were worth $300-$320. These weren't diamond handers, like you or I. These apes wanted their bananas ***NOW.*** So they sold when they got them. Gotta cash in those profits at some point. As WSB loves saying \"*You can't lose if you don't sell\"*. Well, you also can't win if you don't sell. So now flash forward a month later, and the same theory is being pushed. \"*Keep the price over $100 and we will rocket to $800 come Monday. No, scratch that, $1000. No, wait, even better. $69,420!\"* You hear in the echo chamber, bouncing off the walls like GME does in the first 30 minutes of market open. That's not going to happen. These are covered calls that are ITM. You're not forcing anyone to buy new stocks at the current price. You are just buying stocks for $50-$100 that were already bought at $40-$60 and are keeping the stock price stagnant. And none of this is even mentioning that the amount of ITM calls this time is like a third of what it was last time. So, do not rely on this strategy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. Scenario Three: *\"tHeY hAvE tO cOveR. tHeN wE cAn sEt oUR oWn pRicE\"*. This is probably the most ignorant reason, and is why I typed it out like that. Yeah, I'm mocking you. Get over it. it is true, they do have to cover eventually. But not with your stocks. GME short interest is somewhere around 45-50% (too lazy to relook up the actual number), and this is after new reports showed 1.3 million more shares were shorted on Wednesday. Now, yes, that is a high amount of short interest. But that isn't high enough for the **\"Diamond Hands\"** approach. There's still 50ish percent of shares out there, not shorted. And yes, Diamond Handers hold a lot of those, most are going to be held by institutions and those institutions are about the money, not the message. They see a 3x profit? They sell. They sell to whoever is willing to buy. Could be more Diamond Handers, could be hedge funds. But eventually, Apes are going to run out of money to buy and hold with. That's when the Hedge Funds can swoop in, buy up these stocks, cover their short positions. The people they borrowed from might not be Diamond Handers, and end up selling to more Hedge Funds. When the short interest is only around 50%, you can't win with the Buy\/Hold strategy. When the short interest is 50%, the short squeeze happens and you don't know it happens until it is over and the Hedge Funds have covered. You win by riding the wave up as Hedge Funds cover and then you get out near the top. That's the end of your ride. The ride doesn't just keep going up. You can only set the price when you own most of the market, and in this case, we don't. And on top of all of that, you also have people who are doing this with their bill money. The 1st of the month is coming up, that's a lot of rent needing paid. No shame in needing to sell so you can pay your bills. But, that's more shares that will flood the market. Probably a fraction of the actual amount of shares out there, but pennies add up to dollars eventually.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd those are the three scenarios in which you have a higher chance of losing than winning. Again, I cannot stress this enough: I **DO** believe a short squeeze can happen with GME. But I do not believe it is any of these three scenarios that will make it happen. I'm just tired of seeing people being fed these these  delusional optimistic claims that throw truth, history, and **REAL** DD & common sense out the window, treating GME more like a PnD than an actual short squeeze.  it's okay to drink the Kool-aid, but maybe check to make sure it isn't spiked first.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I've been trying to reply to as many people as I can. If they took their time to indulge me, read  my post, and then spend their time writing a rebuttal to it, I wanted to respect that and give them a proper response, but it's getting a bit tiring and I have other things to do, so I will not be replying to any further comments. I might keep going with the fun conversations, but for the rest, I will not be.",
        "1067":"Really long DD and Analysis! What happened yesterday explained in detail and exposing the HFs obvious manipulation. Good morning everyone, this is an important update to what happened yesterday!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst of all: I made a prediction in my post yesterday . The prediction would've become reality, if Hedgies didn't overshort with fake shares (more about that in a second). Why do I tell you this? I literally received death threats and insults when the market ended. Just a heads up: Those are PREDICTIONS, they can be faulty at times, especially when Hedgies do such unexpected things, that no Data can predict (again, more about that in a second). So please, for the love of god, don't harass me, insult me, or send me death threats when something like that happens. I understand your frustration, but don't target me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow the juicy stuff; **What exactly happened yesterday? Here is a timeline:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**9:35 AM:** The market opened and we had a huge drop off in price and a HUGE spike in volume. Hedgefunds shorted over 18,363,000 Shares (over the first 5 minutes. The amount of shorting was so aggressive, that trading got halted twice within the first minutes.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/w8qgdhc52tj61.png?width=1174&format=png&auto=webp&s=312ade6cbbff842f8f1c2b85707b9ee414bc5af4\n\n**9:45 AM TO 1:50 PM**: Trading pretty much went in our favor the whole time, people kept buying in, we hit the daily high of $185 at around 1PM and went sideways for almost 1 hour after that\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/y22hod9b2tj61.png?width=622&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfc15d4f0d31ef8a0f2f1ebfaa90c412711b4b22\n\n**1:55PM**: Shit gets interesting. Really aggressive shorting for the second time that day brings the price down to $126. At that point in time, between 5,000,000 and 7,000,000 shares were shorted in the blink of an eye. What stood out for me at that point in time is, that the price kept going in the same direction after every short attack (between $100 and $125). That tells me, it was really important to get the price down in that direction. (more in a few seconds)\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/osl59mnb2tj61.png?width=525&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfb0f9aa432f6ca45348aa39708ba4786f6f6572\n\n**2PM TO 3:25PM**: People buying in again, driving the price up to $140 - $150. And Now shit gets juicy.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ha1vws1c2tj61.png?width=1049&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd0bd0a7e87335c977ce9581b3a19ef335e37c31\n\n**3:30PM TO 4:00PM**: The 3rd aggressive short attack begins and keeps on going for 30 minutes, until the market closes. 10,000,000 shares were shorted in this time span.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/7hp3ktgc2tj61.png?width=1177&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4c655e876c22f10194d1e86c2e8c0edfe03e787\n\nNOW THE ANALYSIS:\n\n**WHERE DID THEY GET SO MANY SHARES TO SHORT GME AND WHY WAS IT NOT PREDICTABLE?**\n\nSo, how could no one forsee this? It's simple: Hedgefunds didn't borrow shares to short, they created them out of thin air. When the market opened yesterday, ALL available $GME Shares to borrow, were gone already (see my second edit from yesterday:  **EDIT2 (10AM): 0 SHORTS AVAILABLE FOR $GME RIGHT NOW. THEY BORROWED OVER 2,100,000 SHARES TO SHORT FOR YESTERDAY AND TODAY**! ([https:\/\/fintel.io\/ss\/us\/gme](https:\/\/fintel.io\/ss\/us\/gme); [https:\/\/iborrowdesk.com\/report\/GME](https:\/\/iborrowdesk.com\/report\/GME)) What does this mean? Well, no one can predict or analyse how deep they are digging their grave right now, because they are not using real shares to short GME. They can just keep doing it in order to hold the price down artificially.\n\n**WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE ADD UP TO SHORTS AND PRICE DIPS MENTIONED ABOVE?**\n\nNow it just gets stupidly funny and obvious. If we add up the three big short attacks (18,363,000 right at opening, 5,000,000 to 7,000,000 at noon and about 10,000,000 right before close), we get 33,363,000 shares sold short over the day. Why is this funny and obvious? Check the latest FINRA report. It states that yesterday more than 33,000,000 were sold short. That's almost exactly the number that we get when we add up the volume of the dips.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/d3vuakyd2tj61.png?width=453&format=png&auto=webp&s=494fb1b56197d7d997e2c0abdd2843f7bd538bcb\n\n**WHY DID THEY SHORT GME SO AGGRESSIVELY WITH FAKE SHARES?**\n\nBecause bears are fuk. See, when GME would've closed in between $115 and $150, over 44.000 Call options would've become ITM. If exercised, that would've driven up the price AH\/PRE or today in the high hundreds, maybe even thousands. Why is that so bad? The higher the price gets, the more calls get exercised (so called options chain), the more people jump in because of FOMO and we get closer to the magical $800 mark, where the MOASS would become inevitable this or next week.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/3djwn1de2tj61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ce4f2b20c430b672e8d4a5701c39c327f368e7b\n\n**WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THIS LOOKING FORWARD?**\n\nHedgies don't give a single fuck anymore. Even when all the data available states, that there are no more shorts available to borrow for GME, we found all of their ETFs where they hid their shorts, they keep shorting it to try and stop the MOASS. You know what they say: There is nothing more dangerous than an animal that's trapped in a corner and's got nothing to lose anymore. That's what we're seeing right now. No one can give accurate predictions anymore, that is based on data. This has evolved into a game of poor greed and emotions. They don't care about the long term results of their illegal actions, they just want to save their asses for some more weeks or even just days.\n\nIN SHORT: BE PREPARED FOR EVERYTHING, DON'T BE SCARED OF DIPS, THEY ARE MORE THAN LIKELY CREATED ARTIFICIALLY BY HIGHLY ILLEGAL SHORTING WITH FAKED SHARES!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR:** Hedgies are so fucked, that they just shorted GME with more than 33,000,000 non-existent shares yesterday, keeping the price down in order to stop the Gamma Squeeze from happening. The price would've jumped up to a few hundred, maybe even thousand dollars today if they didn't do it, which would've started the real squeeze today. They have nothing to lose anymore, so be prepared for more highly illegal action and don't get scared by fake dips!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT(1PM EUROPEAN TIME**): According to this site ([http:\/\/shortvolumes.com\/?t=GME](http:\/\/shortvolumes.com\/?t=GME)), the short sale volume was 61 % percent yesterday, with a **short sale volume of 50,959,384. That doesn't mean that Hedgies opened 51 Million new short positions. I am being really conservative and sticking to the 33,000,000. If it's more than that, even better!**\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/lmtsuxki0uj61.png?width=830&format=png&auto=webp&s=785f8991b72d084e264f5174ac446e619988b8bf\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT2: TO ALL THE PEOPLE WANTING UNDERSTAND NAKED SHORTING \/ COUNTERFEITING STOCKS, HERE IS A GREAT READ:** [http:\/\/counterfeitingstock.com\/CounterfeitingStock.html#:\\~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit](http:\/\/counterfeitingstock.com\/CounterfeitingStock.html#:~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit).\n\nQuote: \" **Naked Short** \u2014 This is an invention of the securities industry that is a license to create counterfeit shares. In the context of this document, a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company, is considered counterfeit. This is not a legal conclusion, since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon today's rules. The alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market, but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares, which leads to widespread stock manipulation \u2013 the lynchpin of this massive fraud.\n\nReturning to our example, everything is the same except the part about borrowing the share from someone else's account: There is no borrowed share \u2014 instead a new one is created by either the broker dealer or the DTC. Without a borrowed share behind the short sale, a naked short is really a counterfeit share.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT3(9:30AM): THE FEE TO BORROW GME SHARES WENT UP BY 12 % OVER NIGHT AND IS THEREFORE IN THE DOUBLE DIGITS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 4 WEEKS (**[**https:\/\/iborrowdesk.com\/report\/GME**](https:\/\/iborrowdesk.com\/report\/GME)**)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT4: How do I know that it was Hedgies and not Retail selling their shares?  It is possible, that some retail traders sold, but if you take a look at the Short volume (61 % yesterday with 51,000,000 shares being sold short) and then take a look at the overall sell volume, it doesn't add up. If there was a huge retail sell off and the additional 61 % short volume, the price drop would've been much much bigger. Most retail held through, therefore they had to aggressively keep shorting, because no one was selling.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT5: I am preparing my next DD right now and HOLY SHIT. Yesterdays actions fit right into the pieces and I can give a date for the Squeeze to take place (ALMOST certain, but I don't want to make false promises, so please take it with a grain of salt!), because lots of different pieces fit together for that exact date. If I am able to finish it today, I'll link it here as well! This actually feels like a conspiracy theory, because everything happening right now points to that specific date making it feel too easy to be true.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Another edit to blueball you guys even more**: The crazy last-minute drive up of the price 2 days ago and the drop off yesterday and today were foreseeable in hindsight. Again connecting to that specific date. But that's just a theory, a Game(stop) theory! Just makes this whole shit crazier than it already is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUPDATE: I HAVE ALL THE DATA.  YOU CAN'T MAKE UP HOW CRAZY THIS SHIT IS. LOOKING FORWARD TO THE MOVIE! **THE ENDGAME DD IS BEING RELEASED TOMORROW @ 3PM EST \/ 9PM CET.** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI keep trying to look for more Data and update this post! If I made some mistakes or missed something, feel free to tell me so I can keep you all up to date!",
        "1068":"Which is smoke and mirrors? So, I keep running scenarios through my head. I\u2019m trying to understand why GME and AMC spiked 100\u2019s % points a few weeks ago and then trading very similar to each to each other and both made moves this week. Is GME still the ONLY play here or is AMC the ugly sister that you\u2019ll have sex with to make the hotter sister jealous but you\u2019re going to enjoy it either way?\n\nMedia and forum group AMC and GME in every message or hit piece so I\u2019m worried AMC is just smoke and mirrors and GME is still the real play here. I\u2019m heavy into AMC with no stake in GME based on the DD I\u2019ve seen all over that AMC is going to squeeze hard just Probably not to the same level as GME because of a lot of reasons. AMC short interest is still very high and sketchy things around that data is going on.\n\nWhat are your apes opinions? Are you only GME or both AMC and GME? Is AMC a diversion or do they just want us to think that it is? Could AMC be the real opportunity now that GME already went to $480? Or are they both huge opportunities because hedge fuck hedge funds?",
        "1069":"GME, WHAT WILL HAPPEN TODAY? (from a NEWBIE, for the NEWBIES) *DISCLAIMER:*\n\n*1) I am NOT a professional investor, this post can be pure dumbshit, do your researches, never listen to apes.*\n\n*2) I am NOT a professional investor, as for the professionals PLEASE don't start \"oh, we're saying this stuff from weeks\", \"oh, were you asleep?\" and so on. This post is for the newbie and or for the confused one. You PRO's forget it.*\n\n**AND SO... WHAT'S THIS GME STUFF TODAY?**\n\nFirst thing first: don't want to start a flame but... please STOP with this \"WE\" are taking GME to the moon. \"WE\" are not even taking GME to MC Donald's. Market are for big investors, the \"whales\". The \"normal\" people, those who buy 1, 10, 50 shares, simply doesn't have the \"force\" to move substantially the price of this share. Look at the book, there are entities buying and selling MOTHERLOADS of shares, I mean MILLIONS of $$$ like peanuts. These are the ones moving the price, not US. \"WE\" can help this, indeed, following the \"thrust\" when some whales decide to move a stock high or to sink it.\n\nSo the point is trying to speculate for the next move of the BIG PLAYERS, in order to eat some crumbs. But don't get depressed, for ape-birds, crumbs are LIFE.\n\nOK, but wasn't GME dead? Weren't the hedge founds out?\n\nIMO it's not a matter of hedge founds and short selling, it's a matter of OPTIONS. (if you don't know how options works start from here [https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/o\/option.asp](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/o\/option.asp) )\n\nToday February 26th, a lot of options expire, both calls and puts.\n\n**BUT**\n\nThere is a an imbalance towards the call ones, AKA there was a lot more of money in calls (so betting that GME would rise) than in puts (so betting GME would fall).\n\n**FACTS ENDING, SPECULATION STARTING**\n\nFebruary 23rd there was A HUGE selling in crypt0 currencies. I mean some people sold MILLIONS and MILLIONS and MILLIONS of crypt0s, in the middle of the greatest bull run of them all... STRANGE.\n\nThe very next day, someone, at 3:00 PM starts to resurrect an almost dead GME buying LOTS and LOTS of shares. Obviously, the one that have bought all these put options started to short GME in order to keep the price low, but NO: MR.X then places SHITLOAD of money and GME rises from $50 to $90 in just an hour. EVEN MORE STRANGE.\n\nI think that MR.X (that can or cannot be a single investor, maybe is a group of investors, maybe a whale, even a foreign country, who knows) decided to move all his crypt0 reserve in order to protect his huge investiment in GME calls.\n\n**SOUNDS GOOD.. GO ON!**\n\nNow, guess what... this night the crypt0 markets sank another time. Someone sold a LOT of coins... And today the option are expiring... do your math.\n\nI think that Mr.X will RISE GME today, at any cost.\n\n**OK, so GME to the MOON? ...but HOW far is the moon?**\n\nLet's look at the option chain: the big numbers (more than 10000 volume) are at these prices:\n\nCALLS: 150, 200, 250, 300, 400, 500, 800\n\nPUTS: 100, 50, 40\n\nThere are basically two forces: one that wants GME to stay OVER 150, better over 300, ideally over 800; one that wants GME to stay under 100, better under 50, ideally under 40.\n\n**NICE. SO WHAT WILL HAPPEN TODAY?**\n\nWell, maybe nothing.\n\nBut if someone start SHARPLY to buy loads of GME, and you see the price going 150, 200, 250, I bet it will continue to buy in order to reach 300. Then if the market \"feels\" the momentum, maybe it could reach 400 or 500. It's very difficult but not impossible reaching 800. But over 800 today... I don't think it will really happen.\n\nOtherwhise, if GME sinks UNDER 100, it will remain there. There is a remote possibility that will go down to 50, maybe 40, but not less than that.\n\n**MY HEAD HURTS. IT'S ALL SO COMPLICATED.**\n\nAs a matter of fact, it is EXTREMELY more complicated and unpredictable. Don't forget that in the game there are also the short sellers and the market makers... so everything could happen.\n\nBy the way... today CAN be an interesting day for GME... or maybe not?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT:** *at 6:30 AM EST the premarket is only +8,85%. IF someone wants to climb it up to the BIG numbers, will start buying BIG just at the opening. Otherwise you could hope for a pre-closing rally to reach 200,250,300 but not more. That's because of market halts (LULD), if would be impossible to push it to let's say 800 in only a couple hours, that would (maybe) need a full day of market halts and restarts.*\n*at 11:00 AM EST is floating around 125. IMO there's no time to reach 800 today. If rally starts, aim towards 250 \/ 300.",
        "1070":"Do your own thing, but don't forget where you came from GME is special. Something this good isn't going to happen very often, but it will happen again... sometime.\n\nA little calculus or watching an interview with someone like Drukenmiller will inform you that it only takes a certain number of people getting out  to move the market enough to the sell side, thus removing  the needed support under a price.\n\nI'm not saying it will be a collapse of course; only that the collective buying, continued holding -- any tightly held stock enjoys being expensive to buy  -- and the special stuff a group of inspired people coming together creates, is what will guarantee GME  at or above $300.\n\nWhat I am saying is that looking for what will be the next great thing, will not find another GME, for now. Things like this tend to happen once and quite spectacularly, but almost never come in twos or threes. YMMV, and there's more money to be made as a retard.\n\nDISCLAIMER:  I'm just saying.  I bought 1 GME share yesterday, and lost 30% between the open and close, and figured as much; I'm now happy to be a part of this.  I have for a while, and continue only holding some amount of gold, for now.\n\nMy contention, is if you're long enough GME, you will, in that time probably watch the company do an offering  of as little  as 50M ordinary shares for up to $2B equity, or perhaps raise enough cash   on the back of a fuck-ton of the kind of  advertising you can't buy; like what Elon did at Tesla.  With enough cash to execute the e-commerce strategy, and transition to online, you might find that GameStop was in fact a $200 or $300 company.  This would be the true story of the company.\n\nMy point, is that you might do just as well to keep doing the same thing, and holding the line.\n\nThis is not any kind of advice of course, just someone's perspective. People should make up their own mind.\n\nNote: This is a repost from back when we were above $300.  Idk why it was deleted.",
        "1071":"Another hypothesis on GME mid-week spike and major stock price drops Backstory:  First of all I want to thank everyone for their contributions in the  GME scandal. We truly stand on the shoulders of giants at this moment.  We accomplished way more than expected. So much excellent DD has  uncovered so many things and taught millions of people the inner  workings of Wall Street. Who would've thought a collective hive mind of  retail investors could compile a dossier of due diligence comparable to  the greatest teams of analysts at Citadel? Not me. But it happened  anyway. So here we are, 2021. Bigger than ever. Smarter than ever. More  learned than the learned learnest of the learned. Here's my small  contribution.\n\nThere are 2 types of  pressure on GME at the moment. One is from the shorts and one is from  the major shareholders selling options. Here's how their interests play  out:\n\nThe options sellers are  people who own the stocks and they want those options to expire  worthless. This gives rise to the Max Pain theorem. The Max Pain theorem  puts the optimal price for GME at $48 for options expiring 2-26-2021 so  the options sellers will try to get it down to that so they can  maximize their profits. You can verify this here: swaggy stocks site or some other-can't post link\n\nMeow,  the short sellers want the stock to go down on days when they don't  have to compete with options sellers, which is basically Monday through  Thursday. They have to be careful to not drop it below 10% in one day so  they don't trigger the short-sale-rule and get shorting halted. They  also have to be careful to keep it going in a direction that the Max  Pain price keeps adjusting downward every week so they don't have to  spend extra money fighting the options sellers.\n\nThe  naked short sellers, like Melvin Capital, learned their lesson in the  last squeeze and are now buying calls in case their shorts get into  trouble by a squeeze. So here's where the interests of the two types of  pressure collide. The shorts want cheap calls and the call sellers want  expensive calls that expire worthless.\n\nBefore  I get to the hypothesis, I want to mention something. I haven't seen  this mentioned so let me explain how dark pools and market manipulation  work. Hedge funds buy GME stocks from each other outside of the stock  market at a pre-arranged price(probably market close or whatever) so  that they don't change the market price and keep the volume low on the  market. Then it's much easier for them to manipulate the market with  it's low volume because they have a lot of buying power and can send  large orders through the market to change the price while doing all  their shorting\/covering in their dark pools.\n\nNow  that you know the forces at play, there is a way they could make even  more money. They could move the market up significantly any day other  than Friday and then let it fall back down on Friday and if it doesn't  go down enough, the options sellers will force it there. They make money  on they way up and on the way down buying and selling stocks and  options from retail investors. And by Occam's razor, this would make the  most sense.\n\nAs for the broader economy stock price drops, we all know real interest rates changed and some people decided to take profits from stocks and move to safer havens. We also know there is a sector rotation from indoorsy pandemic stocks to outdoorsy pandemic-is-over stocks. It isn't hedge funds covering GME shorts. They have calls for that.\n\nTLDR: Hypothesizzle: The mysterious run up of GME was orchestrated to steal ape money.\n\nPositions: $0 GME <-think about that\n\nInB4 Straw man \"Your post history suggests you're a shill...\" get over yourself, Yes or no ?\n\nInB4  Appeal to authority \"What makes you an expert? You don't know anything\"  This is a hypothesis. Prove it wrong or move along. Hang in there\n\nInB4  Appeal to doubt\/fear\/FOMO \"paper hands\/pussy\/HODL\" If you like the  stock, I'm happy for you. If you're flinging options like crazy, I fear  for you. I could be wrong and we'll see tomorrow but we should maintain  discipline and entertain all possibilities. I know 30% short interest is  extremely large and subject to squeeze. I know that number may be  manipulated(downward in this case). I believe hedge funds have calls to  cover their shorts.\n\nRemindme! 10 hours\n\nYou can have your damn time",
        "1072":"Game Theory 101: why WSB will lose its tendies trying to squeeze stuff. Discussion \ud83d\ude80 GAMESTOP TO $130,000. SEE YOU IN THE KUIPER BELT!\n\n**Alright, listen up** **you damn dirty apes**\\*\\*. I'm going to walk you through why these attempted short squeezes are just a recipe to get your faces ripped off. I'm going to use bold on the important stuff so you'll read it before you see a banana or something shiny.\\*\\*\n\nThis monkey troop is an un-coordinated mess. To channel Henry Kissinger, \u201cWho do I call if I want to speak to [r\/WallStreetBets](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/WallStreetBets\/)?\u201d That's good for legal compliance, but let me explain to you why it will also prevent you from turning your memes into dreams.\n\n**1)** **The Prisoners' Dilemma** is a game theory classic. There are two prisoners who allegedly committed a crime together. If both prisoners snitch on each other, they'll both go to jail for a medium amount of time. If both prisoners keep quiet, it will be hard to prove they did anything wrong and they'll only go to jail for a little while. If one prisoner snitches but the other prisoner stays quiet, the prisoner who didn't snitch gets the book thrown at them and goes to jail for a long, long time.\n\nThis is the position the WSB diamond hands gang is in. If none of you sell, the stock moons. If all of you sell, the stock gets nuked. If some apes sell and other apes don't, the ones who sell make money and the ones who don't get caca shoved down their throats. **Each monkey on WSB has a strong incentive to have hands that are just a little bit less diamond than all the other monkeys' hands.**\n\n**2) Recursion. Let us assume for a moment that every monkey in this troop decides that GME really is going to $1,000.** **Every monkey thinks that when GME hits $1k, all the other monkeys will sell and then the price will crash.**\n\n**Smart monkeys will see the $1,000 top coming.** **They'll use their prehensile tails to enter sell orders at $999.** But then they'll realize that other monkeys will probably do the same thing, meaning GME's peak will really be at **$999**. So monkeys get a little smarter, and enter a sell order at **$998.** But now GME's only going to peak at $998, so monkeys enter sell orders for **$997. The same logic leads us to sell orders at $996, then $995, then $994, and all the way down to a more reasonable valuation.** The squeeze never gets squoze.\n\n**3) Why was Volkswagen different?** You've heard breathless accounts of how the VW shorts called up Porsche crying and begging for relief. Don't wait for Melvin to call all 4 million of us begging for a deal. Porsche bought up a huge chunk of VW stock. Porsche was the only prisoner; it wasn't going to snitch on itself. Porsche didn't have a recursion problem. **Porsche was an 800-pound gorilla. Porsche didn't have to keep an entire troop of howling monkeys in line to squeeze the shorts.**\n\n**TL;DR: 80 10-pound monkeys can't squeeze as hard as one 800-pound gorilla.**\n\nDisclaimer 4 modz: Just saying that WSB is at a structural disadvantage when short squeezing, not that WSB should coordinate more.

It is very possible that GME volume today could exceed 100M shares matching the average daily volume of such trillion dollar capitalization giants such as AAPL.\n\nThe fact that GME\u2019s volume could approach the volume of AAPL \u2013 a company whose sales are more than 30 times larger is of course absurd. But GME is not an investment idea on any normal cash flow analysis basis. It is the preeminent \u201cmeme stock\u201d which moves strictly on the highly reactive buy and sell flows created on the Reddit r\/wallstreetbets bulletin board.\n\n#### Copycat trading could overwhelm current clearing processes\n\nThe GME phenomenon represents a completely new dynamic in the markets that combines social media dissemination, mobile access and commission free trading to create a giant, highly directed pool of capital that could verticalize any stock at any time for no other reason than flow.\u00a0\n\nWhile this is certainly fun and perhaps profitable for traders involved it creates massive externality problems that could have very negative effects elsewhere in the market. We\u2019ve already seen how such massive volatility swings forced RobinHood to suspend trading in the stock in order to meet margin calls from its clearing house. RobinHood has since shored up its balance sheet, but it is unclear if it will have enough capital to withstand a fresh wave of activity, especially if the GameStop gambit proves successful for the speculators involved and will then attract 5X or 10X new flows that could propagate through many thinly traded, financially dubious securities creating massive 200%-500% daily moves.\n\n#### Regulators Will Need to Step In\n\nWe have arrived at the moment where the market execution technology is completely overrunning the clearance and settlement protocols that haven\u2019t changed much in centuries. It is absolutely clear that if \u201cmeme trading\u201d is to continue markets will need to go to instant settlement of transactions \u2013 a task easier said than done. The clearing of trades is a multi-trillion business with thousands of actors and a million moving parts that cannot just instantly switch to a 99.99% uptime regime in order to accommodate swarms of speculative flow. Yesterday\u2019s FEDWIRE wire issues that deal with clearing banking transactions \u2013 a much larger and more important business \u2013 is testament to the fact that financial systems are vulnerable to a \u201cbrownout\u201d event \u2013 much like the one that occurred in the energy markets in Texas as abnormal demand completely overran supply.\n\nThe events in Texas were tragic and in many ways preventable but the laissez faire attitude of regulators exacerbated the problems a thousand fold. The very same dynamic may occur in the financial markets if regulators do not take control of the situation.\n\n#### Long term Bans may be the Only Policy Play\n\nAt this point it is unclear what regulators could do given the absence of quick legal, cultural and technological directives to instantly move to real-time settlement. The only choice of the regulators is to simply suspend trading in any security that moves more than 25% in a day absent any material financial information from the company. The suspensions would have to be far more draconian than the current\u00a0 versions that are in place. Regulators would in effect have to create system wide bans on any trading in the \u201cmeme stock\u201d security for days and perhaps weeks rather than minutes. The bans would have to be backed by strict civil penalties for any OTC trading of such securities so that the threat of punitive damages would cool off speculative flows.\u00a0\n\nIf a hobbyist Robin Hood trader who held $2000 of a suspended meme stock suddenly faced the prospect of a $50,000 fine for illegally trading it, the speculative fervor would cool.\n\n#### Anathema to Free Markets\n\nThis is of course a complete anathema to the notion of friction free securities markets where any participant is at liberty to do use his capital as he pleases. It is undoubtedly a drastic solution to the problem at hand, but for now it may be the only policy choice to make given the unintended consequences of letting this phenomena play itself out without any supervision.\n\nThe current financial system is simply unprepared and incapable of absorbing highly coordinated speculative flows that could overrun the underlying business of the global capital markets. The ultimate irony of the GameStop saga is that the very technology that has created unimaginable freedom to transact instantly at minimal cost may invite the most restrictive response imaginable in order to avoid a massive destabilization of the markets.\u00a0\n\n[www.60secondinvestor.com](https:\/\/www.60secondinvestor.com)",

You can\u2019t just look back to the good old times and assume they will get back there. GME currently hovers around -$5 EPS.\n\n***\n> So $210M of profit \u2013 for a company that did $6 BILLION in revenue in 2020 \u2013 isn\u2019t a huge lift.\n***\n**Response:** Except it is a huge lift.

Apples PE went from 19.73 in early 2020 to 33.92 currently. You compared GME to Best Buy and Best Buy has a PE ratio of 17.71.\n\n***\n>Assuming GameStop makes a strong move into the digital space and shores up their balance sheet, their pure fundamental fair value is conservatively (with no short squeeze) anywhere from a minimum of $65 (minimal profits and a market average PE ratio) to $400 (10% profit on 2020 revenue and digital retailer average PE ratio) per share.\n***\n**Response:** First, those are huge assumptions. GME only has to capture a lot of the digital market and also fix their losing money problem. I have no idea what magic you used to arrive at $65 or $400 per share. Their EPS is very red; their revenue is falling; and now they have to transition their entire business. I\u2019m not sure if you are delusional or criminal.",

Is a crash going to happen? **Yes.**\n\nIs it the end of civilization as we know it? **No.**\n\nAre you going to be ok? **Maybe.**\n\nWe're a genuine conglomerate of retards. Some of us are figurative retards, others of us are actual retards. No disrespect to the actually mentally handicapped.\n\nTake the latest GME craze for example.

Risk is inherent to life. ***And the chances of a massive financial disaster is never 0%.***\n\nSo quit freaking out about a financial collapse, because it's always a certainty.

They have entire departments and insiders that do nothing but research and investigate.

Hey, no shit. Criminals do that. If you're a crime boss, you know the other crime boss is probably fucking lying, so you hedge against his lies and use that shit against him. That's how it works.\n\nAnd that's how it works here, too. In the criminal world, people lie to you. In the stock market, big money manipulates shit. You can punch the sky, or you can accept that and play the game with those realities in mind.\n\nWhen I am in a trade, sure, I'm thinking about the fundamentals and future company performance. The news cycle. All the boring shit. But I'm *also* thinking about big money, retail traders, who is involved and how they are involved, and how all they will react to shifts in the stock price. You *have to,* because that's how the market ticks.\n\nYou only win by playing by the rules of the game, and the rules of this game are that the market is largely smoke and mirrors, and you'll never have even 1% of the knowledge or power that a typical hedge fund has. Don't fight it into bankruptcy like a fucking dongus. Play the game.\n\nAm I being negative? Nah, I'm being realistic. You want to fight to make the market more free and fair? Go on. Fight to make it better. It's a good thing to do, and I support it. And I'll help you. But in the meantime, accept what the market is *right now.* Don't throw you and your family's money away as a moral martyr, saying \"well i wouldn't have lost all my money if the market was different!\" It's not different. It is what it is.\n\nAnd if you legitimately can't disconnect yourself from that idealism, then it's probably just best not to trade. For your own sake.",

        "1088":"Why a long-term short squeeze isn't possible Thinking about all the craziness with GameStop stock over the past month made me think about how this is a great example of a real life game theory with the prisoner's dilemma.\n\nSo what is the prisoner\u2019s dilemma?\n\n\u201cThe prisoner's dilemma is a paradox in decision analysis in which two individuals acting in their own self-interests do not produce the optimal outcome. The typical prisoner's dilemma is set up in such a way that both parties choose to protect themselves at the expense of the other participant. As a result, both participants find themselves in a worse state than if they had cooperated with each other in the decision-making process. The prisoner's dilemma is one of the most well-known concepts in modern game theory.\u201d (Investopedia)\n\nApplying the prisoner\u2019s dilemma to what happened with GameStop is relatively simple. The best-case scenario (based on the stated goal) is for everyone to work together and \u201chold the line\u201d. This keeps the price of GameStop high and forces the hedge fund managers to lose money covering their shorts. On the other hand, the worst-case scenario is if no one buys or everyone sells their positions in a short period of time. This resorts in the shorts still being profitable for the hedge funds and ultimately the little guy has no impact on the market. Now what really happens, and what did, is that tons of people bought and held in the beginning, which is what shot the stock price to the moon. Now after about two weeks people started to bail, which represents the other two scenarios in the prisoner\u2019s dilemma. Where half of the party rats out the other half. With GameStop this is represented by some people starting to sell. The early sellers make most or all the profits leaving those who hold long term with a mostly worthless stock.",
        "1089":"The GME Fever, and How Your Money Can Be Better Utilized Nobody is going to call you an idiot for holding Gamestop from $5 throughout this insane run up, thinking it will go higher. Because it did and no doubt there was a great bit of excitement. \n\nBut if you look at what's going on this week as far as volume goes, it has gone down. It seems like the stock is going to move much more slowly with a lot less investors with interest. Lots of big players exited their positions already and probably aren't looking to buy back in anytime soon. \n\nThose who are holding see a short squeeze as on the horizon. They see dollar signs. But how realistic is that really? We keep getting information that the next report is around the corner and the shorts will be revealed as being in a bad position. \n\nIt hasn't happened. It may not happen. And many of you are slowly losing interest. \n\nThis subreddit is called WallStreetBets for a reason. We make bets. Very rarely does the great group hold shares for a long period of time. Those of you who have Gamestop options expiring soon probably are sweating. And you should be. \n\nThe point I have to make is, anyone still in Gamestop, why? You could be making so much more money elsewhere. Those who saw the signs and moved to weed stocks made a bundle. Now, granted most were in before the latest weed run up, but the momentum traders among you still made a good bit of coin. Obviously the weed craze won't last forever, but if you momentum trade like the majority of the group here, you'd be in and out with profit. \n\nThe long and short of it is, your money could be better spent elsewhere, even if elsewhere is on YOLOs for options that are far OTM. \n\nThe original theory on Gamestop may have been moving in the right direction, but where are we now? We're at a stock that's pretty low volume, trading pretty flat, or downward depending on your perspective, on the way to a sub billion dollar market cap. \n\nI think all of our money can be better spent somewhere else.

        "1091":"GME was a game. Weed is an artificially inflated bubble. There is a much better opportunity to make money and help society at the same time. I am an economist and a psychologist, I've been on reddit forever, and I've always been a market index etf\/hold type of investor (optimal balance of risk\/reward) so I had no use for subreddits like r\/wallstreetbets in the past.\n\nWith all the noise bubbling up about GME, I was curious to see what's up.   My take on what's going on:\n\nGME:  Let's get real.  It's a doomed brick and mortar game company.  Boosting it was fun, but it's ultimately artificial and we all know we're unlikely to hand more and more of our personal dollars over to Gamestop in the coming years even if they come up with some kind of competent online strategy (it's laughable we're still waiting on that this late in the game).  Sorry if you're holding the bag, but there's no point.  The company doesn't have legs.\n\nWeed: This is a legitimate industry with very predictable, steady long term growth as more markets come online with easing laws and regs.   It's not going to grow much more in existing markets.  Weed is just weed.   You can only consume so much, and it's easy to get sick of it.   It has some limited medical uses, but it's not about to surprise us.   IOW, the long term growth potential is all priced in.   Boosting it was fun, but ultimately pointless, WSB has generated another bubble.  Don't get caught holding the bag here either.\n\nPsychedelics:   Ok this is a real opportunity.   The research on psychedelics is astounding.  It's effective in novel ways, providing profound relief from otherwise intractable conditions like major depressive disorder, and used in conjuction with therapy, is effective for helping people cope with PTSD, anxiety, and potentially many other emotional issues.   Unlike other medicines used to treat these conditions, it appears possible to deliver psychelic therapies with very minimal side effects.   As a psychologist, I am incredibly hopeful about the potential benefits it can bring with proper research and social acceptance.  As an economist, I see a world changing development that doesn't just boost the economy, but the well being of people as a whole.  Investing in pyschedics will actually help usher them into the mainstream, opening up more research opportunities and pushing back on the long-standing conservative stranglehold preventing us from discovering more about the potential for these drugs.  \n\nIn other words, it's good for a short term investment, it's great for long term investment, and it's a much more prosocial investment than say, tryiing to \"stick it to the big guys.\"  I recommend the ETF PSYK, and the company MMEDF Mind Medicine (MindMed) Inc.   Both are great entry points.\n\nThat's my two cents!",

Then, the munchies kick in full force and you got to a Wendy's parking lot and jack off to a video of your wife flipping you off while riding a dong as least eight times longer than your 5 dollar inch long. There is a fucking bubble and you should get in. And it's a good long-term investment, so you should get in (none of this is financial advice, this is just me talking to myself in Reddit after taking anti-depressants from holding Gamestop).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Reason 1:** Everyone's a bull. The pigs and bears are dead because there's more money than what financial institutions know what to do with.\n\nRemember SPY puts? Remember printer goes brrrrrr? Remember how monetary policy produced some of the greatest loss porn we've ever seen. Gay bears is kill and the government has proven that they will probably prop up the financial system even if bubonic plague 2.0 happens. That money is still floating around with the Fed's finger on the trigger prepared to smack the equity markets back up. That money was invested into stocks like TSLA (which is the most beautiful and terrifying bubble I've seen in my life). That money will also make weed stocks as high as a kite. Discounted cash flows, betas, stock\/bond conflicts, and all that other stuff is irrelevant. Monetary policy is fundamental and will always save those who have money.\n\nThis is the new reality we live with. Like it or buy some guns, ammunition, and a lifetime worth of soylent and beyond meat and start your own 1 person country in the backass of nowhere.\n\nThere will be a bubble and it will pop. Do not be concerned about the pop until it appears imminent. And even if it does, I would still consider holding it for a delicious long play.\n\n**Reason 2:** APHA's balance sheet is robust. Doesn't show any signs of collapsing financially. Longevity in a new industry is golden.\n\n[https:\/\/www.marketwatch.com\/investing\/stock\/apha\/financials](https:\/\/www.marketwatch.com\/investing\/stock\/apha\/financials)\n\nInstead of getting high on their own supply when their stock soared as high as a kite, the comedown was harsh. But instead of getting rekt, they have been expanding rapidly regardless. Their sales have increased 142.34% in 2017, 80.62% in 2018, **542.28%** in 2019, and 128.73% in 2020. And considering that everyone's spending their stimulus money smoking weed and buying Gamestop, I do not see this trend stopping at any point. I've been to my local weed shop in CA and it's fucking packed every time I go in both pick ups and lines. I have to wait at least 45 minutes to get in.\n\nEven though the net income is concerning (it usually is for companies that grow rapidly due to the costs of expanding like a chad), the firm has a really large pillow to fall on. To be clear, for a company to be totally dead in the water, its equity (the difference between its assets and liabilities) goes to zero. APHA has 2.5 billion in assets and .7125 mil in liabilities. This is perhaps one of the reasons it gobbled up Tilray-- APHA recognizes it can increase its market share in an inevitable market place. This means that the company can continue its rapid expansion without worrying about defaulting. For reference, Amazon could afford to lose hundreds of millions of dollars from 2012-2015 because it has the assets to afford rapid expansion. We are looking at a potential hundred billion dollar company here as the marijuana industry consolidates into a few major players. APHA is likely to be one of those, as it has the durability and fundamentals to survive years of consecutive negative net income. APHA's largest expenses are \"unusual expenses,\" implying that they are really swinging for the fences with many one-time expansive purchases. \n\n**Reason 3:** Because of BLM and a decade of rising sentiment against the war on drugs, enforcing weed possession and sales laws are politically dangerous.\n\nYup. Nixon's law and order paradigm is falling out of the sky. Busting into people's apartments for a gram of weed and sentencing the occupants to 9 years in prison is not too popular. Even if marijuana legalization doesn't happen this or next or whatever, the tide has overwhelming turned against a \"tough on crime\" attitude toward non-violent drug use. This means that across the United States (and likely the world over the next decade or so), **weed will be effectively legal** over time even if it's not truly legal.\n\nPosition: 40 shares of APHA high as a motherfucking kite.",

Big applause to the retards who won that and drove the price of GME past $100.\n\nHere is an example:  Melvin Capital closed their shorts on 1\/26 when GME was at $148. If they were shorting since at least the start of January when it was at $17, then they lost $17 sold - $148 bought = $131 for each shorted stock they had. They bought at 148\/17 = 8.7X how much they sold the stock for.\n\nUltimately, they motivated short holders to cover their position at a fat loss. However, shares short as a percentage of float still remained dummy high the same week. Why? Because new shorts came at higher price points of GME stock ($300+) than before. For those hedge fund institutions to be incentivized to cover their newer short position, GME would need to keep skyrocketing, at least into the $500 range to put pressure on their shorts at $300, and that isn't even 2x how much they sold the stock for. Remember, about 9X is when Melcin Capital finally threw in the towel.  If it does go that high and institutions do sell though, then they could  further carry it into who knows, maybe 1k+ where the moon awaits. Ok so if you're holding, goal is to get the stock to $500+ so that a short squeeze can happen. Remember, getting it to $500 won't happen because of a short squeeze.\n\nThis means that initial jump into a solid $500 stock price would need to be made mostly by retail investors, of which, have already invested into GME. Literally the WHOLE WORLD is on this boat including Europe and even China. Listen, if the hype was real enough to get global attention, that's the peak man! You're not gonna find more retail investors to jump onto the GME ship to carry it to $500+, there just isn't any more people. So, I don't think retail investors have the remaining capital to keep boosting GME stock price because its peaked its hype.\n\nStill thinking GME has dummy high short interest and you don't care about what i've just said? Think again, more than half the shorts were covered Friday\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/1vjhmhbcixe61.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ebdee3c6797eb0d2941d98f2991c29ce009e983\n\nWhat does this mean? If capital is all tied up and gme isn't moving up, people will sell. If they sell, you already know what that means... its over.\n\nSo to save my tendies and maybe yours, I'll be the first to say I sold my GME stock and moved it all into LGND. Wtf is LGND? Fuck if i know. But I do know (as far as my research goes) they're now THE MOST HEAVILY SHORTED COMPANY.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/g1bke9kgixe61.png?width=576&format=png&auto=webp&s=59909847a2ed8cba0924a8ff22b40d7d9ee23fb3\n\nThis was the whole reason why GME was a gem to begin with and it happened, that bitch mooned because we like the stock. But without the short position to help keep it bolstered, it doesn't have support like LGND does. The short position on LGND is at a super high 65% and most of those are from a month ago or before when the stock price was half. THIS MEANS THE SHORTS ARE PRIMED TO BE COVERED ALREADY! HOP THE FUCK IN BOYS. Positions = buy the damn stock.\n\nTLDR; GME is dying. I like LGND stock better\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: \ud83d\ude80LGND\ud83d\ude80\n\nTo the many of you still thinking GME shorts are high AF and over 100%, thats because the information you're getting IS NOT UP TO DATE. The stock exchanges releases short interest data once every two weeks for the public to see. I paid to see data daily. GME short interest has declined sharply because shorts were covered.

You philosophy guys may have heard of Occam\u2019s Razor: The simplest explanation is usually correct. \n\nGameStop had one of the craziest rallies of all time, $2.57 last summer to $500. The popular opinion is \u201chedge funds manipulating the price down\u201d right? Well GameStop is down 65% from the peak last week, and a lot of you will baghold to the ground. Here\u2019s the simplest explanation: Initial short squeeze blew up several funds (RIP Melvin), guys who got in early used the hype as an exit opportunity, new shorts entered near the peak, and the 5 million new kids here listened to Dave Portnoy and bought the top bc diamond handz. \n\nIt\u2019s not manipulation when a stock that ran up 2000% in a week pulls back, it\u2019s mean reversion. The manipulation was what we did pushing it all the way to $500 and wrecking shop on the way. \n\n\u201cBut the VW chart from 09!\u201d This isn\u2019t VW. Porsche cornered VW shares by itself and refused to sell. They controlled that squeeze single handedly. There have been 100M shares trading daily, you really think everyone here is actually holding? If they were the price never would have dropped back below $400. Smart money took profits and everyone else is holding out of hope. Hopium is a dangerous drug.\n\nHow did you think this would end? Obviously profit taking would come eventually, and it looks like it hit at $500. Posting a screenshot of your 5 shares and a \ud83d\udc8e\u270b\ud83c\udffc meme won\u2019t hold the price up forever. The real winners got in early and took profits as the media caught on.\n\nThis is the stock market. You come here to make money. You buy low and sell high. If you refused to sell bc you believed the hype, that\u2019s on you and you alone. You can sell at anytime, so don\u2019t blame others for your losses.\n\nRIP the guy who YOLO\u2019d at $300 today, may as well have set that money on fire.

And if they actually were getting fucked, they would have covered a while ago.\n\nMy theory is that when GME went to its lows, the shorts essentially saw this as a gift from the gods. They were expecting GME to go to 0 in the next 5 years, not in 1. So they most likely saw that there was immense upside and instead of simply covering, they leveraged themselves to the tits with calls just like u\/deepfuckingvalue, essentially creating a hedge for their short position. They knew GME would have a rebound in this covid economy and they basically shilled it on retail to make fat stacks. Once their calls print, they will own millions of shares which they can use to cover. After seeing Cohen's plan for the company they might even short it the fuck down again.\n\nTLDR shorts aren't getting fucked, they're reaping in tendies from both directions",
        "1105":"Why your GME losses have nothing to do with Robinhood Before you downvote me to hell, no I don't use Robinhood because they don't support cost basis tax optimizations and other features like IRA accounts. I'm just tired of the daily posts crying about wsb tendies being stolen by Robinhood.\n\n**You really want to know who stole your tendies?** Look at every single gain post on the front page. How the fuck do you think those users realized their gains? By SELLING their thousands of shares and call options and driving the price down. This is the nature of a short squeeze - it's just a pyramid scheme and the truth is that the all of the people buying in at the top are getting fucked. \n\n\nNow I know you retards can't do your own research so here's a FAQ to answer all your conspiracy theory questions:\n\n\n\n**Why did Robinhood only restrict buy orders?**\n\nFirstly, this is false. Robinhood paused *opening positions*. So if you were short GME (or short put options), you could close your position by buying back GME or buying back your put option. So why is closing positions OK but opening positions is not? Because closing a position is a reduction in risk (since you have realized your gain\/loss) while opening positions is an increase in risk - something that the clearinghouse factors in when it calculates the broker's collateral requirement.\n\nSecondly, if Robinhood had restricted closing positions as well, I'm 100% sure you retards would be complaining about not being able to sell on GME's second highest peak day.\n\n**If I bought GME shares using cash, why did Robinhood have trouble posting collateral to the DTCC?**\n\nFirst off, it's illegal for brokers to use cash from customers to post collateral. Secondly, the DTCC unilaterally raised the collateral requirement for both shares and options above its normal requirement (the exact percentage is confidential but will be revealed in the congressional hearing). And finally, trading volume *more than doubled* in a single day from January 26th - January 27th (most of this increase is due to trading on Robinhood). So Robinhood not having enough cash to cover a more than 3X increase in collateral is perfectly reasonable. If you have a 3k mortgage payment every month and one month your bank says you now owe 9k, how many of you would be able to pay up? Robinhood's decision was basically between restricting a stock that less than 10% of users on Robinhood own or shutting down for the rest of the week, if not longer, because it longer has its primary clearing house to settle any trades.\n\n**Robinhood earns money from Citadel and Citadel bailed out Melvin Capital and even my smooth brain can connect the dots**\n\nYou're legitimately retarded if you actually think Citadel called up Robinhood to perpetuate market manipulation. Ah yes, Citadel pays quants 400k+ a year to come up with alpha generating strategies but the only way they can make money is to call up a broker and commit market manipulation in the most easily traceable way ever??? \n\nI actually don't understand the logic here. Your theory is that Citadel needed Robinhood to bail them out of their short positions. And yet the day after Robinhood lifted restrictions, short interest *increased* back to pre-restriction levels. **Why the fuck would hedge funds commit market manipulation to get out of their short positions, only to double down on more short positions the day after??**\n\n**Robinhood restricting opening long positions caused GME to tank I'm fucking poor now fuck Robinhood etc.**\n\nIf you graph Robinhood's restrictions against the price of GME, you actually get an inverse correlation (r^2 = -0.73). That is, when Robinhood first introduced restrictions, GME had its second best trading day. Then every day following, as Robinhood reduced restrictions, GME price fell lower and lower. What does this mean? Robinhood adding restrictions is not the reason why GME is tanking.  \n\nSo why is it tanking? Short squeezes are basically a pyramid scheme. The people at the top are the people that got in early. Then as the hype builds, more people join the bottom of the pyramid. That influx of new retards is the ONLY thing that is supporting the upwards price movement because the company has zero fundamentals. Finally there comes a point when enough people at the top cash out their massive positions and at the same time new people aren't joining the hype quickly enough (realistically, who the fuck is buying 420 shares when the price is $300+). And everything comes crumbling down. \n\nSorry to shatter your rosy perception of wsb, but you have to realize that every post telling you to \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c when the stock was 300+ was a massive fucking bait. Cramer pointed this out and advised everyone to cash out while we were ahead but you guys roasted him to fuck for it. It's only sad that you guys now choose to pin this on Robinhood, the company that made the entire squeeze and this very sub possible in the first place.\n\n**tldr** you guys are fucking retards that bought into a pyramid scheme and now blame Robinhood for being unable to keep up with your chain inting.",

Maybe Melvin \"closed\" the short position, but in all likely hood it was taken on by citadel.

Right now they are buying up all of the GME fixed income notes. Once Citadel has cornered that side of the market, they will politely encourage GME to issues shares at these record high prices to pay down the debt. The higher the stock goes now - the more citadel will make once the float normalizes via their short.

And they keep on lowering it till they find buyers.

        "1111":"Is GME a zombie squeeze? Everybody is optimistic about GME and I am and have been since I got in at $15. I got out at $60 but my risk tolerance isn\u2019t super high so I\u2019m fine with it and enjoying watching all of the gains from the sidelines.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to rain on the parade but I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about VW, AMC, and GME and their short squeezes. Until this week, and specifically today, I\u2019ve basically been of the mind set that GME is a real squeeze and the others (AMC, etc.) are not. But today I\u2019ve changed my opinion. Please hear me out because I think there is a lot of logic to this.\n\nTHE SQUEEZE SQUOZE, NOW IT\u2019S SIMPLE SUPPLY DEMAND\nRyan Cohen and GME ruling out bankruptcy are what caused the squeeze. Plain and simple. They created a better outlook and higher genuine value for the company. This gave us a little squeeze forcing shorts to move from their ~140% to ~120% short interest today.\n\nNow that that squeeze occurred and they had to deal with raised price targets, we are simply dealing with very low supply. Shorters are not buying to cover really and lots of retards are buying creating upward movement a momentum. Not much supply. So right now there is no squeeze going on and we are all very dependent on stock lenders margin calling the shorts.\n\n\nTHIS ISN\u2019T VW\nJust wanted to add a short section here since this event does seem to be the inspiration we all draw from. In this case the shorts did get fucked and got margin called. The lenders did this because there was genuine concern that they would not get there stock back since there is 13x more shorted than there was available. If you buy that 1% and give it back to a lender you have 12% more to go, then you have to buy that 1% from that lender you just got it from, but what if they won\u2019t sell? There was genuine concern from lenders they would never get their shares back. Total loss.\n\n\nTHESE SHORTS WONT BE MARGIN CALLED ANY TIME SOON\nAs it currently stands the shorts are paying 30% APR on tens of billions of dollars to the lenders with VERY LITTLE risk in the long term that they will not be able to get the shares back as EVERYBODY (even is, mind you) expects the shares to go back down a lot after this is said and done.\n\nSo from a lender\u2019s perspective, would you rather call your shares back and end the party with huge yearly returns? Or would you rather drag this on for as long as possible and collect fees from shorts? The shorts will happily do it because they don\u2019t want to lose their shirt, they would rather pay the premium. And even if they did call their shares back, the market would explode and crash before they even had them settled.\n\nReally in the end, we are giving Melvin and the other shorts more time to adjust their position to a more favorable one before it comes back down. So in the end, unlike your believe that bears are fuk, it is retail investors that may be fuk.\n\n\nCAN GME SQUEEZE HARDER?\nI would say probably not soon. It could go higher if people keep buying and holding, but again, in the end retail might end up paying.\n\nThe one opportunity I do see would be a share vote or something else that could cause shares to be recalled. But that is unlikely and might not even happen at the yearly investor meeting.\n\n\nHOW TO MAKE MONEY ON THIS\nHonestly without lucky timing retail investors may be fucked here. Premiums on puts make it practically impossible to profit.\n\nWHAT ABOUT THE OTHER SQUEEZES?\nSimilarly to the current state of GME, we are driving price up and giving shorts better entry and lenders fat APR.\n\nTL;DR: this may be the best trick Wall-street ever played on us. Play acting that they are losing money and Robinhood is their martyr.\n\nEdit: Thanks for commenting everybody. After this interaction I think the squeeze could work out, but it would take insane diamond hands and\/or some strong buy pressure. Time and high borrow rates need to ware them down to be sure that this squeeze happens.",
        "1112":"[GME] Why I feel less optimistic after Friday Please don't lynch me. No, I wasn't paid by Melvin to deter your cause. I'm mostly looking for people to tell me why I'm wrong because all the posts I see are full of shit and are so overly emotional that they seem to lack any kind of logic. Everyone was saying there will be a short ladder attack before close, there wasn't. Everyone was saying there will be a gamma squeeze if we close over 320 and there wasn't. Friday was the first time when I didn't feel I understand what is actually happening - does anybody? Something feels off and we might even have been lead into a trap by Melvin or other hedge funds for them to recoup their losses, So please hear me out first.\n\n(1) Public attention hit its maximum on Friday after being already extremely high on Thursday. It will likely subside rapidly next week especially if we have big dips.\n\n(2) Most calls in the money were probably bought by people who actually don't have the funds to cover them. AH, suddenly 4 million shares were traded (after 40 million) for the whole day, the price dropped rapidly. IMHO what happened is that RH automatically liquidated 40k calls ITM because the holders didn't have enough funds to exercise them (i.e. for a $115 call you need 11500 in your account). This freed up the need to hedge those shares and they were immediately sold.\n\n(3) Calls are now available up to 800 and they're actually not as expensive as you might think, so it's actually possible to hedge shorts quite effectively at this point. If the price doesn't hit $1000 soon, it will be very hard to squeeze. And we need to get there with buying shares only against people who can probably load up on shorts still and without the buying pressure of a squeeze and with considering (1).\n\n(4) Short interest might still be 120%, but these are now people that shorted between 400 and 500 and are already hedged with let's say 600 calls.\n\n(5) A squeeze to infinity would take down brokers and probably the entire market. Do you really believe this is going to happen? Don't be ridiculous. They can change the rules as they please and they did it before.\n\n(6) There are two many players involved now. Before it was an easy story. One hedge fund fucked up their risk management and redditors fuck with them. Now you have people who just FOMOed in and actually have no clue about the underlying squeeze and gamma squeeze theory (because IMHO it actually doesn't work anymore). You have other hedge funds for which I don't know if they're actually going for the squeeze or just trying to get as much money from retailers piling in. What if they loaded up on short all the time around 330, then let the price fall to 250 and buy back in just to give the illusion that retailers still control the situation? To me the price movements look extremely professional, this IMHO is not retail driven anymore. Even if they go for the squeeze. What tells you that they will not be the only one capitalizing on it leaving retailers holding the bag? They know the game 100 times better than any of you and _will_ screw you over.\n\n(7) We actually don't know who is short where and how it's hedged. Simple as that. Before it was Melvin shorted probably around 50 and in deep shit, now who the hell knows. We don't know if they actually covered. There's also dark pools btw. Just because volume was low is not a guarantee this didn't happen.\n\nI thought about this long and hard. Here are IMHO the possible outcomes.\n\n(A) People lose interest next week. The price will fall, people will panic sell. And a lot of you people will lose a lot of money you can't afford to lose. I feel extremely sorry about that because I really liked the movement.\n\n(B) The government will intervene and offer $10k to every GME holder per share to resolve the situation. The money has to be paid by Melvin, regulations will change etc. I think this is highly unlikely as it feels unfair to the people not joining.\n\n(C) The squeeze will go to infinity, each of you will be a billionaire and wallstreet will completely collapse together with the global stock market, because everyone in power who could have easily prevented it by just changing the rules will think it's time for a revolution and it would be unfair towards retailers to intervene. If you believe that, you are seriously retarded, and not in a good way.\n\n(D) The price will keep going up a little bit, but it's not a squeeze. It's orchestrated by hedge funds to make their money back from all the people piling in believing they are still fighting although the battle is already lost. Once they realize, people lose interest the price goes to zero and people will lose everything.\n\n(E) We will have more pressure and there's actually some squeezing going on. It could go to maybe 5000 before the government steps in, halts trading and most likely forces gamestop to dilute shares. Force because Gamestop really enjoys the attention and would draw a lot of hate doing this. But actually getting a lot of free money would probably be more attractive still, so they might do it even without being forced once they can negotiate a good deal with Melvin or whoever is interested to buy the shares at a reasonable price.\n\nDon't get me wrong. I believe in the movement and I'm immensely proud of everyone showing immense solidarity fighting the right fight, just don't be only led by your emotions, also stop to think and add some logic.\n\nI'm still long 100 shares, because I might be wrong, but I just feel after Friday the risk is significantly higher. Please safe, only invest what you're happy to lose (because this is the most likely outcome) and don't forget to try and understand what's actually happening.\n\nEdit: After thinking even longer and harder I now realize that the total amount of shares is super low and that's right there a good *logical* argument why after all this might work. None of you idiots pointed this out to me though. Good luck everyone. I'll hold my remaining shares, now that I have more than just an emotional reason.

        "1113":"\u2265100% SI is NOT conclusive proof of naked shorting Here's why.\n\nI'm fucking broke because I bought GME at $350 and \ud83e\uddfb\ud83d\udc50 on Tuesday. This means that when I run out of instant lemonade to snort and need more, I go get a grand from a payday lender. There is now $1,000 of debt (owned by the payday lender) and $1,000 of cash (owned by me). \n\nThe day after I take out my loan, my cousin Dan comes whining to me because his deathtrap beater broke down. (He shorted GME at $5 during the summer, so he's even more broke than I am.) Since I'm a sap, I loan him enough to get it fixed, say $500. Remember, I'm broke too, so that $500 comes out of the $1,000 I got from the payday lender.\n\nHere's the important part: There is still only $1,000 of cash ($500 owned by Dan, $500 by me), but the amount of debt has gone up to **$1,500** ($500 owned by me, and the original $1,000 owned by the payday lender). **This is not illegal**, or even against the rules (to a greater extent than that the payday lender will be squeezing my balls, so I have a strong incentive to get up Dan's ass about his share\u2014but at the end of the day that's a problem for the three of us and the local law enforcement couldn't give a shit).\n\n*Shares that are sold short are just shares to the people who buy them, so they can usually be borrowed and sold short again*. This makes it possible for a stock to have, in theory, infinity% SI without a single naked short existing. \n\nDo naked shorts of GME probably exist anyway? If the fail-to-deliver statistics that have been posted here are remotely accurate, I would lean strongly towards yes. Is it still retarded to short a stock \u2265100% of float (and will that probably produce a short squeeze)? Also yes. Does shorting still dilute the market and expose the shorter to significant risk even if it's not naked? Yes. But none of those mean you should go around stating GME's SI (real, theoretical, or historical) as any kind of proof that it's been shorted naked. Get better evidence and know what you're talking about.",

        "1116":"Why I liquidated all my GME holdings at an 80% loss to go all in on AMC? I will start this DD by saying to those still holding GME, your awesome and I cheer your successes with it and support you in your losses. I know that many of you bought the stock b\/c you truly like the company and I honestly believe Ryan Cohen and his new pals will turn the ship around for GameStop, although believe that will take some time.\n\nI will try to keep this brief for all the apes \/ autists here but even YOLO plays should have some level of reason to them (maybe?).\n\nTLDR version -\n\n1. GME is better positioned for a SS 2.0 but AMC will likely benefit\n2. AMC is better fundamentally positioned as the economy re-opens and consumers migrate from video games to getting out and socializing at the movies\n3. AMC pre-pandemic was around $6 - $7 supporting the current buy point (although it may go lower as GME drags lower)\n4. AMC took advantage of it's rising stock price to eliminate some of its debt\n5. Whales believe in it's potential too - Dave Portney bought $700k worth of AMC yesterday\n\nAs of 2\/4, S3 shows 15.71% shares float short interest against AMC (44.68M out of 284.47M) vs 50.68% of GME (25.86M out of 51.03M float). This isn't public, I had to pay for this.\n\nShort interest is one thing, but lets compare that to daily volume.\n\nThe 20 Average Volume is 72.7 M for GME and 289M for AMC. AMC goes through 101.6% of it's float shares a day and GME goes through 142% of it's float across the 20 day average. This makes the short ratio (or days to cover) at 0.356 for GME and 0.155 for AMC which means that if a SS 2.0 were to happen it will more than likely happen for GME as the short positions on AMC could quickly be covered without causing much craziness. However, AMC's swings is heavily correlated to GME - see below.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Price Swing Between AMC vs GME across Short Squeeze](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/7gdp49o8djf61.png?width=2310&format=png&auto=webp&s=339dab698f0722a62b99e00b334cdd1e3dad88fd)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile correlation is not causation, it's likely that during a GME SS 2.0, this will greatly impact AMC. Furthermore, the AMC has not crashed as much as GME either having now overtaken it today in the upward direction. As GME continues to slide down amidst restrictions and scrutiny, all of the people that had 10x profit of their investment will began to recognize more and more how heavy \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c can be causing more sell-off reducing the impact of a SS 2.0 (e.g. if it falls to $30, I don't think SS 2.0 could take it above $90).\n\nI previously wrote a DD about how GME could be fundamentally worth $300, I think that will take quite a bit of time in re-inventing the company whereas AMC will benefit much more quickly than GameStop in the short-term. As the economy re-opens, people will be running away from video games to getting out and going to watch movies. The pre-pandemic price of AMC 2\/14\/20 was $7.10 which means that at the very least if it goes down by a lot more, it is likely to return to this level as the economy re-opens. In other words, AMC is on discount right now while GME will continue to be on discount for a while and continually increasing it's discount percentage (so you could make profits on AMC and then get GME for an even greater discount than currently).\n\nLong-term, I think AMC will continue to struggle as distribution companies look to release films through streaming platforms but for now as economic restrictions continue to lift and more people feel safer about getting out and about, AMC is primed for vast short-term success. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nFundamentally, this is safer than holding out for a GME SS 2.0 and still benefits from a GME SS 2.0 as well.\n\nAs of Q3 2020, AMC has a debt-to-asset ratio of 121.47% vs GME debt-to-asset ratio of 87.3%. However, AMC didn't start opening up theaters until Aug 20, 2021 which is 50 days closed out of 91 days of the quarter (e.g. they were open for less than half of the quarter) while continuing to pay for benefits to all of its employees. This bleeds through cash like a bullet wound to the aorta. As opposed to GameStop, they were able to open many of it's stores earlier in Q2 with eCommerce growth and continued Q3 debt-to-asset increase. That said, for Q4, many of AMC's theaters were open being able to start earning revenue and not just bleeding money.\n\nQ4's EPS estimate for AMC is -$3.68 EPS vs Q3 -$5.70. I actually believe it won't be as low and could be as high as -$3 EPS. The last year AMC was profitable was 2017 as people spend more time streaming movies than going to the movies, but the forecasted trend is still positive for AMC.\n\nThe major weight on a company's ability to overcome obstacles, such as a global pandemic, is having to take on debt. Debt can open lots of opportunities, but if it's a means to survive rather than grow, it really creates a burden. This is where AMC made a great move in my opinion over GME with converting it's debt to shares eliminating $600M worth of debt. While it has diluted the shares (and would have diluted GME shares too) reducing SS potential, it enhances the ability of the company to grow reducing that burden of debt.\n\nFinally, Dave Portney who said he was exiting all the meme stocks has went back into AMC by $700k - [https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/dave-portnoy-stakes-700k-amc-061244626.html](https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/dave-portnoy-stakes-700k-amc-061244626.html).\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80My price target for AMC is $30 within the year \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80. It's been there before and with bent-up demand, it has a lot more to gain than hoping for a GME SS 2.0.\n\nAMC is expected to report earnings on 2\/25\/21.\n\n**Note:** This will be my last DD post on this sub.

I wrote a post on r\/wsb noting I didn't think the stock was a long and it was removed! Now there's some Stalinesque behavior! In Soviet bubble, all stock must go up! Jokes aside, this $3 billion market cap \\[edit: now 6B\\] had $300m in cash flow at peak. I don't care that the stock has gone from 4 to 40--I'm interested in where it goes from here. A turnaround (can you call it that? a return to normal...) could bring cash flows to their old peak, but I suspect the continuing demise of retail and other headwinds probably make peak achievable cash flow closer to $200m. So, you're paying 15x for a turnaround\/return that hasn't happened yet. That's not outrageously expensive, but it's not for me. Plenty of cheaper stocks out there.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0One more thing--trying to game short-selling--a bit of a metamarket approach--rarely works in my experience. I've seen all kinds of \"squeezes\" like \\[CENSORED TICKER\\], Volkswagen\/Porsche, etc. While there are functional market mechanics that are worth knowing and watching, trying to 'battle' in the marketplace doesn't make sense. Look at HLF, etc. At the end of the day, the value of the company will be what matters, which is generally a function of the cash flow of the company. There are other dynamics, of course, that's what makes a good trader a good trader. I'd rather ignore that stuff and be a decent investor, since I think there is limited causal reasoning in the former. Intuition rules the trader, and we're in a very non-intuitive environment.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, I think GME is more of a long at $20 and more of a short at $60-80. No need to get upset about one's opinion. I have been around Internet message boards on stocks since they began, and geez, people get emotional, way more than r\/wsb. I have really ticked people off my entire life on stock message boards (and come to think of it... everywhere else) pointing out the obvious. See some old posts of mine on \\[CENSORED TICKER\\], CYTX, ONTY, NFLD and many more. All of those stocks disappeared with failure. GME is a real company with valueable assets.
