{"text":{"0":"DFV's Roaring Kitty Spreadsheet Recreated with Free Data! I've been working on a project to recreate DFV's Roaring Kitty (RK) spreadsheets that he used to track movements and metrics on thousands of stocks, but with free data because I didn't make $30M on GME. It's now useful enough that you can download it for yourself.\n\nThis latest version tracks top movers, insider buying, industry breakdowns, and calculates multiple value metrics.

Is stock similarity search even possible? Should I build a demo and YOLO my entire 401k? lol I am an engineer that works in the tech industry (mainly focused on open source projects)\n\nI am building a vector database called [Milvus](https:\/\/github.com\/milvus-io\/milvus).\n\nSome background information:\n\nVector databases are databases that specialize in storing vectors. Deep learning models can basically convert any kind of data (image, audio, 3d models, etc.) into vectors, so in a way, a vector database can store any kind of data. With a vector database, you can search similar vectors. So, with deep learning and vector databases, it is possible to perform a similarity search for any kind of data...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy idea is to input a snippet of a stock, see if it matches a snippet of a stock from the past:\n\n1. We use some deep learning algorithms to extract features (vectors) from stock retrospective data (snippet).\n2. Store the features in a vector database.\n3. Search similar stock snippets that are stored in the database using new stock snippets.\n4. Wait until one stock snippet looks similar to GME during pre short squeeze...\n\nThe features for a stock can be a stock's price history, technical indicators, news, Reddit mentions, etc.\n\nCan we find the next GME using this? If there is a stock that has a very similar trend to GME in terms of technical indicators, retail investors' emotions, etc.\n\nTheoretically, if the retrospective data of stocks have a correlation with their future price movement, this is definately possible.\n\nJust a thought. But maybe I am on to something...\n\nRoast me plz :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;","2":"DWAC-Warrant \/ long-dated call arbitrage? Long time lurker (full disclosure, mostly for selling options once IV explodes after some genius identifies the \"next GME\"), with an arbitrage opportunity.\n\nThe arbitrage is go long DWAC warrants and sell long-dated calls, lever it up, and pocket the spread until prices converge. Curious if anyone can poke holes in the trade here:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Buy 1 DWAC warrant. It's exercisable at $11.5 15 days after merger transaction is completed or once year after registration, which would be October 2022. Right now selling for \\~$37\n* Sell 1 Dec\\`22 call with $10 strike for \\~$65.\n* You've pocketed 65-37 = $28 per unit of the above.\n* Once the warrant are exercisable, the two securities above are almost the exact same thing ($11.5 exercise price vs. $10 excercise price call options). At this point, the price converge, close the trade, and you keep the above $28 per unit.\n* You can lever this up high because (interactive brokers at least) views this as a well-hedged trade, and there is little margin impact.\n\nWhat am I getting wrong? How can this blow up?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**I can't reply in comments, some replies here:**\n\n[Initial entry](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/ZXHTYfG)\n\n\\-----\n\nThank you AuditControl\\_Inbox, you're right, assignment is the risk. Basically risk is assignment and can't exit resulting short and re-establish some other long-dated calls fast enough before the $27 spread (less whatever warrants rise during the moon) gets eaten up by owning the short.\n\nWhich to be honest, is a risk I like for the payoff.\n\n\\-----\n\nwhoever says it's a covered call, no, that's dumb. it's a bet that a european-ish option with basically the same strike price will become an american option post-transaction or October'22, and that the prices will converge when that happens allowing you to pocket the current price spread. I would never excerise anything to do with this garbage stock.\n\n\\----\n\nYes, this is basically the same as shorting common and long warrants, but without borrow fees or callback risk. But as auditcontrol pointed out, there is assignment risk.\n\n&#x200B;","3":"$CHWY DD This DD is short, because the logic is straightforward and intuitive.

Please see below for my thoughts:\n\n1.  Inflation has proven to be more than transitory. Yes, I do believe that there are some parts of inflation that will likely be transitory and due to supply and demand equilibrium imbalances (supply constraints). We have seen this occur in certain commodities such as lumber, which reversed heavily from recent highs, and I also believe new automobiles is another category that will likely wane to some degree, as computer chip shortages are slowly rectified. This theoretically should bring the cost of used automobiles down over time as well. Despite all of this, the most concerning area of inflation is centered in residential real estate, specifically average rents, and owner\u2019s equivalent rents (OER). This area has been skyrocketing, being fueled by a low interest rate environment, a tight housing market with limited supply and lack of ramp up in building, and commodity input price increases. Given how large of an impact rental pricing and OER pricing has on overall consumer health, I expect this to be a major factor in macro-economic health. Furthermore, rental real estate is typically a fixed contract term length, which often extends to 12 months or more, therefore this inflation will prove to be \u201csticky\u201d.\n\n2.  The Federal Reserve (Fed) has indicated its plans to begin tapering their bond purchases. In simple terms, this is equivalent to injecting less money into bank reserves at the Fed. This in itself is likely not very meaningful, as there is so much excess liquidity in bank reserves that cannot enter into the real economy, as lenders do not have the risk appetite to lend as aggressively as they did pre-pandemic. A large part of this is the overall indebtedness of the average borrower, given the high accumulation of debt to cover cash flow shortfalls over the last 12 months. The real concern around Fed bond purchase tapering is simple. It indicates to the market that the Fed sees inflation as potentially more than transitory and that interest rate hikes are on the near-term horizon. The Fed is only tapering to avoid a situation where they are forced to raise rates to combat inflation, without having tapered first. In a global economy that is highly levered with consumer, corporate, and fiscal debts, along with financial and real asset valuations being at historical valuation levels, a material rise in interest rates is likely to weigh heavily on debt rollovers, which weighs on profits. Furthermore, as interest rates rise, they present an alternative to risk assets, which can weigh heavily on valuations. We had a 40-year bull market in bonds that has appeared to have leveled off, as the USA is not set up for negative nominal interest rates, even if real yields are currently negative. If the Fed must aggressively combat inflation, interest rates are the only tool in their bag as we know it. Ask former Fed Chairman Paul Volker how that went in the late 1970\u2019s and early 1980\u2019s.\n\n3.  Intense speculation, or as former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke famously stated, \u201cirrational exuberance\u201d. It does not take much effort to scan the financial markets and find large swaths of intense speculation. A few to note include the ever-persisting emergence of SPACs, the GameStop, Nokia, Blackberry, dodge coin, and other debacles, excessive use of trading margin that is bordering all-time highs, intense call option volume across indices and individual stocks, the heavy emergence of novice retail traders, an entirely imprudent reliance on the Fed, and overall earnings, revenue, and PEG multiples that are unsightly. The only thing that is in the equity markets favor is that the bigger bubble is centered in bonds, as rates have been artificially suppressed by FOMC activities. And you will regularly hear market pundits quote this as the bullish case for equity markets. The \u201cthere is no other alternative to stocks argument\u201d. The \u201ctwo different investment classes are expensive, but one is more expensive so buy up the less expensive\u201d investment thesis could prove to be a painful one. Perhaps though, one of the most concerning aspects of this intensely speculative environment is that the market has entirely disconnected from the traditional aspects of finance. I am regularly witnessing market participants conflate \u201coperations returning to normal in a post-pandemic world\u201d to \u201cthis company will return to the same level of profitability as in 2019, during the pre-pandemic world\u201d. This is a clutching for straws argument. For example, Live Nation\u2019s common stock has risen over 33% from its pre-pandemic levels, despite taking on $3.2 billion in additional debt during the pandemic, burning insane amounts of cash monthly, and setting themselves up for their 2022 interest expense to be in line with 2019 annual profits, effectively wiping out profitability on a back-tested model. There are so many cases of this throughout the market, where financial sense has failed to prevail. \n\n4.  Highly concerning levels of zombie companies are hiding in the Russel 2000 index. A zombie company is a clich\u00e9 coined phrase, but it refers to companies that have such deteriorated balance sheets, and often similarly inadequate business models, that they are incredibly unlikely to ever see profitability. In prior research I performed in the second quarter of 2020, I evidenced about 30% of the Russel 2000 was comprised of zombie companies. The real reason for this is excessively low interest rates have allowed for incredibly lessened WACC (cost of capital) to where these companies continue to take on more corporate bonds and notes, while never servicing any of the debt principal. This is a cancer on the overall economy, as the free market fails to efficiently allocate capital, largely because the market is flooded with liquidity. If you are looking for a \u201cBlack Swan event\u201d that could bring this market to its knees, the Russel 2000 isn\u2019t a bad place to have a look around.\n\n5.  Fiscal spending that seriously places concern on the dollar\u2019s ability to maintain reserve currency status. The dollar\u2019s reserve status is the kingpin of US financial prosperity. Approximately 70 percent of the world\u2019s global debt is repaid in dollars, so demand has historically been there. However, the irresponsible fiscal actions of the United States have caused many to question the dollar\u2019s future status. Look no further than the SDR\u2019s and other financial instruments that are being used oversees to circumvent trading with the dollar, including between Russia and China regarding petrol.\n\n6.  Democratic party is proposing changes of taxation that could seriously impact corporate profitability, investor sentiment, and overall transactional actions. Proposed changes include raising the corporate tax rate to 26% to 27%, a large increase in capital gains tax rates, the implementation of an unrealized gain tax on the ultra-wealthy investors, who often have high exposures to equity holdings, and other costly propositions. \n\n7.  An interesting reason I recommend hedging your portfolio now is the relative price of the Volatility Index (VIX) versus the growing level of risks or headwinds facing equity markets. With the VIX trading at approximately $16 or so, near the long-term historical average, portfolio insurance in the form of options become more attractive, given the lowered price level of premiums. When volatility is tamped down or acting tamed, portfolio insurance cost typically lessens. Now is not a bad time to lock in portfolio insurance to hedge long positions, if one is not willing to risk triggering a taxable event through selling or exit the market entirely, risking not capturing further upside gains.\n\nTo hedge a reasonable amount of risk, I am looking to the SPY $350 strike put option expiring on January 20, 2023, trading at $13.03 to hedge approximately 14 to 15 months of long SPY or equity market exposure. A reasonable position would be 2% to 5% of total portfolio value in this long put position.","5":"100% way to know when the bull market is over Everyone talks about Tesla being bigger than every major automobile company, electric vehicle company, and almost every electric battery company put together as a way to tell the bubble is close.\n\nOthers explore the alternative coins market and how much money is involved in each and say this is how you tell the peak.\n\nSome speak of inflation worries and rate hikes.\n\nSome others talk about how the markets have descended into short-busting hedonism with no comprehension if a company is remotely decent or not...

I believe in the company and the science behind their drug, simufilam. Shit's going to be worth tons in the next 2-3 years.\n\nRecently, the company was targeted by nefarious short sellers. The stock's price got destroyed, but that's a good thing for new investors because it gives you the opportunity to get in at a cheap price.

The shorts are going to be in pain.\n\nThe company's board sold no shares even at the top, so there's a clear belief on their part in their company. This gave me a ton of confidence, frankly. But, the data behind the drug's efficacy is astounding. It gives me more confidence, and some semblance of hope for people with Alzheimer's. When this shit gets approved by the FDA and Biden gets a chance at maintaining his sanity through simufilam, then the stock will go berserk. You know how GME went berserk? I'm not saying this is the next GME cause there will be nothing like GME in such a short span of time, but SAVA will be madness too.

Prices move up and down depending on whatever whoever is willing to pay. If a stock rises so much sellers come in and drop the price, if it falls to much buyers come in and pick up the price. If every single person puts a $100 order for a $1 stock but there are no selling orders $100 is the new price. Every other thing you hear about the market are attempts at justification for those prices, cashflow discount, dividend discount, P\/E, EPS, all mumbo jumbo to try to make sense of why A trades for more than B. It is also why you see \u201cMEME\u201d stocks trade at traditional mind boggling prices\/valuations, because it just boils down to what someone is willing to pay for those shares and the majority agree that AMC should trade north of $35 and GME over $150.\n\n Making a MEME\n\nThere are a few key points that contribute into turning a stock into a MEME Stock. The stock must be recognizable to have staying power. In order for the MEME to stay a MEME and hold its price, it has to be a company people have heard about or MSM (Main Street Media) have or will cover heavily. Secondly America loves a Comeback, and so does the market\/Members, the stock has to be heavily beat down if a narrative about how its business was destroyed by Covid that\u2019s a double plus. Finally the stock has to have a very low float or highly shorted, I would contend the first point is magnitudes more important. With these 3 points in our mind lets dive into who the target is. \n\nFrankenstein\u2019s Monster \n\nWework was once a shining Jewel in the Softbank investment portfolio, investing at least $18.5 billion in WeWork since 2017, including $6 billion when a fundraising round valued the startup at $47 billion in January 2019(1). But governance and profitability concerns in addition to a disaster IPO lead to their $47B valuation getting chopped down to nearly $10B in oct 2019 (2). Over this time MSM loves to take about WeWork it was a darling that got absolutely obliterated, can you imagine if it went on a monster AMC\/GME run, point 1 check. Wework\u2019s primary business is real estate, they buy\/renovate office space and then sublease this same workspace to multiple companies or share of whole offices for 1 largely customer. Covid19 has dramatically changed the work\/life balance, we are going on almost 2 years of the pandemic where most white collar has been done remotely or at home. Now with labor holding a lot of the cards the ability to work from anywhere for at least for 2-3 a week the traditional office model is being disrupted. A fundamental argument can be made that WeWork\u2019s business is about to experience a renaissance driven by the Covid 19 pandemic as corporation adopt smaller satellite offices since more staff can work remotely or at home. If you watch CNBC you may have caught David Faber mention the \u201cSPAC POP\u201d which is a sudden increase in the SPAC price when the deal closes due to a large 95 or greater percent redemption of space shares. Due to point 1 and 2 I expect the \/Wework Spac to have an insanely high redemption rate maybe 98%, this will result in a super low float. \n\n\n\nGamma Gameplan \n\nOne of the most potent tools in the MEME trader arsenal is the long naked call option. The call option gives you the right but not the obligation to purchase 100 shares at a price you choose. A market maker sells you this call for a premium which is determined by a number of factors such as length of time, difference in price, volatility of the stock, etc. Now MM\u2019s have a number of ways they can neutralize the risk to selling these options, 1 of which is buying the underlying stock, so that as the stock rises so does their share price thus offsetting their losses. The other option would be buying a higher strike so cap their losses. I believe a GAMMA Blitz can be executed around the SPAC POP in order to drive the stock price up. For Example the vote to close the Wework SPAC is set for Oct 19, if passed Wework shares will start to trade on Oct 21. The nearest call option for  is the Nov 19 call with the highest strike being the 17.5. If enough of these calls are sold there is currently no higher strike for MM\u2019s to hedge with, they would have to buy the underlying stock to cover themselves, but this will move the price significantly since the float will be dramatically reduced due to the high redemption. \n\nI am targeting a share price over $20 by Nov 1st. This is not financial advice or a call to action, I am simply sharing my thoughts and ideas, please invest\/trade at your own discretion.","12":"$ROOT DD: Breakout Confirmed and High Probability Setup to be $15\/share Price Target (+200% gain)  To my fellow WSB investors,\n\nI would like to share with this community a high probability short squeeze set up play to $GME and $AMC based on fundamental and technical rationale. I am constantly monitoring short set up tickers on Fintwit, WSB, etc. (I keep a technical record & alert) as they've gotten popular and I have finally found a set up that is fundamentally sound- meaning high ROI, high probability, and low % of risk. These setups take time and most of the time, a long ass time. This is not a YOLO, HODL, etc. play and I never thought that $GME and $AMC were ever these types of plays. This is key as you are able to average down and hold safely for long term compounded gains.\n\nRoot Insurance ($ROOT) has finally made it to the top of my list as my highest conviction play this year. I've watched and played tickers like $MVIS, $CLOV, and now $SDC (all of these tickers are short term momo plays), but I strongly believe $ROOT is a technical\/fundamental stock that emulates $GME\/$AMC in the long term. I want to make sure you all understand that one of the main reasons why $GME\/$AMC was so successful was because they're both high conviction \"marathon\" plays and not \"sprints\". This is what differentiates $ROOT vs. other ticker plays because it is currently a \"marathon\" play.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat is a marathon play that will lead to a high probability setup, high ROI, and low risk on investment? You need to have been present and study the fundamentals of $GME\/$AMC vs. all other short term tickers that pumped and then dumped. The reasons why $GME\/$AMC were successful and why $ROOT is setup to do the same are:\n\n1. High Conviction: The investors need to believe and be confident that they can hold these stocks until their price targets have been met. This is through stocks being fundamentally undervalued, vengeance, high risk\/reward, M&A, retail business familiarity (i.e. AMC theatres, Gamestop shop), etc. You need high conviction as when scalpers or hedge funds sell and change the momentum downwards, high conviction investors do not sell but are able to hold (we believe in long term gains).\n2. High Institutional Ownership: As much as $GME\/$AMC were shorted by hedge funds, they also had a high % of institutional investors. This is absolutely needed as they are able to hold a significant amount of the total outstanding float over a long period of time. Then this just leaves the shares float and the short float as a percentage of the shares float. i.e. $GME at times had ownership levels greater than 100% which confirmed naked shorting and FTD's taking place by short hedge funds.\n3. High Short Interest: Short Interest needs to be above 25% of the float at the minimum.\n4. Partnership or Benefactor: You need to have a benefactor or partner (high profile) who is willing to create support (large volume entry price) or hard carry\/pull the price up if needed, especially on dips. Deepfuckingvalue is the sponsor for $GME and $AMC has Trey\/CEO\/Mark Cuban, etc.\n5. Fundamentals: Retail was already very familiar with AMC theatres and Gamestop stores. Fundamentals didn't matter as much because the price levels were so low due to Covid depressed demand. However, fundamentals like cash on hand, book value, Price\/book value, Price\/cash, revenue, net income, earnings, future earnings are all relevant. This is how you are able to determine floor prices or value for companies, future price targets, gauge risk vs. reward, compare similar industry companies to one another, etc.\n6. Technicals: $GME\/$AMC were marathon plays and the squeeze didn't happen overnight (90% preparation\/10% execution). What we noticed was high volatility in buying\/selling, but every single dip was being bought- this created higher conviction holders day after day which reduced the amount of share float to be traded which created less of the float to be able to be shorted significantly. The short ladder attacks was also challenging to overcome, but we overcame it over time. Over a period of time, less and less shares were available to be shorted and we also noticed higher failure to delivers (FTD's) in which hedge funds were not returning borrowed shares (i.e. naked shorting). WSB caught this and made hedge funds pay. ITM\/OTM call options were also being bought heavily which meant the shorts had to delta hedge or make sure they had the shares available in case the call expired ITM.\n\n[$AMC\\\/$GME Squeeze Comparison](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/aa7kcvn8sft71.png?width=1019&format=png&auto=webp&s=b19fb4e4cf800cdbd2d477ec5d20095452608fd8)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[$AMC FTD](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/zmqx4i1jsft71.png?width=991&format=png&auto=webp&s=9bd529f4f1ed5db964d84756a24564f4909f929f)\n\n7. Hooke's Law: \"*The force exerted on a spring is directly proportional to the distance it moves as a result of the force*.\" Just like how a highly compressed spring works, overtime the amount of compression\/tension that was applied to the spring released and caused the greatest of short squeezes. The more time it takes to compress a spring, the farther it will jump.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\n**To my fellow WSB investors, now for the explanation on $ROOT (I'm taking this information from other sources on WSB as well).**\n\nRoot is a 6 year old car insurance tech company that uses telematics (collecting locational data and machine learning to make decisions) to decide which drivers they would like to insure\/not insure. The more data they gather, the better decisions they'll be making to improve their loss ratio (profitability from charging premiums vs. paying out money which is an insurer's business model). Getting approval is difficult and it's state by state but they're approved in 32 States now. They also have an enterprise division which is the tech\/telematics division of the company and is able to offer software as a service (SaaS). They are supplying their data to fleet management companies as well as other insurers which is another revenue stream.\n\nRoot had their IPO in late 2020 at $27\/share and a $6.7B market cap. As of 10\/8, they closed at $5\/share (-81.4%) and $1.27B market cap. Per Finviz, their sales are $260M\/yr, net income of $-500M\/yr, book\/share value of 3.06, price\/book of 1.63, cash\/share value of 3.76, and price\/share value of 1.33. The net income is negative due to the high OpEx (operational expenditure on marketing, etc.). Fundamentally based on the amount of cash they have ($1.0B), they are undervalued based on their P\/B and P\/C compared to other insur-tech companies. They also have 249M total shares outstanding, 97M shares float, and a short float % of 34% although their most recent Fintel\/FINRA Dark Pool Short Volume is 53%. Per Yahoo finance, Root has 75% of the float held by institutions at\/above $11\/share! These institutions like Silver Lake Group and Tiger Global are technology based institutions (they know what they're doing investing in tech). With Root currently being #4 in highest shorted stocks, their FTD's also confirm that they're continuously being shorted. June\/July\/August 2021 had the highest amount of FTD's (naked shorting) with the highest being over 3M ($20M) shares at one time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[$ROOT Fundamentals](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/oeq3j4vlsft71.png?width=703&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c6246e932cf4464d7c991765f80d374310915e9)\n\n[Fintel\\\/FINRA Dark Pool Short Volume at 53&#37;](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/6pgx9tjdoft71.png?width=1777&format=png&auto=webp&s=a775605c9c7bcfd06fcc94098e2f59d7215eca85)\n\n[Yahoo Finance Major Institutional Investor Breakdown](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/dupk2o4hoft71.png?width=1352&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb446a9a105bf3c3324c3bbeb0d61c85036bf171)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Shares Failed to Deliver \\(From Fintel\\)](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/2o4eun8rsft71.png?width=1781&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc20905552f868da77299e7f9a6380c265430118)\n\nAs of 10\/12\/21, Carvana has confirmed investing $126M at $9\/share (SEC Form 3- exercisable at any time and no expiration) for 11% equity (increased from 5%) in the business + a 5 year commercial partnership. Root has also issued 8 short\/long term warrants exercisable at $10-$30\/share and up to 129M shares of Class A common stock which represents 30% of Root ownership. As WSB already pointed out, this is a strong assumption that an acquisition could take place in the near future. I consider Carvana to be Root's benefactor. Their latest catalyst on 10\/12\/21 also included a 7% overall investment of outstanding shares by Schusterman Interests.\n\nTechnicals are self explanatory on this 1 year 1 day chart. This is a 1 year falling wedge pattern (beautiful!) with an RSI at 30-35 and an imminent breakout. You cannot get a chart as beautiful\/predictable as this.

There is a high uncertainty that these options will expire worthless as hedge funds pin the price to collect the premiums that are high IV.

The reasoning is due to high conviction long term holders, high institutional ownership (75% of float) at an average price >$11\/share, high short interest at 35% and 52% on dark pool data, benefactor\/partnership with Carvana where an M&A above 30% equity is possible, fundamentally undervalued based on price\/book of 1.66 and price\/cash of 1.33, technically on a yearly falling wedge\/imminent breakout setup, and Hooke's Law where this setup is a highly compressed loaded spring.

Trends for orthodontics (increasing demand)**\n\nBased on the growth of orthodontic-related companies, the demand for orthodontics is growing explosively around the world, and $SDC also has explosive growth potential in this trend.\u200b\n\nLet's take a look at some of the very important companies involved.\n\n....**(1). ALGN (Align Technology)**\n\n$ALGN is in the business of developing, manufacturing and selling orthodontic 3D printers.\n\nIt is amazing to see the growth of this company.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/cgme1ae094t71.png?width=1234&format=png&auto=webp&s=38e1a65da40402d87932df5be28bead49c928bb6\n\nThe stock price has risen 58527 % from its lowest point ($1.26) to the maximum ($737.45), and is currently at $643.56, up 51076 %.\n\nNumber of shares: 79.01 M\n\nMarket cap: 50803 M $\n\n....**(2). XRAY (Dentsplay Sinora)**\n\n$XRAY is also in the business of developing and selling dental equipment in addition to orthodontic 3D printers.\n\nThe growth rate of this company is also surprising.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/5xob4n5194t71.png?width=1240&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d30b10c2d58957d678859f436b83ce5b798d70c\n\nIt reached the high of $69.54, which is 13120 % higher than the low of $0.53, and is now 10949% higher at $58.03.\n\nNumber of shares: 218.55 M\n\nMarket cap: 12682.46 M $\n\nIn addition to this, the main tickers are\n\n\\* Henry Schein (NASDAQ:HSIC)\n\n\\* 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD)\n\netc., but I'll skip these.\n\nEven dental care\/treatment around the world is expensive, so unless you are upper-middle class or higher, you have not been able to straighten your teeth well. In particular, there **were** many negative views on corrections for beauty.\n\nHowever, the explosive growth of orthodontic equipment companies,\n\nSeeing that orthodontic for beauty are now increasingly popular with the young generation in many countries,\n\nDemand for orthodontics has exploded in recent years and is expected to increase in the future.\n\n..**2). the importance of price**\n\nOrthodontic at SDC is generally much cheaper than actual visits.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/sy97rxb294t71.png?width=631&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ee9eecc22555d2309e75ca6a39122f3252f29a4\n\nIn addition, due to the pandemic, masks have become commonplace and the frequency of going out has greatly decreased.\n\nAt this time when people are not showing their teeth, more and more people want to have orthodontic treatment, and SDC has a very strong advantage in this regard.\n\nFor this expensive orthodontic treatment to **become common**, it must not be too burdensome for the middle class to afford.\n\nAnd SDC is one of the most affordable solutions,\n\n**I think SmileDirectClub will lead the way among companies that make orthodontics universal for beauty in the future.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/gxia739394t71.png?width=1301&format=png&auto=webp&s=199d252b1f65280620b3bf2f37e6eb325ceb4776\n\nGet a smile with just 3$ per day!\n\n..**3).

I think this has a big impact on showing good results in marketing as well.\n\nSince this orthodontic treatment is highly likely to become a trend from the young generation, reviews and promotions through SNS will spread very quickly during the transition period when orthodontic treatment becomes common. In fact, SDC can easily find promotional materials on SNS, Youtube, and TV.\n\nPoor operating profit is one of the biggest causes of recent short selling attacks, and in fact, ignorant 'self-proclaimed analysts' cite operating profit as the reason for 'the reason you should not buy SDC'.\n\nBut the reason why the operating profit is currently poor is largely due to the cost of plant expansion, new patent development, and business expansion into new countries.\n\n\\--------------------ref----------------------------\n\nItem 2.

We believe ASP is an indicator of the value we provide to our members and our ability to maintain our pricing. Our ASP for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $1,797 and $1,771, respectively. Our ASP is less than our standard $1,950 price as a result of discounts offered to select members.\n\n( Reference : File number 21907839 , 10-Q, page : 57 )\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe core business element of SDC presented in 10-Q is to secure a large number of orders, and recently sales are good and capacity is increasing, so operating profit is negative.\n\n..**4). Alabama State Dental Association is so territorial but Fair Trade Commission recognized SDC business.**\n\nSDC was planning to expand into Alabama, but the Alabama Dental Association requested SDC to stop remote\/visual orthodontic diagnosis and treatment, and SDC abandoned its expansion plan to Alabama.\n\nHowever, the Fair Trade Commission said that this was an unreasonable request and violated the antitrust law and that SmileDirectClub's business was justified as a result of a 5-0 vote.\n\n[https:\/\/www.ftc.gov\/news-events\/press-releases\/2021\/09\/alabama-board-dental-examiners-agrees-settle-ftc-charges-it](https:\/\/www.ftc.gov\/news-events\/press-releases\/2021\/09\/alabama-board-dental-examiners-agrees-settle-ftc-charges-it)\n\nAlabama Board of Dental Examiners Agrees to Settle FTC Charges that It Unreasonably Excluded Lower Cost Online and Teledentistry Providers from Competition\n\nTo settle FTC charges that its actions violated the antitrust laws, the Board of Dental Examiners of Alabama has agreed to stop requiring on-site supervision by licensed dentists of alignment scans of prospective patients\u2019 mouths seeking to address misaligned teeth or gaps between teeth.\n\nSDC is fighting these existing dental associations' territory and regulations,\n\nI sent an inquiry email to SDC regarding these.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/q01nub1694t71.png?width=1581&format=png&auto=webp&s=f132df1bdbf9f2a8d94bee213aa8cf7faa81178a\n\nIn this regard, SDC received a reply that it would deal with it in more detail when it released 3Q earnings.\n\n..**5). $SDC is the only Tele-Dentistry company listed on Nasdaq**\n\nThe link below is a list of US Tele-Dentistry companies, and SmileDirectClub is the only listed company.\n\n[https:\/\/www.beckersdental.com\/teledentistry\/36105-10-teledentistry-companies-to-know.html](https:\/\/www.beckersdental.com\/teledentistry\/36105-10-teledentistry-companies-to-know.html)\n\nThis means that there is no competition for $SDC in the Nasdaq market, there is sufficient liquidity to invest in marketing,\n\nIt is the best company that can monopolize a percentage of the Tele-Dentistry market.\n\n**2. Issues with SmileDirectClub**\n\n..**1). Legal issues with NBC ( CNBC ).**\n\nLast year, SDC filed a $2.85 billion lawsuit alleging that NBC deliberately distorted SDC.\n\n[https:\/\/www.hollywoodreporter.com\/business\/business-news\/smiledirectclub-sues-nbc-285-billion-1295347\/](https:\/\/www.hollywoodreporter.com\/business\/business-news\/smiledirectclub-sues-nbc-285-billion-1295347\/)\n\nThe lawsuit is still ongoing. If SDC win, it is possible to secure a huge amount of funds with strong recognition.\n\n..**2). Short-Squeuze play on Reddit**\n\nBased on the content of my previous post about the possibility of short squeeze and the general information above, reports that I was trying to play a short squeeze on Reddit.\n\n[https:\/\/twitter.com\/KristinaParts\/status\/1437884294249201669?s=19](https:\/\/twitter.com\/KristinaParts\/status\/1437884294249201669?s=19)\n\nGME, AMC, and then SDC, MEMEs started to become popular.\n\n..**3). Analyst raises target price**\n\nBelow is Analyst's upward revision of the $SDC target price (starting price of $5.25 -> target price of $11)\n\n[https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StockSDC\/comments\/pz36eg\/credit\\_suisse\\_analyst\\_matt\\_miksic\\_gives\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StockSDC\/comments\/pz36eg\/credit_suisse_analyst_matt_miksic_gives\/)\n\n**3. Danger**\n\nThe short-term risks of SDC are hard to find out now. So let's take a look at three long-term risks.\n\n..**1). Risks from audits after exiting emerging growth companies**\n\nSDC, as an emerging growth company, receives exceptions from audits, and if sales exceed 1.08 B, it will be eliminated from the emerging growth company, and there is a high risk of being attacked by short selling according to financial reporting.\n\nIn fact, according to the investment prospectus of SDC, it is possible to speculate that the current sales are intentionally lowered to some extent because the company intends to take full advantage of the advantages of 'emerging growth companies'. It is a story of the distant future. No need to worry right now.\n\n..**2). Possibility of dilution of Class A common stock by pre-IPO investors**\n\nThe number of issued shares is 118.87 M , the current share price is 6.5 dollars, and the current market capitalization is 773 M $ ( 972 billion won).\n\nThe total number of diluted shares including pre-IPO investor volume (common share B) is 387,61 M.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/0v6zqi8894t71.png?width=1277&format=png&auto=webp&s=d12cad7c7cf680cef8d008bb15a5db1ed0d64f51\n\nReference : 10-Q, page 1\n\nThe lock-up release date for common stock B was released on August 16, 19, 180 days after the submission of S-1.\n\nSo far, a total of 1.2M common stock B has been diluted with common stock A.\n\nClass A change: 104,825,858 -> 118,869,656\n\nClass B change: 281,863,766 -> 269,243,501\n\n**Even after the lockup was lifted, the conversion of common stock B to common stock A was only diluted by 4.5%, a small amount for a year and a half. Moreover, considering the diluted unit price (over $10), the current share price is $6.5, so the possibility of a share price decline due to the dilution of common stock B is very low.**\n\n..**3). Redemption of convertible bonds**\n\nThe convertible bonds issued on February 9, 21st had a conversion rate of 55.3710 shares per 1000$ conversion rate, and were converted to the common share A price of $18.06 per share.\n\nAccording to the contents of convertible bonds, the bill is due on February 1, 26, and from August 1, 25, the issuer of the note can request redemption.\n\nIn addition, according to the will of the company, from February 6, 24, if the stock price at that time is higher than the stock price when the bill was issued, early redemption is possible.\n\nTherefore, the possibility that SDC's common stock A will be diluted due to convertible bonds is a very distant future, and it is not something to be concerned about much at present.\n\n\\------------------------ref---------------------------------\n\nItem 1.01.\n\nEntry into a Material Definitive Agreement.\n\nIndenture and Notes\n\nOn February 9, 2021, SmileDirectClub, Inc. (the \u201cCompany\u201d) entered into an indenture (the \u201cIndenture\u201d), between the Company and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee (the \u201cTrustee\u201d), pursuant to which the Company issued $650,000,000 principal amount of the Company's 0.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (the \u201cNotes\u201d). The Company has also granted the initial purchasers of the Notes an option to purchase, for settlement within a 13-day period beginning on, and including, the date on which the Notes were first issued, up to an additional $97,500,000 aggregate principal amount of the Notes (\u201cOption Notes\u201d). On February 9, 2021, the initial purchasers exercised their option to purchase $70,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Option Notes.\n\nThe Notes will be the Company\u2019s senior, unsecured obligations and will be (i) equal in right of payment with the Company\u2019s existing and future senior, unsecured indebtedness; (ii) senior in right of payment to the Company\u2019s existing and future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated to the Notes; (iii) effectively subordinated to the Company\u2019s existing and future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing that indebtedness; and (iv) structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities, including our credit facility and trade payables, and (to the extent the Company is not a holder thereof) preferred equity, if any, of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries.\n\nThe Notes will not bear regular interest, and the principal amount of the Notes will not accrete. The Notes will mature on February 1, 2026, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. Before August 1, 2025, noteholders will have the right to convert their Notes only upon the occurrence of certain events. From and after August 1, 2025, noteholders may convert their Notes at any time at their election until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date. The Company will settle conversions by paying or delivering, as applicable, cash, shares of its Class A common stock or a combination of cash and shares of its Class A common stock, at the Company\u2019s election. The initial conversion rate is 55.3710 shares of Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $18.06 per share of Class A common stock. The conversion rate and conversion price will be subject to customary adjustments upon the occurrence of certain events in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. In addition, if certain corporate events that constitute a \u201cMake-Whole Fundamental Change\u201d (as defined in the Indenture) occur, then the conversion rate will, in certain circumstances, be increased for a specified period of time.\n\nThe Notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part, at the Company's option at any time, and from time to time, on or after February 6, 2024 and on or before the 40th scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, at a cash redemption price equal to the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid special interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, but only if the last reported sale price per share of the Company's Class A common stock exceeds 130% of the conversion price on (i) each of at least 20 trading days, whether or not consecutive, during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the trading day immediately before the date the Company sends the related redemption notice; and (ii) the trading day immediately before the date the Company sends such notice. In addition, calling any Note for redemption will constitute a Make-Whole Fundamental Change with respect to that Note, in which case the conversion rate applicable to the conversion of that Note will be increased in certain circumstances if it is converted after it is called for redemption.\n\nIf certain corporate events that constitute a \u201cFundamental Change\u201d (as defined in the Indenture) occur, then, then noteholders may require the Company to repurchase their Notes at a cash repurchase price equal to the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid special interest, if any, to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. The definition of Fundamental Change includes certain business combination transactions involving the Company and certain de-listing events with respect to the Company\u2019s Class A common stock.\n\n(Reference:\n\n[https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/0001775625\/000110465921016943\/tm214449d4\\_8k.htm](https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/0001775625\/000110465921016943\/tm214449d4_8k.htm))\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**4. Conclusions and considerations**\n\n**$SDC This is on the movement, not a moment.**\n\nThe demand for orthodontics is explosively popular all over the world, and SDC is a company that has great advantages. It is also the largest company in the Tele-Dentistry industry and is the only listed company on Nasdaq.\n\nIn view of the move to continuously increase marketing and production capacity,\n\nSDC is a company with great potential to continue increasing its market share by leading the future Online & Tele-Dentistry, and believes that its share price will rise by at least several hundred% in the next few years.\n\nWhen 3Q earnings are announced in November, no one knows whether the short selling will be more aggressive or if the results will exceed expectations and result in an earnings surprise.\n\nThere is one more thing to remember. Long position institutions have already formed strong support at $5, and there has never been any class B dilution near this price range. Therefore, we believe that the current share price is more safe than risky.\n\nIn the short term, there is a high possibility that the stock price will rise quickly due to the pressure on short selling.\n\nIf a squeeze occurs in order to maximize profits (to hold as many shares of $SDC as possible in the long term), as explained in Chapter 3. Risk, there is a factor that will decrease in the long run, so some of them will be forced to sell. , I think it would be good to collect stocks steadily over the long term.\n\nps. I am not a financial advisor, and the content of this post is my personal opinion and not a buy\/sell recommendation.","16":"$ROOT, Win the Marathon and Upcoming Catalyst  \n\nROOT is the definition of playing the long game which I always said I was playing with ROOT. We do have some upcoming interesting events that could propel it forward in the short to medium termt though. I've summarized below to share with you.\n\nIn the updated $Carvana and $ROOT Commercial Agreement they state that the Product Integration Plan will be completed within 30 days from commencement date which is Oct 1st. If Carvana buying up to 30% of the company for prices up to 6x the current share price doesn't excite you, then I do not know what will! Root issued this 30% in 8 short\/long term warrants exercisable at $10-$30\/share and up to 129M shares of Class A common stock which represents the 30% of Root ownership fully diluted as of Aug 2021. As we have seen posted many time, there is a strong assumption that an acquisition could take place in the near future.\n\nRoot is aware they need to reduce costs and are doing so both on the selling and general admin cost side but also by using their new tech, i.e. UBI 4.0. Expect to hear about these results soon.\n\nLook I don't know what is going to happen, but Root looks primed for the long term turn around darling backed by Carvana. If we could get a solid retail base it would speed up the increased share price. I'm looking for $27+ which was the IPO price only 1 year ago.\n\n**Possible catalysts:**\n\n**- Technical Analysis**\n\nThis is a 1 year falling wedge pattern lets break it out!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[1Y1D Falling Wedge](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/4ostsgreq1t71.png?width=1923&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ea8f3587fa2879efac2afbe984b4b5edd0175f1)\n\n1Y1D Falling Wedge\n\n**- Oct 15th Call Expiration**\n\nMassive open interest for expiration this Friday, mainly out of the money though.

A good amount of these questionable price actions can be spotted just by looking at the 1-minute to 5-minute price charts with volume. You can see that volume is generally consistent throughout the day but as the price gets closer to a major support price level, sudden extremely large sell orders tend to appear out of nowhere just to push the price through support and then suddenly disappear. I started to notice this issue for TLRY about 2 months ago as it wasn't the case earlier. \n\nI sense that this has to do with short sellers so I started to do a little digging and this is what I have found: \n\n[Yes, Citadel is involved](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/5ndscitmpvq71.png?width=1681&format=png&auto=webp&s=1585a48c981e8a67d2651a38e98c85c8fba624bc)\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/pb2a11dopvq71.png?width=1624&format=png&auto=webp&s=e5c88604ec72975d95b17b6aba7534ebd85627b3\n\nAs indicated above, both Citadel and Susquehanna have started taking large short positions in TLRY. Keep in mind that these companies are required to file 13Fs within 45 days of their transactions and as these numbers were only the disclosures in August (Which was when these mini sell volume spikes started), the total short interest amounts could currently be considerably higher. It is also publicly known that institutional short sellers have been reducing their short positions before short interest filing dates and increasing back their short positions after the filing date in order to stay under the radar. Who wants to bet that these guys are actually doing that? \n\nKeep in mind this is also a double edged sword, as they will be more vulnerable to a short squeeze. \n\nI also want to highlight that Bank of America this morning just randomly downgraded CGC (One of Tilray's Top Peers) pushing the entire sector down. This is at the same time when other analysts actually upgraded CGC which makes BOA's rating stand out quite a bit. As you can see BOA above just started to increase its short positions in Tilray in August as well. \n\nIt seems that TLRY is the biggest target in the public cannabis space since it is the most liquid and actually traded on a real American exchange with the largest volume in the space. This is why even though nothing but good news is coming out of Tilray and the cannabis sector overall, the stock goes down on times when it shouldn't. \n\nThese are the people are you are playing against and as we know from stocks like GME or AMC, companies like Citadel just don't play fair.","25":"Daily Popular Tickers Thread for October 01, 2021 - GME | AMC | BBBY \nYour daily hype and or containment thread.

I'm back with a play you all can relate to...but first, here's the summary and re-introduction.\n\n**TL;DR:** Dole just went public, trades cheaply vs. peers, and sells bananas, other fruits, and veggies. Apes eat all of the above. Options just opened up two weeks ago and will accelerate the multiple re-rating as institutions and apes buy DOLE and the multiple normalizes, share price rises, and we all enjoy tendie flavored bananas over the coming months\/years.\n\n**About me:** Some OGs (as in, pre-January mania) may remember me as the **GMEdd** dot com **$169.42 PT** guy that was invested in GME for longer than our friend u\/DeepFuckingValue and made several podcasts + appearances on Bloomberg, Benzinga, etc. I shared some DD with WSB [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/k34e7x\/gme_yolo_roth_ira\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/kknuk6\/gme_icr_conference_words_matter\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/krdqp5\/gme_4q20_financial_model_update\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) etc...you get the fucking point.

We're talking about a literal ape play: the world's largest producer of fresh produce, newly IPOed Dole Plc. (DOLE):\n\n[North American & European exposure to Bananas & Various Fruits & Vegetables](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/gwqt341udcq71.png?width=1168&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e8bfd8b5037afe214b1f627290b6fbe59c20bf7)\n\n[Share Leader in Key Categories; Growth Opportunity in Higher Margin Value-Added Produce](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/5abh528ydcq71.png?width=626&format=png&auto=webp&s=00eb4fbc38da6b89aebb19d472d7dd8adf18e9ac)\n\nFor those of you care about the details, dig into this [excellent analysis by ValueSits](https:\/\/valuesits.substack.com\/p\/total-produce-plc-dole-food-company) laying out the entire landscape. I'll translate a few key points into ret...ape:\n\n* Dole Plc, global #1 player in fresh produce by a wide margin, is the product of a merger between Total Produce Plc and Dole Food Company that then went public to refinance & de-lever combined entity's debt\n* Upside opportunity ranges from 2x-3x current levels in 12-24 months, while downside risk appears limited, around the \\~$14\/share level  \n* Synergies expected to improve combined Dole Plc's EBITDA by \\~10%, with mid single digit growth going forward. **At its core this is a mispriced security, not a growth play.**\n\nSo there we have it; Dole returned to public markets two months ago on the back of a merger with UK based Total Produce that has yielded an absolute King Kong-sized player, currently priced like Diddy. The IPO went poorly, trading down \\~9%, and the price closed yesterday at $15.02. Why might the IPO have gone poorly?\n\n* IPO fatigue (IPO volumes this year on track to surpass the dotcom peak of $97B, per Renaissance Capital, in particular volumes were elevated around Dole's IPO (\\~$10B that week alone)\n* Weak investor roadshow and IPO occurred during a quiet Summer period\n* Apes were not given a lifetime supply of bananas for being part of the IPO (okay, not really)\n\nNow Uberkikz11, you may ask, why will the price go higher? Institutional ownership is low and will rise over time as Dole will be eligible for inclusion in the Russell 2000 and S&P Small Cap 600 indices with its current \\~$1.4B market cap. This plays out over the next year. Also, options trading opened less than two weeks ago, and has extremely low open interest and implied volatility... if apes go bananas, well, the re-rating will go ever faster. Notably, I pointed this out to some GME OGs yesterday and it appears that option volume has already begun to rise, with more calls traded yesterday than since options trading began. I'm sure it's nothing.\n\n[S&P Capital IQ shows \\~13&#37; Institutional Ownership, to Rise Upon Index Inclusion](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/jtfl4mxbgcq71.png?width=2830&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6e4db79e03675ce05d05d14ea106361a683c1af)\n\n[Options trading has just opened up, with a cheap IV by WSB standards](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/lcs3zj8zccq71.png?width=2680&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed08d2acb9f6bcb2e1b7cd1e449288dbf6195b0b)\n\n[Significant Discount to Peer Group Expected to Close Over Time](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/1utxczmdjcq71.png?width=861&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e6ee02967d441a46b05f97583f2e374896ee7cb)\n\nA few other points:\n\n* Analyst coverage is just getting underway, and so far 12mo price targets range from $15-$26\/share\n* Inflation risk is minimal as the vertically integrated DOLE will pass through costs to end buyers (retailers, wholesalers)... indeed, with its scale advantage I expect DOLE to outperform smaller peers in this regard\n* Prior IPOs of US listed produce businesses saw material re-ratings within the first 12 months: Mission Produce rose from 11.1x to \\~15x in 4 months from Oct20 to Feb21 and Lamb Weston listed at 7.5x rising to \\~15x in five months.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll that said, I took a large initial position yesterday: **5000 shares and 50 May22 $15C**.

Link below. \n\nI don't know if I should combine both discussions but I believe I found both interesting and significant data that supports the pre-squeeze set up of $ROOT. So this is in addition to what I stated in my previous post below. \n\nI am analyzing the following: Shares Outstanding, Public Float, Institutional Ownership, % short, and Failure-To Deliver.\n\n$ROOT has approximately 114M shares outstanding that includes all shares (Marketwatch). Out of 114M shares outstanding, they have about $75M shares as public float or around 66%. Per Marketwatch and HighShortInterest, $ROOT is currently #4 in % shares short at 35% or based on the public float, roughly 26M shares. \n\nThe second piece of data in the analysis is current institutional ownership per Fintel's 13 D\/G filings and this does not include retail or non-reporting institutional ownership. **This data shows a whopping 181M shares filed and held by institutions and 208% ownership. Could some of these shares have been sold? Perhaps but still this figure doesn't take into account all the retail ownership and non-reporting institutional ownership which could mean the overall % ownership is much higher.** \n\nPer Fintel, $ROOT had a SIGNIFICANT amount of Failure to Delivers in June, July, and August (look at the chart) which is parallel to the increase in short interest. I do not have the data for September, but it is most likely continuous to the prior months. \n\nIn closing, with such a high institutional ownership % (not including non-reporting and retail ownership), I am surprised to see that $ROOT has a 35% short interest or roughly 26M shares held short. I believe based on the Failure-To-Deliver data, these are naked shorts in which there aren't shares to borrow due to high institutional ownership. I find that this set up is very similar to $GME. Please let me know your thoughts and I'll be happy to explore more and discuss.

It\u2019s the reason why we apes are infamous, it\u2019s the reason why short-sellers cower in fear when they hear our names, it\u2019s the reason why we are Wall Street Bets. \n\nWell, what if I told you, there was a new kid on the block. Just like the younger version of our poster boy, he\u2019s shy but a quiet achiever. All the Wall Street cucks underestimate him, ridicule him for his beta stature, arrogantly assume he will never amount to anything. They haven\u2019t seen nothing yet.\n\nLet me introduce you to GME\u2019s son, Scorpio Tankers.\n\nUnlike many Gamestop wannabes, Scorpio Tankers inherits fundamental traits of operating leverage and strong tailwinds reminiscent of those exhibited during his father\u2019s youth. Basically, this young man has been dealt the best hand on the river and is all in. \n\nSo bear with me a second as I go into the finer details.\n\nAs a leading shipping company, Scorpio has the young muscle of 131 vessels with an average age of 5.5 years. These naval elites are equipped with scrubbers and require little to no maintenance meaning Scorpio doesn\u2019t have to pay for the expensive low-sulfur fuel and make large capital purchases. Why does that matter? Well, it wouldn't mean much if vessel supply satisfied demand, but as fate has it, Scorpio is positioned in the largest supply shock ever witnessed in the industry. \n\nThere are few reasons why oil exporters will be paying hand over fist for Scorpio\u2019s services:\n\n1. Inventory Shortage: Nations across the globe are experiencing shortages of oil due to heightened demand from lockdown easing and increased consumption. \n2. Dislocation of Refineries: Various refineries which require crude oil to produce gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel has closed down indefinitely during covid leaving only those in the middle east operating. As most consumer nations are across the Atlantic, it serves to reason that seaborne imports of refined products will be needed to satisfy their domestic consumption. Not to mention increased seaborne imports of crude oil caused by refinery runs in consumer countries.\n3. Arbitrage opportunities: East-West Diesel Spreads have continued to widen leading to more physical arbitrage for diesel, and therefore an increased demand for seaborne transportation. \n4. The Almighty Supply Shock: Recent IMO 2020 regulations have forced vessels to use scrubbers or low-sulfur fuel oil. Both of these are expensive as f\\*\\*k and older vessels are just not worth using anymore. So long story short, most of the older vessels are getting scrapped and there ain\u2019t nobody to take their place. Supply growth is sub 1% for the next two years and that means we get the motherload. \n\nSo how much are we looking at?\n\nAt best we make 1 billion in FCF per year for at least three years covering all debt and leaving space for distribution. At worst we end up receiving fair value.\n\nOkay, but what is the upside?\n\nThat\u2019s the kicker.\n\nSee Scorpio also possesses the explosive genes of buybacks and the notorious gamma squeeze. \n\nWith 1 billion in FCF, first comes the paydown of debt, then comes the buyback, which brings the rally in the underlying price. Add options into the picture, and well you know the rest. \n\nAt a 1 billion market cap and 1 billion in net debt, all we need is two years, and we\u2019ve made our money back and the sky's the limit. It is as simple as that.\n\nFood for thought. \n\nScorpio\u2019s reign is upon us. Let us apes unite!\n\nS.S.S\n\nP.S. 250 mil in buybacks already initiated and 3-5 Bil NAV","30":"A Bears Guide to Shorting Stupid Meme Stocks Lately, we've had a lot of P&D type stock activity, with a fast run up, and then a total bleed out. Su\\*\\*\\*rt dot com was one of these, as were any number of garbage SPACs. Kodak was one of the original best examples of this. These are usually pumped by suspicious accounts, with lots of award giving to get them to the top, and then unceremoniously dump later if they do pump. What they all have in common is very small float, and this is a very tradeable weakness for a bear.\n\nMy view is that spotting that something will pump is pretty tricky. Even if gamma is set up right, and the float is tiny usually on some sort of absurd mega short squeeze thesis, it may just not happen. However, it's VERY easy to spot something once it has pumped on a thin float. From there, you'll see the usual pumpers out there declaring it will go another 300% or whatever. But the best trade on these is to figure out when the float will increase, and confirm that the new float constitutes motivated sellers. If you can confirm when, and have a good theory for why people will sell from insane prices, you have a rock solid position to buy puts on (and can choose ITM or OTM depending on the particulars, but always with some buffer on timing). You usually have hours or days to position after this knowledge has become public, as was the case with IRNT earlier this week (That is still in progress, by the way...). Kodak gave you a full 3 weeks to play it. The scammy \"clean\" \"alternative currency\" company also gave you two days. It's a consistent source of bear wealth.\n\nSo how do you spot this?

You could argue that the merger itself was sell the news (And it was), but once they declared what date the merger would happen, bears had a full two days to sell the shit out of the stock. Sure it dropped, but no where like it did after the merger completed and the float shot up 10x or something!\n2. For Kodak, note holders declared they converted their interest-earning bonds into stock. Gee, why would they do that when they can do it whenever? to sell of course. And sell they did - over a 3 week period, relentlessly. People said the IV on those puts was too high. It wasn't. It was a bargain.\n3. For IRNT, they just filed their s-1. Everyone knows once the S-1 gets an EFFECT statement from the SEC, the PIPE shares, and I think the warrants too, become unlocked. That's an average of 8 days. So positioning a few weeks out on this one is also a win in plain sight, since a 10x or more increase in the float will cause a ton of selling.\n\nI'm sure there will be more gifts like this. There's a committed group of people that think every stock is like GME, and want to BELIEVE that just once they will catch it. They predictably get scammed into running it up, and will hold the bag too long, and all the while keep posting updates on short interest, and talking about how much they'll screw the hedge funds, and all that other garbage. Betting against their faith is a losing proposition. They can go a while and as they say, ain\u2019t selling. However, betting that a huge increase in float will wipe out the stock price is just smart, because some of those new longs WILL be selling. And that's the play you can make over and over as a bear right now.\n\nLastly, some bear theory for everyone. Normally, stocks are bought and sold on value. But Meme stocks are not. They are bought and sold on level of net hype, divided in a sense by float. A lot of meme traders show up with intent to buy - they don't care the price - they just put in however many bucks they are going to put in. Traders can try to trade these stocks by measuring hype changes and thinking about buy rumor\/sell news, etc. That can work, but is quite difficult. I'd always rather have a sure thing. And if you know a stock is going to get some number of dollars in daily that stabilize it at a price, you can make a pretty informed bet that it's going to be a ton lower if the float is a lot bigger just on this model of how the stock is priced. Why? because those new longs aren't needing to buy, they have been able to do that all along! But they might want to sell with shares that just became unlocked...\n\nYes, I am short IRNT.

Look at some of the names of stars attached to the new movie. If Nintendo can pull off anything approaching what Marvel did they're going to be wildly profitable. Almost everyone in the world knows who Mario, Luigi, Link\/Zelda, Donkey Kong, Pokemon, Metroid, and Kirby( among many others) are and have probably bought some form of merchandise connected to them whether it be home consoles, handhelds, trading cards or toys.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/qpnv557j7dp71.png?width=425&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f109b2c13d13273cba79f27bf77e038d66c4d6b\n\nNintendo has generally been a great stock to hold long term:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/doi6mwrl7dp71.png?width=766&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c4ac69faff918c960ede8db79c814be41aca772\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/zt9ew9rm7dp71.png?width=763&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc0a4863a2d22f0916eba24d4106079e682f9525\n\nBut now with the mainstream media coverage theyll get from new projects coming up it will increase interest in their products and hopefully value of IPs.

Well there were no company\/industry catalysts. The only event that seemed to occur in the prior week was the expiration of monthly options. One of the theories going around is that there\u2019s an almost quarterly cycle going on at this point where FTD\u2019s are leading to a surge in prices in the next cycle for \u2018meme stocks\u2019 which tend to be heavily shorted for the most part. How accurate this is I have no clue and whether this applies to GOEV I don\u2019t know, haven\u2019t investigated that particular theory but there\u2019s plenty of posts\/comments floating around for you to look into if you\u2019re so inclined. \n\nThe quick point I\u2019m trying to make here is that if a heavily shorted stock is popping 30% in a day, with no major catalyst for the industry or the company in question \u2013 and that company is now advancing towards realizing its major milestones with favorable tailwinds expected for the sector, it could pop a lot more than 30% in the months to come. **GOEV is among the youngest EV companies - having been around for less than 5 years, with arguably the most unique vehicles coming out (on schedule \u2013 seems to be pretty amazing in the EV space) that very few, if any, of the established or other up and coming competitors are producing, and has been shorted more it seems \u2013 for the failure of its peers than any real fault of its own.**\n\n**Part 2 \u2013 Market Trends and Upcoming Catalysts**\n\n* From an investment into equities point of view \u2013 S&P 500 has fallen about 0.5%, on average, during the month of September. Stocks have tended to go up, on average, during every other month \u2014 other than a slight dip in February \u2014 over the past half century [link]( https:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2021\/09\/01\/investing\/stock-market-september\/index.html).

[link](https:\/\/www.investing.com\/news\/economy\/monster-reallocations-to-stocks-as-us-tax-threat-recedes--bofa-2619022) \n\n* Let\u2019s take a look at the EV market dynamics and upcoming catalysts before getting into GOEV specifically, so we get a high-level understanding of the bigger picture. The global EV market is expected to be valued at $725.1 Billion by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 27.19% from $171.26 in 2021 [source](https:\/\/www.mordorintelligence.com\/industry-reports\/electric-vehicle-market). This is expected to grow to $1.007 trillion by 2027 which is an average of 2 sources - [source 1](https:\/\/www.marketwatch.com\/press-release\/electric-vehicle-market-analysis-size-regional-outlook-competitive-strategies-and-forecasts-to-2027-2021-07-12?tesla=y), [source 2](https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/electric-vehicle-market-size-to-be-valued-at-1-212-1-billion-by-2027-owing-to-rising-number-of-government-initiatives-globally-to-promote-manufacturing--adoption-of-evs--million-insights-301238118.html), another source actually has the market valued at $2.5 trillion but it\u2019s a bit of an outlier compared to the other 2 [source 3](https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/news-release\/2021\/05\/11\/2227050\/0\/en\/Electric-Vehicle-EV-Market-Worth-2-495-4-Billion-by-2027-Growing-at-a-CAGR-of-33-6-From-2020-Exclusive-Report-by-Meticulous-Research.html).   \n\n* Global EV forecast is for a compound annual growth rate of 29 per cent achieved over the next ten years: Total EV sales growing from 2.5 million in 2020 to 11.2 million in 2025, then reaching 31.1 million by 2030. EVs would secure approximately 32 per cent of the total market share for new car sales.  Despite the pressure exerted on the market by the COVID-19 pandemic, the long-term outlook for EVs is strong. The significant shift in expected volume of BEVs and PHEVs by 2030 is based on four factors: consumer sentiment, policy and regulation, OEM strategy and the role of corporate companies. All four of these factors saw major changes in direction over the last year, prior to the emergence of COVID-19, and have since been shaped further by the pandemic. [link](https:\/\/www2.deloitte.com\/us\/en\/insights\/focus\/future-of-mobility\/electric-vehicle-trends-2030.html) \n\n* In November 2018, an article came out stating that the number of EVs on U.S. roads was projected to reach 18.7 million in 2030, up from 1 million at the end of 2018. This is about 7 percent of the 259 million vehicles (cars and light trucks) expected to be on U.S. roads in 2030. Annual sales of EVs will exceed 3.5 million vehicles in 2030, reaching more than 20 percent of annual vehicle sales in 2030. About 9.6 million charge ports will be required to support 18.7 million EVs in 2030. This represents a significant investment in EV charging infrastructure. [link]( https:\/\/www.eei.org\/resourcesandmedia\/newsroom\/Pages\/Press%20Releases\/EEI%20Celebrates%201%20Million%20Electric%20Vehicles%20on%20U-S-%20Roads.aspx). \n\n* As it turns out, that number of annual EV sales of 3.5 million vehicles in 2030 was revised to almost double of that in a November 2020 report, just 2 years after the previous article. The US electric vehicles market is now expected to reach 6.9 million unit sales by 2025, up 5x from 1.4 million unit sales forecast for 2020, due to government incentives driving EV ownership. Over 90% of states offered incentives for setting up EV charging infrastructure, with meaningful quality of life incentives and exemptions are offered across 39 states in the US, including easier payment plans for the purchase of EVs, limited-time incentives to accelerate EV adoption\/conversion and lack of requirements for emission inspections across several states.

This bill adds $4,500 to the current $7,500 tax credit available for a total of $12,500 potentially available to EV buyers. It includes passenger vehicles and light-duty trucks. The proposal calls for $160 billion to fund subsidies and purchase incentives, EV charging infrastructure funding, EV manufacturing incentives, federal EV procurement requirements, and incentives to electrify heavy-duty commercial fleets. [link](https:\/\/www.cnet.com\/roadshow\/news\/ev-tax-credit-bill-biden\/) \n\n* The proposed EV credits in the budget blueprint would last for 10 years and consumers would be allowed to deduct the value of the credit from the sales price at the time of purchase. In 2027, the $7,500 credit would only apply to U.S.-made vehicles. It would also create a new smaller credit for used EVs of up to $2,500. There are also lower credits for EVs with smaller battery packs. The bill says individual taxpayers must have an adjusted gross income of no more than $400,000 to get the new EV tax credit. It would limit the EV credit to cars priced at no more than $55,000, while trucks could be priced up to $74,000. In August, the Senate in a non-binding amendment narrowly voted in favor of prohibiting taxpayers from claiming EV tax credits if they make more than $100,000 annually or if vehicles cost more than $40,000. [link](https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2021\/09\/11\/us-democrats-propose-dramatic-expansion-of-ev-tax-credits-that-favors-big-three.html) \n\n* Furthermore, the bipartisan infrastructure plan, titled the American Jobs Plan, includes billions of dollars for other electrification efforts and for a national charging network. Specifically, the bipartisan plan includes $7.5 billion for a network of EV charging stations across the country. It also includes another $7.5 billion for electric buses and other transportation methods. [link](https:\/\/www.cnet.com\/roadshow\/news\/biden-infrastructure-ev-subsidies-charging-network\/)  \n\n* States area also providing EV incentives to residents e.g. Gov. JB Pritzker signed Illinois\u2019 clean energy law which includes a $4,000 rebate for residents to buy an electric vehicle (EV). [link](https:\/\/www.mystateline.com\/news\/local-news\/illinois-wants-to-give-you-4000-to-buy-an-electric-vehicle\/). \n\n* By 2030, there\u2019s expected to be an 8% divergence between EV demand estimates and production plans, meaning there needs to be a massive scaling up of infrastructure\/capacity of EV manufacturers over current projections in order to fill the gap in the market. [link](https:\/\/gyazo.com\/66173e4431b4c6b30ac7ed0662f13f1c) \n\n**Part 2 \u2013 Company Overview and Unique Value Proposition**\n\n**Before we look into what\u2019s happened since my last post, let\u2019s go over a quick refresher on what the company does.** Canoo is a Los Angeles-based company that has developed breakthrough electric vehicles, with over 650 employees [link](https:\/\/investors.canoo.com\/news-presentations\/press-releases\/detail\/65\/canoo-receives-initial-aa-esg-leader-rating-from-msci) from leading technology and automotive companies [link](https:\/\/www.canoo.com\/about\/). Canoo\u2019s Chairman Tony Aquila mentioned that the company was focused on a product lineup that fits in the gaps of everybody else\u2019s lineup\u2026 take the turning radius of a Prius, the size of a Ford Ranger, Payload of F-150 and sell it as one vehicle [link](https:\/\/youtu.be\/RzjX9GRDu6A?t=1747). What makes this Canoo so special compared to other EVs is their modular platform, which is purpose-built to deliver maximum vehicle interior space and adaptable to support a wide range of vehicle applications for consumers and businesses. \n\nIt is this modular platform that led to Apple\u2019s interest and having talks with Canoo (the talks are assumed to have fallen apart because Canoo was looking for an investor while Apple was looking to for an acquisition), as the platform is different from ones developed by other startups and larger automakers because it integrates more of the car\u2019s electronics, allowing for greater flexibility in cabin design. It also features steer-by-wire technology, which also increases design flexibility and is not yet widely adopted in the industry. [link](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2021\/1\/12\/22225026\/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-electric-car-goev).\n\nApple wasn\u2019t the only major company interested in Canoo, Hyundai Motor Group (Hyundai and Kia\u2019s parent company) actually went a lot farther than Apple did with Canoo, announcing a partnership in February 2020 to develop new electric vehicles based on the technological platform developed by Canoo [link](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/2\/11\/21133461\/hyundai-canoo-electric-cars-partership-kia). This was extremely unusual and referred to as a significant victory for Canoo, as \u2018pretty much every electric vehicle startup has talked about wanting to license out their technology or partner with legacy automakers, almost none have landed a deal\u2026 Canoo now joins that small list despite only coming into existence at the end of 2017, when its founders started the company\u2019 [link](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/2\/11\/21133461\/hyundai-canoo-electric-cars-partership-kia). \n\nUltimately this partnership did not go ahead because Canoo\u2019s chairman didn\u2019t feel as though it was worth it for Canoo, saying that the original deal with Hyundai didn\u2019t factor in the value of Canoo\u2019s IP, so a shift in strategy was made from licensing out the technology to protecting the IP and manufacturing and selling Canoo\u2019s own vehicles to commercial operators [link](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2021\/3\/29\/22357318\/canoo-hyundai-deal-dead-electric-vehicles-goev) \n\nRegarding the technology\/IP - Canoo has developed the world\u2019s flattest skateboard platform, which enables class-leading passenger and cargo volume on a small vehicle footprint. For example, the lifestyle vehicle, which will offer the interior space of a large SUV, but on the exterior footprint of a compact car. To help achieve this, Canoo\u2019s suspension utilizes a double wishbone with two fiberglass leaf springs, mounted transversely in the front and rear of the platform. The dampers are mounted to the frame, eliminating the need for large shock towers that take up vital cabin space. The entire suspension system is incorporated into the skateboard and sits below the height of the tires. [link](https:\/\/www.press.canoo.com\/press-release\/canoo-shows-off-performance-and-versatility-of-skateboard-platform-for-the-first-time-in-video).\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the current automotive model and see how Canoo\u2019s approach and the use of the skateboard platform add so much more value than conventional ICE manufacturers [link](https:\/\/gyazo.com\/041f5f426804ab087740da6c5b0b1aeb), currently the model is broken because 70-80% of the portion of vehicle lifetime profit is only generated after the first owner. The current model is geared towards the first owner and nothing more, with an assortment of OEMs\/spare parts retailers\/3rd party installers servicing vehicles after the initial sale. Canoo aims to change this by targeting multiple owners after the first purchase i.e. owners 2-4, offering customers the ability to upgrade the model of whichever vehicle they have or switch them entirely as the platform on which the vehicles are built is the same [link](https:\/\/gyazo.com\/272959d52f3e8c169c711e9b18dbd98c). \n\nThe use, and subsequent re-use of the skateboard platform enables significant cost savings and risk reductions [link](https:\/\/gyazo.com\/7ade9dac03f0e6fcbffc6b8f3942eb4c), with the platform providing a strong business advantage as it is consistent across Canoo\u2019s vehicle lineup. If a project is started for a new vehicle which will have the skateboard platform as its foundation, they will be able to carryover engineer and labor, ~half, from one project to the next. It\u2019s also worth pointing out that in traditional ICE, it would be exceptional if Bill of Materials cost carryover across variants reached 25%, with Canoo, this is exceeding 50%. The specific savings include:\n\n* 45% - 55% labor savings for new variants developed\n\n* 57% of the BOM cost carryover across variants\n\n* >70% of critical functions are delivered by the platform.\n\nThese enable the development of space efficient cabins that integrate simply onto platform [link](https:\/\/gyazo.com\/0a5777ed4387d9d9916a0c0d949f452e), and provide the key basis for engineering Canoo\u2019s new value proposition of having a harmonized and articulated 3 \u2013 layer vehicle concept that keeps fresh and returns capital over an entire vehicle lifecycle [link](https:\/\/gyazo.com\/7992fbead2e3c724ec002333b8c909c8). This image also showcases how Canoo aims to capture the full vehicle lifecycle value [link](https:\/\/gyazo.com\/ca0abdaece1006dbb34ad42b60bb2977) \n\nThe three vehicles that Canoo has publicly announced as part of its lineup are:\n\nLifestyle vehicle [link](https:\/\/www.canoo.com\/canoo\/) - Fully electric, highly versatile and offering more utility inside and out for city explorers, businesses, families and adventurers. The multi-purpose platform unlocks SUV-size interior space on a smaller exterior footprint.

Chairman Tony Aquila said Canoo was not prepared to announce the pricing at that time, but Canoo would not be beaten in this category \u2013 you can check it out at the following link [link](https:\/\/youtu.be\/RzjX9GRDu6A?t=10908)  \n\n* Targeted HP \u2013 500+\n\n* Payload Capacity \u2013 1800 lbs\n\n* Range \u2013 200+ mi\n\n* Powertrain \u2013 AWD or RWD\n\nThere\u2019s actually a fourth vehicle as well that hasn\u2019t been listed anywhere officially but was found by \/u\/Mcardiel007 when he was having issues communicating with Canoo and went to their Torrance location and spotted them unloading what is potentially the new sedan. All credits to him\/her for the following pictures [pic 1](https:\/\/gyazo.com\/5e84005c8399352f2de9efbedeb3d933), [pic 2](https:\/\/gyazo.com\/608a14d42df52284544bfbf0cf4a2912?token=1800737b805fc34222e29805d032b29c), [pic 3](https:\/\/gyazo.com\/906b46f350bed3e4ed10357422bf548a), [pic 4](https:\/\/gyazo.com\/5dd4b620f07fcb72fdb2234dfc35a36a), [pic 5](https:\/\/gyazo.com\/83e23a1219e08bd6a2d118138121a714). \n\nWe can see that Canoo is targeting the most attractive segments at a lower incremental cost. The most profitable and highest carbon dioxide emitting segments are pickups and SUVs, with $115B+ accounting for 90% of 2020 profit pool in US, and ~60% of the transportation emissions (Canoo is targeting these segments with its Lifestyle Vehicle and Pickup). One of the fastest growing segments is delivery vans, with ~2M more delivery vehicles needed globally by 2030 [link](https:\/\/gyazo.com\/309703e692c4a4fa96cd91096b593ac4). It\u2019s important to keep in mind existing fleet conversion to EV as well. Using the common platform provides a pivot-ability to focus on high margin products and is a large and profitable opportunity \u2013 highly lucrative and accretive to overall margin [link](https:\/\/gyazo.com\/51a7448bc7b0c236d6c4b528eb662dda). \n\nCanoo is also looking at car data and not just strictly being a vehicle manufacturer \u2013 with an opportunity for harmonizing hardware and software + superior cleaning leading to actionable data instead of the status quo of outsourced hardware + poor cleaning leading to disjointed data. Each connected vehicle offers 1 \u2013 2 TB of raw data per day, with car data monetization globally valued at $250 Billion - $400 Billion [link](https:\/\/gyazo.com\/d1e6a55ce2f1bb3777020592281afe8f).\n\nTo sum it up \u2013 Canoo is well-positioned for success with a differentiated business model [link](https:\/\/gyazo.com\/6b0ce0f9af42b090b04e970aafe696fe), developing exceptional products that are aimed at the most profitable segments ($115B+ for 90% 2020 profit pool) in the US, addressing upfitting and accessories market in the US by monetizing full vehicle lifetime value with emphasis on 2nd, 3rd and 4th customers (valued at $24B+), and monetization of car data globally through customer-centric, software ecosystem generating exponential network effect ($250B+).\n\n**Part 4 \u2013 Recent Updates**\n\n**Now let\u2019s take a look at some of the hires that the company\u2019s been making (note that almost all of these hires have happened since the last quarter, with most being in the last two months, and this is not an exhaustive list).

The facility will be built on a 400-acre site at the MidAmerica Industrial Park complex in Pryor, Oklahoma. It will house a paint shop, body shop, and general assembly plant. Oklahoma is providing an incentive package that totals over $300 million, and may kick in millions more based on whether Canoo hits or exceeds a target of hiring military veterans to make up 10 percent of the workforce at the facility [link](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2021\/6\/17\/22538811\/canoo-ev-factory-oklahoma-electric-vehicles-vdl-nedcar).\n\nPartnering with VDL Nedcar as a contract manufacturing partner to manufacture the Lifestyle Vehicle for the US & EU markets while it builds its US-based mega micro-factory. By parallel pathing contract and owned manufacturing Canoo will meet its commitment to start production and deliver vehicles in Q4, 2022. Canoo Chairman Tony Aquila mentioned that VDL Nedcar \u2018is the top trusted European manufacturer building high quality products for leading OEMs, and they significantly outcompeted the other contenders. VDL is also independently owned by the van der Leegte family of entrepreneurs - which aligns with our commitment to support businesses that form the backbone of communities. This strategic partnership will enable us to deliver vehicles to market while we build our Phase 2 factory in Oklahoma. It also strongly positions us for geographic expansion in Europe and builds a lasting relationship with VDL Groep of companies. Our investment will help us scale quickly and fulfill our mission to bring affordable, purpose-built EVs to Everyone.\u201d The Nedcar facility is slated to build up to 1000 units for both the US and European markets in 2022 with a target of 15,000 units in 2023 [link]( https:\/\/www.press.canoo.com\/press-release\/canoo-names-vdl-nedcar-as-contract-manufacturing-partner)\n\nDe-risking the path to market, Canoo designed, built and tested beta for its lifestyle vehicle [link](https:\/\/gyazo.com\/e9e9bee044f83da1536c1ab57809dece), with highlights including:\n\n* >$250M invested in Beta\n\n* ~1.5M hours of engineering\n\n* ~500k miles of testing\n\n* 13 beta runners \/ 32 beta properties tested\n\n* US NCAP 5-star overall rating targeted, with simulated, sled and vehicle level crash testing.\n\nUndertaking the Gamma Phase with SOP on track for Q4 2022 [link]( https:\/\/gyazo.com\/772813dd1ab4b30255dfdfa9674006ce), with key highlights including:\n\n* >12 months of testing\n\n* ~120-150 vehicles will be built and validated\n\n* ~70 crash tests\n\n* 30 sled tests\n\n* Full slate of vehicle tests; no shortcuts\n\n* 80% of all components are sourced\n\n* 63% of all engineering is released\n\n* 54% of tooling is committed\n\nPartnering with the frontdoor collective for 10,000 MPDVs, the frontdoor collective are a network of delivery service partners that provide dependable last-mile delivery experience, with founders and executives with experience from FedEx, Walmart, XPO, Amazon, Instacart and the U.S. military.

Lafferty - $19 [link](https:\/\/www.investing.com\/news\/rf-lafferty-stick-to-their-buy-rating-for-canoo-2568124) \n\n* H.C. Wainright - $15 [link](https:\/\/www.marketbeat.com\/instant-alerts\/nyse-goev-a-buy-or-sell-right-now-2021-09\/) \n\n* Bank of America - $5 (can\u2019t find the article at the moment but I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve seen it somewhere)\n\nAverage = $13, current SP = $6.7\n\nAs of Canoo\u2019s second quarter 10Q, the company had cash on hand of $563.6 million [link](https:\/\/investors.canoo.com\/financial-information\/balance-sheet), which according to the company is more than sufficient to cover the cost of bringing its first products to markets [link](https:\/\/youtu.be\/RzjX9GRDu6A?t=9398). \n\nThe company could raise $273M from warrants if the SP is greater than $18 for 20 out of 30 days.\n\nAt a pre-revenue stage there\u2019s not too much to say in this department, other than to note that value of a couple of orders:\n\n* Over 9,500 non-binding preorders \u2013 which if they are followed through with would be worth at least $313,500,00 (assuming 9,500 orders of the cheapest vehicle which is the base model MPDV).\n\n* 10,000 MPDVs for the frontdoor collective which would be worth at least $330,000,000 (assuming cheapest MPDV).\n\nAs far as valuations go, let\u2019s divide the pre-revenue EV manufacturers into tiers for an easier look \u2013 based on their market cap. I\u2019m sure some are missing because I only took a few, let me know and I\u2019ll add them in later. These market caps were taken within a few moments of each other on 9\/21 from yahoo finance.\n\n* Lucid Motors \u2013 $41.23B, 11,000 pre-orders, delivery delayed to fall 2021\n\n* Nikola Corporation - $4.25B, lowered delivery guidance of 25\/50 vehicles for 2021 \n\n* Fisker Inc - $3.917B, >17,000 pre-orders, value of $637,483,000 \n\n* Faraday Future - $3.66B, 300 FF 91 Vehicles, value of $54,000,000 delivery in 2022 \n\n* Canoo \u2013 $1.63B, 19,500 pre-orders (9,500 individual + 10,000 front door collective), value of $643,500,000, delivery fall 2022 for LV, 2023 for MPDV \n\n* Company A (market cap too low, has a DOJ investigation ongoing and issued a going concern for whether it would have cash to make it to production) - $1.2B\n\nJust looking at a couple of examples here it would seem that Canoo is undervalued purely on a pre-orders\/revenue perspective. Fisker and Faraday Future, which are both expected to deliver in 2022 as is the case with Canoo, have over double the market cap despite Canoo having similar preorder value (compared to Fisker) or much higher (compared to Faraday Future). Haven\u2019t done a cash flow analysis of every company but even taking into consideration Fisker having $400M more in cash on hand [source](https:\/\/sec.report\/Document\/0001193125-21-242552\/), there\u2019s a significant discrepancy. Faraday Future meanwhile has less than half of Canoo\u2019s cash on hand at $230M [link](https:\/\/sec.report\/Document\/0001193125-21-242552\/).  \n\n**Part 6 \u2013 Bear Case**\n\nWith anything pre-revenue, the biggest issue is always going to be do we have enough cash to get the product off the ground imo. I could write a really long paragraph but yea that\u2019s pretty much it in a sentence. Since I\u2019m on the bullish side for the company, I\u2019ll lay out a few reasons why I think Canoo won\u2019t be running out of $$$ before it comes to market \u2013 these have mostly been stated here and there throughout this document but I\u2019ll summarize them below:\n\n* As of Canoo\u2019s second quarter 10Q, the company had cash on hand of $563.6 million which according to the company is more than sufficient to cover the cost of bringing the Lifestyle Vehicle to market. \n\n* Oklahoma is providing an incentive package that totals over $300 million, and may kick in millions more based on whether Canoo hits or exceeds a target of hiring military veterans to make up 10 percent of the workforce at the facility.\n\n* EV funding is a significant portion of the upcoming budget, this is less grounded than the others but there is assumedly some hopium that Canoo would be able to receive some federal support if needed.\n\n* The company could take on debt to assist in getting to production \u2013 H.C. Wainwright in their coverage indicated that they expect $500M to $525M in funding could be raised in debt to 2023. Tony has previously stated that they are looking for as non-dilutive an approach as possible, and given the current SP it wouldn\u2019t make much sense to go the additional equity route.\n\n* In May, the SEC opened a fact-finding inquiry into Canoo as it did with many former EV SPACs, unlike others such as NKLA and (Company A) \u2013 nothing further has come as of yet, nor have any DOJ investigations been launched.\n\n**Part 7 \u2013 SI and Squeeze Potential**\n\nI know y\u2019all have just been waiting for this so I\u2019ll get right down to it. Famously developed by the esteemed \/u\/pennyether, the SMELL system is going to help us take a look at some key numbers that\u2019ll help understand GOEV\u2019s squeezability.\n\n* Short Interest \u2013 31.8 million shares, 32% of free float \n\n* Market Cap \u2013 $1.63 Billion, not big enough that it\u2019s immovable, not small enough that shorts would be able to cover without investing a decent amount of capital\n\n* Extremely Memeable \u2013 I mean\u2026 GOEV, like Go\u2026 EV, idk I think it ticks off the memeability criteria\n\n* Low Liquidity \u2013 Average volume per yahoo finance is 2.7M shares, which is 2.7% of the free float so any inflow will cause the share price to move pretty significantly. Over the last quarter, it seems that institutions have been loading up on Canoo for cheap, with institutional inflows of $177M and only $2.56M sold [link](https:\/\/www.marketbeat.com\/stocks\/NYSE\/GOEV\/institutional-ownership\/)\n\n* Low Risk (IV) \u2013 Yep, current IV is 77.1% for 9\/24 and 10\/1 options. Please do NOT consider this financial advice, like at all, but if you\u2019re one of the folks who look to just buy options for the sake of contributing to a gamma squeeze, take a look at the post by \/u\/ChemaKyle on how buying far OTM options and how it\u2019s not the best idea if you want the MMs to hedge. There\u2019s not much of a need to hedge vs something that doesn\u2019t have a ramp up and no OI at the ATM values. I\u2019d agree with his\/her post and the commentators that buying ATM options and the underlying shares would have a greater chance at causing a gamma squeeze, but this is something you should research and do your own DD on as well based on your risk tolerance and investment threshold.\n\n**Part 8 \u2013 TL;DR**\n\nThe global EV market is expected to be valued at $725.1 Billion by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 27.19% from $171.26 in 2021, with total EV sales growing from 2.5 million in 2020 to 11.2 million in 2025, then reaching 31.1 million by 2030. EVs would secure approximately 32 per cent of the total market share for new car sales.  The US electric vehicles market is now expected to reach 6.9 million unit sales by 2025, up 5x from 1.4 million unit sales forecast for 2020, due to government incentives driving EV ownership. \n\nPresident Biden is seeking a pledge from auto manufacturers that would see EVs make up 40% - 50% of new U.S. vehicle sales by 2030, to support this EV tax credits jump to $12,500 in the proposed $3.5 trillion budget blueprint Democrats passed a couple of weeks ago. In August, the Senate in a non-binding amendment narrowly voted in favor of prohibiting taxpayers from claiming EV tax credits if they make more than $100,000 annually or if vehicles cost more than $40,000. Either way, this is huge for Canoo which is offering base models of the Lifestyle Vehicle and MPDV at <$35,000, with the base pickup model expected to be priced similarly. \n\nCanoo aims to disrupt the current automotive model by taking a piece of the 70-80% of the portion of vehicle lifetime profit which is generated after the first owner and traditionally ignored by manufacturers. Canoo aims to change this by targeting multiple owners after the first purchase i.e. owners 2-4, offering customers the ability to upgrade the model of whichever vehicle they have or switch them entirely as the platform on which the vehicles are built is the same. Canoo is targeting the most attractive segments at a lower incremental cost. The most profitable and highest carbon dioxide emitting segments are pickups and SUVs, with $115B+ accounting for 90% of 2020 profit pool in US, and ~60% of the transportation emissions (Canoo is targeting these segments with its Lifestyle Vehicle and Pickup) and targeting one of the fastest growing segments of delivery vans, for which ~2M more delivery vehicles will be needed globally by 2030, with its MPDV.\n\nTo facilitate this disruption, Canoo has developed the world\u2019s flattest skateboard platform, which enables class-leading passenger and cargo volume on a small vehicle footprint. Canoo\u2019s Chairman Tony Aquila mentioned that the company was focused on a product lineup that fits in the gaps of everybody else\u2019s lineup\u2026 take the turning radius of a Prius, the size of a Ford Ranger, Payload of F-150 and sell it as one vehicle. The use, and subsequent re-use of the skateboard platform enables significant cost savings and risk reductions, with the platform providing a strong business advantage as it is consistent across Canoo\u2019s vehicle lineup. If a project is started for a new vehicle which will have the skateboard platform as its foundation, they will be able to carryover engineer and labor, ~half, from one project to the next.\n\n* 45% - 55% labor savings for new variants developed\n\n* 57% of the BOM cost carryover across variants (compared to ~25% on ICE)\n\n* >70% of critical functions are delivered by the platform.\n\nIf we take a look at the funding incentives being proposed for consumers e.g. with the LV, the maximum federal rebate would be $12,500, and if we add in state incentives e.g. Illinois with it\u2019s $4,000 rebate \u2013 that turns into $16,500. The LV is priced at $34,750 which means that post-rebates you\u2019re getting it at almost half the price, pretty ridiculous in comparison to ICE vehicles, add in tighter emissions standards for ICE vehicles and Canoo starts looking pretty good.\n\nIf you made it this far, I\u2019d like to thank you for reading this \u2013 I\u2019d like to give a big shoutout to the community over on the canoo subreddit (not sure if I can link other subs so won\u2019t). They\u2019re extremely dedicated individuals who provide a wealth of knowledge on the ongoings of the company \u2013 from driving to HQ and coincidentally finding an unrevealed product to attending EXPOs and other showcase events and sharing vehicle images and detailed write-ups. Y\u2019all the real MVPs. Position \u2013 1k shares @ 11.69.","33":"Daily Popular Tickers Thread for September 22, 2021 - SDC | LCID | GME \nYour daily hype and or containment thread.

Crowds were going wild for $NOK in January and the mania lasted for three days before Robinhood halted the trading. $NOK boss fight was about to start after $GME, $AMC, $BB, had shown the way. In one day the share price peaked from $4.73 to $9.79. Buyers refused to listen bears explaining that the 5.6 billion share count was too high to move $NOK. Instead they kept buying hitting 1.2 billion volume in a day before trading was halted.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Global leader in 5G networks**\n\nTo keep it short Nokia is currently a network company. Main competitors being Huawei, Ericsson and Samsung. You can still buy Nokia branded mobile phones and other products under their licensing agreements, but the core is in the networks (fixed and wireless). Heart of the R&D is an iconic Bell Labs. Key words to current Nokia are 5G, edge cloud, AI, IoT etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Share count vs Market cap**\n\nNokia share count is 5.6 billion and market cap $31 billion (9\/17\/2021). During the meme action people figured out that the market cap 26.4 billion in January is what really counts, and this proofed to be right. It really doesn't matter if there are 5.6 billion shares at the price of $4.73 or 1.12 B shares with the price of $23.65 - exactly the same market cap.\n\nAs a comparison this year $GME and $AMC market caps peaked $37.3 B and $36.9 B respectively. However, $NOK didn't have a huge short position for leverage but instead it was and still is a value play with EUR 3.7 billion net cash and solid profitable cashflow. It is an undervalued quality stock in the blink of a turnaround. To give some perspective Nokia market cap was in January 2021 one tenth of Cisco's.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Renewed product portfolio is second to none in the industry**\n\nLet's face it, Nokia had problems with 5G product portfolio development after it acquired Alcatel Lucent in 2016. Company simply didn't have enough resources to focus on 5G product line while they were busy to merge ALU and Nokia 4G product portfolios. So, they ended up taking a shortcut by using programmable FPGA chips in their products instead of more efficient and cost friendly SoC chips.\n\nEventually Nokia focused to SoCs in 2019 and it took two years to catch the competition with new Reefshark based products using SoCs. In July 2021 the huge workload was pretty much done and at the end of this year over 70% of shipped products will be based on SoC's and the new deals will be more or less all part of the renewed product portfolio.\n\nNow that Nokia has catched up the gap to the competitors in product competitiveness it is adding even more firepower to the R&D efforts which can be seen as a good sign. Main target is to be the best network company in the industry and according to the management we will see some new exciting product launches still in this year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Main competitor still banned by US government**\n\nUS has been accusing Huawei about close connections to Chinese communist party and sees it as a possible security threat. Therefore, it has been warning other countries to avoid using its products and about a year ago even banned Huawei to buy much needed 5G chips. Naturally the company bought as many chips to stock as it could but it\u2019s now running out of parts (much worse situation compared to January 2021).\n\nTheir mobile handset business is currently sinking (no new 5G phones at all), and it seems that for base stations it must start using less sophisticated and more energy consuming components manufactured by Chinese suppliers. So, they will be able to deliver products but at what cost?\n\nThere have been articles stating that Chinese government should compensate energy costs to operators in order to make the new products more appealing. Pretty much the same strategical approach which Huawei has been successfully using in the past decade stealing market share from Nokia and Ericsson by selling products even under the price of components. All this has been possible because Chinese government has been subsidizing the company generously. Sad side effect has been that even there are a handful network providers left in the industry it has been hard to make any profit. Now it seems that US ban is changing the game and market share is flooding to western rivals which can start raising their prices and margins to reasonable levels.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOverall the global situation is much different than it was a couple of years ago. It\u2019s too risky for operators to focus purely on buying less secure underpriced Chinese products as their own government or consumers might turn against them. For operators it\u2019s more important to do business with reliable and ethical partners. Nokia is a good choice as it has been named by Ethisphere as one of the 2021 world's most ethical companies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Competent management with can do attitude**\n\nPekka Lundmark is the current CEO following Stephen Elop and Rajeev Suri. He did a much-needed strategy review in the company about a year ago and since then the progress has been convincing. Nokia buried its end to end strategy, business unit heads are now fully responsible of profit & loss and the decision making is not anymore scattered around the organization. All businesses are seeing growth and the change is already visible in the financial numbers even the three-year strategy execution is only in its first phase.\n\nPekka has also totally changed the company's comms policy. Nowadays Nokia is very transparent with its comms. It prefer to set lower targets and give surprise profit raises instead of promising the moon from the sky in the first place. The new policy might seem pessimistic to some but to be honest the overpromising strategy didn\u2019t work well either and shareholders along with analysts lost the faith to the company. We might argue that the current undervaluation is indirect consequence of bad comms and it simply takes a few solid quarters to convince otherwise.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**COVID and future technologies supporting 5G \u00edmplementation**\n\nCOVID boosted the network usage globally and we are seeing growing demand for better networks with higher capacity and lower latencies. However, behind the scenes there is much more happening. Companies and research labs are inventing killer apps and products to best use 5G networks. For example, VR and AR could potentially be something to wait for.\n\nBig problems with VR\/AR have been the storage, power consumption, and processing power. 5G will solve the problems by pushing these  away from the PC and into the edge cloud. Imagine the next Facebook where people will get a totally new sense of immersion with VR\/AR. When this happen the consumers and companies will be begging for growing 5G availability with more bandwidth and lower latency capabilities.\n\nPrivate wireless use cases and smart city solutions are key parts to lead the next technological revolution with significant productivity gains and will grow the demand for high quality networks. Lufthansa, many ports and mining companies are already taking advantage of early wins to beat the competition.\n\nOh boy, oh boy when the first significant use cases for masses pop up. The demand for high speed networks will skyrocket and I bet that the few relevant network companies will not sell their products and services cheap now that Chinese are not anymore disrupting the markets.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What analysts are saying?**\n\nAnalysts focusing on the company are much more optimistic than the market currently. End of July Goldman Sachs raised their target to 6.10 EUR.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nClosing price (September 17): **$5.50** (4.70 EUR)\n\nTarget price: High $8.27, Median **$7.12**, Low $5.75\n\nBuy: **17**, Overweight: **3**, Hold: **9**, Sell: **0**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Peculiar trading activity this week**\n\nNokia stock has been arrogantly used to rinse option players every now and then by market players. It seems that max pain levels for option players have been reached time and again. Actually, this happened past weeks as well when the share price was pushed from $6.29 (peak after Nokia raised their guidance for 2021) to $5.50 without any negative news. Someone adjusted the robots well as the closing price on Friday was precisely $5.50 (maximum gains for bankers). Only medicine to stop this kind of activity would be to grow the faithful owner base so it would be more difficult for market player to move the share price. Eventhough in the longrun these kind of short-term movements are meaningless.\n\nWith these levels, next week will be a great buying opportunity for long-term investors who see the underlying potential in this hidden gem. Not even meme phenomenon is needed to reach the double digits in $NOK share price in the coming years.\n\nDisclaimer. I\u2019m long-term Nokia owner with solid position of shares (9\/17\/2021 -> up +10%, YTD +49,13 %). I see the stock as a great value play in a long run but I\u2019m not a financial advisor so buy with your own risk.","37":"[GME & AMC ] A SIMPLE EXPLANATION WHY THEY TOOK AWAY THE BUY BUTTON. If your brokerage firm took away the buy button. That's because they do not actually hold the stock in question. All they hold is capital as a representation of the stock in question. So when you look at your dash and see x amount of shares. What you are looking at are synthetics. They are proxy space holders.. they are backed by the capital of your brokerage but your brokerage does not have said stocks neither do you. Even if your brokerage was to have stocks it would be in their name not yours. So if you get a warning about volatility of a stock and they are restricting trading. It's because they do not have access to purchase such stock all they have is capital to represent the stock. And if the volatility fluctuates too high they know they would not be able to cover you when you want to cash out.. so to save them selves from defaulting. t\nThey just do not let you buy said commodity....","38":"How $SPY puts made me find the woman of my dreams. A love story of loss porn & love porn. I still can't believe this guys, but I've finally found the perfect woman. She bet everything on $Clov calls and lost it all and was thrown out of her mother's apartment. I met her at our gambling addiction rehab group that my wife makes me go to. When I told her I lost all of my wife's & mine money on SPY puts, she fell in love with me and let me touch her boobs on the first day. First time we made love she asked me to tell her what other stocks I've lost money on, I told her I bought gme at the top and I could feel how tightly she squeezed me, goddamn it was really a wonderful feeling. Love is the greatest feeling in the world, it truly is. I haven't even told her about $pltr yet, I hope it never recovers now. Can't wait to see what's next for the two of us. Life is beautiful & I'm so happy to be alive. If you ever find love, consider yourself blessed and try to savour it. I've already bought short-term risky call options that I hope never make me a single cent. What a great time to be alive.","39":"SDC - Dehedging the (tiny) float Are we done?\n\nNo, of course not.\n\nDidn't have time earlier, but wanted to explain how shorts are actively attacking your options positions and in doing so leave themselves open to future regulations.\n\n**Post summary (tldr)**\n\n\\- **Dehedge backfire:** Shorts attempting to knock price below strikes are hurting themselves when the MM(s) hedge.\n\n\\- **500% larger short interest than trading float:** Short interest at 49mil should be understood next to the 97mil float of which 86mil shares are owned by institutions. This means that short interest is at a 5 to 1 scale larger than daily trading float (less institutional filings).\n\n\\- **CTB spike predicts FTD regulation:** CTB is increasing significantly, by multiples now and the result of which is likely FTD regulation.\n\n**Short strategies**\n\nWe're seeing the same pattern after hours currently that we saw the last couple days.\n\nShort playbook\n\n1. Destroy momentum by shorting any perceived breakout (there were net 1.2mil shares shorted today).\n2. Market sell huge orders to encourage strike breaking and selling to also achieve this.\n\nBut... Didn't work so well. When price moves beyond the strike threshold, the MM(s) generally choose to hedge their risk. This is well known, but I took some crayons to draw the picture to make it easily understandable.\n\n[Crayons](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/v2fao3x355o71.png?width=3219&format=png&auto=webp&s=98447970ab5457d1f0ede10d79d3e2433eaf40bf)\n\nHowever, when the reverse happens and price breaks out - all those shorts become underwater. This is happening after hours right now. I'm curious what will end up happening here. Short's goals are to knock it down below $6.5 by market extended close at 8:00pm set to render calls useless. From the looks right now, seems like it's not working.\n\n**Constrained float**\n\nThis is why I'm extremely bullish. Stupidly bullish.\n\nTurns out institutions own so much of the float that the actual daily trading float is only 1\/5th the size of the amounts of shorts. That's right. **There are 500% more shorts than typically available shares to trade**.\n\n[Bloomberg](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ck4kijx555o71.png?width=1509&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f40592f07ad91ef0d443411775a8ba135b09f33)\n\n**Total float: 96,000,000** (Bloomberg)\n\n**Institution shares: 86,000,000** (Bloomberg)\n\n**Actively traded float: 10,000,000**\n\nRead that again. There are 10,000,000 (10mil) shares generally traded unless net institutions offload negatively against an equilibrium.\n\n**Shorts: 49,000,000** (Ortex)\n\nYou read that right.\n\nThere are 49mil shares compared to an actively traded float of 10mil. Literally 5 to 1. 500%. This is insane. So what will happen to price? Nobody knows - but here are the price levels. Price moves quite quickly between stops since high frequency alto's run this all.\n\n[More crayons](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/hftm51m755o71.jpg?width=2732&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f877a0800068d845c31bed37258c33e7fc5ce2b0)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Future FTDs? CTB is spiking.**\n\nAlmost assuredly. CTB is spiking - this means there is extreme demand for shorts and limited supply. FTDs are when shorts are lent to sell short but aren't actually available in the Dealer's inventory to deal out. When this happens enough, securities are placed on the [FTD regulation list](http:\/\/www.nasdaqtrader.com\/trader.aspx?id=RegSHO) which means significantly more restrictions and forced closeouts - highly bullish to price.\n\nHere's the chart of CTB.\n\n[CTB spike](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/mkxzrfq855o71.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d71c3b9894accd2aa6819d4bfcabef1f286432c)\n\nThis is beginning to move from linear to exponential and implies severe pressure on dealers to keep up with demand. In my opinion, it's a short amount of time before this happens.\n\nIn tandem with the reg SHO list comes our favorite short squeezes (GME, AMC, IRNT, SPIR, etc etc etc). Except this company has 80% institutional holdings and no lockups expiring... Think you can see where I'm heading here.\n\n**Positions**\n\nAlready submitted my positions [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/ppf22c\/sdc_80k_yolo_45million_short_shares_aint_no_joke\/) and have additionally bought 8,000 more shares at $6.72.\n\nCheers folks","40":"Posts on IRNT Hedging Are Wrong: From the Person Who Predicted Gamestop **TLDR: MM's don't have to buy millions of shares at close. It's closer to 500-300k. Options are hedged over their lifetime retards and not just with shares. But YOLO $60c or $25P if you want a good bet**\n\nOff the bat, I'm not trading IRNT. However there are posts like [this](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/ppzol3\/irnt_the_final_stand\/), [this](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/ppurkl\/irnt_what_happens_when_more_calls_are_exercised\/), and [this](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/ppnz36\/breaking_the_market_with_irnt_the_2nd_saga\/) gaining traction clogging up my feed and they're so fucking wrong it'd be criminal if it wasn't ignorance. Modeling delta hedging and gamma squeezes happens to be my thing, I invented the model for it which notably predicted something you may have heard of. ([here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/kvjbuk\/gamestop_melvin_capital_put_positions\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3))\n\nI'm not here to make friends but to save a few people some dollars because the info they're working with is ~~flawed~~ outright wrong. Generally there's this idea MM's have to buy millions and millions of shares today after close.\n\n>If the stock closes above $45, MM\u2019s will be forced to buy 5 MILLION additional shares. They will fight us and spread FUD because they know that they are fucked\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>If every one of them is exercised, market makers will need to buy roughly 9 million shares to fulfil their obligations\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>if we buy and hold shares to go above 45$ by Friday, we can trigger an **infinite squeeze**.\n\nThis is just fundamentally wrong and misunderstands how market making of options is performed.\n\n**Market makers don't just buy a million shares on the expiration date**. That would be insane and frankly, people smarter than either of us are on the other side. Some moron with a piece of chalk came up with the equation called Black Scholes. It describes American options pricing well enough so we'll use that one. MM's usually use a mix of binomial tree and Monte Carlo models but you can read up on those later.\n\nDelta \u0394 is the rate of change with respect to price. In the BS model that is \u0394 = \u2202C = \u03a6(d1). Now that doesn't mean anything but think about \u0394 as the %  chance an option expires itm (implied moneyness). This is also the directional risk for a MM who wrote the contract. **MM's have to hedge all their directional risk** for a few reasons not limited to 1. going bankrupt 2. taking positions against clients. They make their money from scalping the B\/A and IV crush. (Options are priced that if \u0394 neutral, the MM makes money if IV decreases and loses if it increases)\n\nHere's the first important thing. The directional risk \u0394 of a contract is hedged over its lifespan. Not just all at once. So all those contracts people are talking about, most of them are already hedged.\n\nSecond, MM's hold both sides of the trade on the books, i.e puts and calls. These positions balance out in a directional sense so you need to look at the net \u0394, not just outright call buying. MM's can buy back the call contract on expiration with the put premium and take a much smaller loss than you'd think.\n\nThird, options can be hedged with other options because of this exact scenario. Then the net remaining directional risk can be hedged while trading fewer shares. Options aren't all written with underlying shares. Think about spreads. \"You created\" two contracts, sold one bought the other, and created two contracts on one lot of shares someone else owns. Same idea applies here.\n\n**So with that said we can take a look at the options chain.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/snbj0jmwn2o71.png?width=1108&format=png&auto=webp&s=5198d95029bf0dd792fc5ae17e75eca96d2b1092\n\nThis is a good view on how the chain is moving shares around. The spot when I modeled this was \\~$41. The bars correspond to the amount of shares being bought for contracts of each strike when the spot moves through a $1 range of the spot on either side. The abnormal things here are the changes around $30, $45, and $60. That's not super helpful but those are the strikes the underlying is going to be pushed towards one way or the other. It's not going to stay around $40.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever I did do the math of call deliverables for today and importantly I did it correctly. If we assume that \"magical\" closing price of $45, then we hedge all the contracts $45 and under 100%. Everything else is zero. Then we look at the difference between how the contracts are hedged now to get the max shares needed to deliver on every contract.  This comes out to 2.34M shares MAX. Even worse, maybe 30% of those will be exercised. Probably closer to 15% which is 351000 shares settled. A bunch will be cash settled (bought back), atm contracts may not get exercised if it's a net loss, and if the owner is extra special they may totally forget to exercise.\n\nThere's the problem with the posts above. There's a critical misunderstanding of how market making works and its going to lose people money. Thats all folks.\n\nIf you so desire, I'd trade around the above significant strikes. 55c betting on 60 or a short play for $25p","41":"Breaking the market with $IRNT... The 2nd Saga IRNT is primed to blow, this is just the beginning. There are still lots of obligations to purchase shares out in the market. Let\u2019s run through the numbers.\n\n# The Story\n\nRight now, there is a ton of calls loaded up for IRNT. A call is a contract saying you will buy 100 shares at a certain price (strike price), the person who sold you the call, must sell you 100 shares at the strike price of the contract. There are approximately 90,000 call options that expire this friday. If every one of them is exercised, market makers will need to buy roughly 9 million shares to fulfil their obligations. Now of course not every call is going to be exercised. [According to the CBOE about 10% of all options are exercised](https:\/\/www.moneyshow.com\/articles\/optionsidea-43293\/). Historically 60%-65% of options expire ITM. This results in about 15% of In The Money options getting exercised. If IRNT expires at 45$ on Friday then that\u2019ll be 8,427,600 shares that could be exercised. Since historically only 15% of calls are actually exercised, we take 15% of 8,427,600 and we get a dumbfounding 1,264,140 shares market makers will need to purchase to cover their calls! Currently there\u2019s 1,226,524 shares in the market (The available number of shares is known as the float). Market makers will have to procure more shares than what\u2019s available causing an Infinite Squeeze. Ideally, the more call options that are exercised and the more shares that are bought the more market makers will have to scramble to find shares. (So if you got options expiring this Friday, if you exercise them market makers will be forced to buy more shares). Today IRNT  blew past 45$ and peaked at 47$, if we buy and hold shares to go above 45$ by Friday, we can trigger an **infinite squeeze**.\n\n# The Short Interest\n\nYeah, I know. I know you are all sick and tired of hearing about sHoRtSqUeEzEs and all that garbage. I know everyone has seen way too fucking many of these posts, but hang on, because this is worth looking at. Right now, IRNT has a float of around 1.2 million shares. According to Ortex, the float was well over 5 million on the 13th. To get the % of the stocks shorted we get 5mil\/1.2m for a casual 416% short interest. That\u2019s like what, triple the size of GameStop? when GME was being shorted to all hell before poppin 400$\/share... Not to mention this short interest was reported on the 13th... before IRNT doubled in price... breaking 40$... Not to mention borrowing IRNT shares requires a 544% annual fee. Yeah\u2026\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/o96i50cezxn71.png?width=1030&format=png&auto=webp&s=f243e675a59c33f6b2a3a1e6c10b1d8d5ac2b809\n\nIt appears that market makers, like Citadel, are borrowing shares to cover their calls in order to buy some time. Market makers can\u2019t buy off the open market since there\u2019s not enough shares to go around. Since they gave their borrowed shares to the people that exercised their calls, they are now hoping that IRNT will become cheaper. Unfortunately for them, every month they wait, they get charged 45.33%  (544% annual borrow fee \/ 12). If IRNT manages to go above 45$ for tomorrow and then people hold up shares then this shit is going nuclear. There are just too many obligations to purchase shares out in the open market. This bomb is triple the size of GME and is primed to blow. Buy up shares, exercise options, i\u2019m loaded to the tits and ready to lactate and fully ejaculate.\n\n# Reversal\n\nHonestly the only way this can go tits up is if nobody gave a damn and everyone sold... which i guess very much could happen. I don't know why you would sell or stop caring for something this big. It's literally free money. Buy the stock, price goes up, hold it a bit, and then boom the stock will blow up and it'll blow you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Position\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[RH Yolo](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/4svqvl9e2yn71.png?width=757&format=png&auto=webp&s=77c1396f342b393546f2e41e804c28b8c190979d)\n\n[TDA Yolo](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/dijup7jf2yn71.png?width=1428&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1589aa9c644f9673d4cf3808342dd04f2c41dbf)","42":"What makes it a meme stock? I think that the general consensus is that GME, AMC, and BB are confirmed to be meme stocks, GME of course being the gold standard. However, after a few months we started to see SNDL, WISH, PLTR, and CLOV - among others - fall under the same umbrella.\n\nThere's obviously pump and dumps, shills, and the like running rampant now and hundreds of stocks have run through this sub where sentiment here has driven the volume of the stock - but what makes something specially designated as a meme stock?\n\nNot really sure where to start with the answer, but thought this would be the best place to ask.","43":"Cautionary note on de-SPAC squeezes All these de-SPAC squeezes are a zero sum game and will only last until warrants get redeemed or exercised. Warrants add a lot more shares at a low price. If the share price being elevated is already bound by warrant exercise\/redemption timing, it'll be extremely sensitive to any capital raise efforts by the company. That means the companies won't be able to raise much capital to benefit permanently from the squeeze. So the price will probably go all the way back down to pre-squeeze levels.\n\nMoreover, most of these companies were overvalued to begin with. That's why they were trading under NAV. They have smaller floats than expected but that doesn't mean they're undervalued like the original squeeze plays were last year. We already know shorts can delay covering for months via FTDs. Don't diamond hand thinking you'll be able to sell at a higher floor months later like GME, AMC, etc.\n\nAnother problem is that if squeeze buyers keep pursuing new plays in a zero sum set of plays, their capital will spread thin and become less powerful. The upside illiquidity pressure needed to spark a squeeze requires focused conviction buying. Therefore, future squeezes will be less dramatic or not happen at all.\n\nThis is not meant to shit on any play you aped into, just a note of caution in an ocean of confirmation bias. I have no position in any de-SPAC squeeze plays.","44":"Daily Popular Tickers Thread for September 16, 2021 - IRNT | GME | TMC \nYour daily hype and or containment thread.

If one tenth of GME hype hits the uranium stocks and some bleeds over to the spot market, it will result in a complete *meltdown* for U stock shorters aka the general commodity shorters. In my opinion, with supply constraints and increased demand (partly aided by shorts), there could be not only 10 to 1 returns and 20 to 1 returns, but 40 to 1 in some names.\n\nPast performance is never indicative of future returns, however, the previous uranium bull market demonstrates *solely the low supply\u2019s effect* on prices.

Author claims no responsibility for the accuracy of the facts and statements in this report. The investment (\"YOLO\") below is a large but recoverable percent of my portfolio, in-line with my personal risk tolerance. Not intended as investment advice. I may modify (add, reduce, or even close out) my position at any time.*\n\n**TL\/DR:** AAWW is critically undervalued. COVID has all but annihilated international air travel volumes, driving up the price of air freight. Short term shipping disruptions have caused prices to soar, spilling over in to the air freight market. Analysts are expecting this disruption to resolve quickly, but are missing the shifts that airlines are making to narrow body jets and the impact on air freight. AAWW will have high earnings for years, and its current P\/E of 4 is a joke. 13.6% of the float is shorted, and Atlas Air is free to reinitiate buybacks at the end of this month. AAWW's market cap could double and it still would trade at the rock bottom P\/E of 8. Bullish AF.\n\n\\------\n\n**Thesis**\n\nAtlas Air Worldwide (AAWW) is critically undervalued at an absurdly low valuation given its great near- and long-term prospects; there several upcoming catalysts for a rapid revaluation.\n\n**Background**\n\nAtlas Air is an outsourced air services company that provides charter and other air services (\"Airline Operations\") as well as leasing out their owned aircraft. Critically, the Airline Operations account for the vast majority of revenues (>95%), and AAWW has a very, very heavy focus and exposure to air freight.\n\nYou may know that commercial flights also typically carry cargo. When COVID decimated international air travel, it left a few limited carriers to ship air freight internationally. Atlas Air filled that void and is making big money doing it.\n\n**Short Term Prospects**\n\nBeyond the COVID situation mentioned above, oceanliners have been backed up dramatically causing a squeeze in ocean freight prices. Normally, air freight costs very roughly 4-5x that of an oceanliner. But with surging rates from oceanliners, [air freight has now become competitive for many companies](https:\/\/www.economist.com\/finance-and-economics\/a-perfect-storm-for-container-shipping\/21804500) and it is spilling over in to a squeeze on air freight. [Here's another article joking about car tires flying first class.](https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/air-cargo-boom-has-car-tires-flying-first-class-11630242001) So we know that Atlas Air is going to have a pretty stellar third quarter. One for their corporate history books, to be sure. But how do they fare long-term?\n\n**Long Term Prospects**\n\nAs a side note, I believe this is where the shorts are getting it very, very wrong. *I think* they are confident that while AAWW will have a great quarter, the freight rates will come back down again and AAWW will operate with only 'modest' profits like it did pre-COVID. What they are missing is a huge transformation in the airline industry from wide-body to narrow-body jets. Narrow-body jets carry far less cargo. Greenlight Capital did a fantastic job laying this out in it's July 26, 2021 investor letter (page 4, \"Air Freight\"):\n\n>While there has been some recovery in passenger aviation, airlines are emphasizing narrow-body planes, which carry less freight than wide-body planes. Compared to 2019, current air freight demand is about 10% higher and capacity is about 10% lower. The result is that cargo rates have exploded.  \nSupply will be slow to come on-line. Some passenger planes are being converted to freighters, but conversion capacity for wide-bodies is limited and the aggregate impact of this will be modest. Meanwhile, air freight companies trade at tiny multiples of what investors assume to be peak profits. The implied cost of equity is quite high, which makes it difficult to justify adding assets. As a result, air freight companies are in no rush to order new planes, and in any case, new orders would take several years to build. The result is rates and profits are likely to be higher than expected for quite some time.\n\n(Sorry, I tried to link the letter but the spam bot didn't like the URL.)\n\n**Short Interest**\n\nFor some reason I will never understand, at a P\/E of 4 with incredible foreseeable cashflows, some people have decided to short 13.6% of the outstanding shares. To be clear, this is not GameStop. But it is a high short interest in a stock with earnings prospects surging by the day as freight rates increase. It certainly doesn't hurt. But the story gets even better...\n\n**Upcoming Catalysts**\n\nOkay, so perhaps you believe me that AAWW is critically undervalued, that they're going to make some amazing Q3\/Q4 profits, and that their long term prospects are pretty fantastic too. What will drive this rapid revaluation in the coming months? The answer was subtly slipped in to the last earnings call (google \"AAWW Transcripts Q2\u00a02021 Earnings Call\"). Spencer Schwartz, the EVP and CFO answered a question and stated:\n\n>As far as the CARES Act restrictions, so the restrictions with regard to not being able to pay dividends or repurchasing shares, those expire at the end of September.\n\nI simply cannot imagine that in this time of record earnings, AAWW will not return that value to shareholders. If they were to announce a share buyback once the CARES Act restrictions lap, we could see AAWW finally get to a reasonable share price. I truly believe this could double in the short-term.\n\n**YOLO**\n\n$108k YOLO on Calls expiring in October and January.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/wzuyru804pn71.png?width=1268&format=png&auto=webp&s=82071fc0ff9d130964a81c208de196c9edc0d71f","49":"$OPAD - dark horse gamma squeeze\/short squeeze fueling up for launch gives local WSB retard a huge erection **TL;DR - stock with gamma squeeze potential and 157% short interest of float gets my dick hard.

Offerpad ($OPAD) is an iBuyer company with a current market cap of 2.636B.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/6wxq4xw4bon71.png?width=1266&format=png&auto=webp&s=3beaf0d4855963388afc86057c8f74523ca2c797\n\nAn iBuyer is basically a company that uses their technology to make quick offers to home sellers, then re-sell those homes themselves for profit. Think Redfin, Zillow, Opendoor - those are OPAD's competitors.\n\nOfferpad de-SPACed just a few weeks ago and started trading as OPAD on September 2. For some reason investors fucking hated this thing, so prior to the ticker change the SPAC had a huge percent of redemptions just like IRNT - a whopping 92% redemption rate. As a result, there are now only 3,387,913 shares in the free float until PIPE unlocks (TBD at this point). And, just like IRNT, OPAD has fallen into this retarded loophole created by the genius SEC where it somehow has options even though the current float is technically too small for listing options.\n\n[Redemption info from OPAD's super 8K filing - a legal filing our SEC overlords make each SPAC file when it completes its merger and de-SPACs](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/1vjw8d48bon71.png?width=821&format=png&auto=webp&s=75752ce6d62b95ac0731442ef2fdb5da9c49580b)\n\nAs a result of the low float the stock has been extremely volatile since it began trading as OPAD on 9\/2. It's seen 10-20% intraday swings pretty much every day since the ticker change. If you had just been trading those dips you'd actually probably be pretty fucking rich by now. OPAD even reached a high of $16 last Thursday. Just as it was starting to gamma squeeze into orbit, though, it was shorted to shit Thursday into Friday and eventually closed Friday down almost 40% from that $16 high. More on that shorting below - point is, this is super volatile and therefore also a high risk play. If that's too scary for you, though, then why the fuck are you on [r\/WSB](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/WSB\/) in the first place? Go back to [r\/investing](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/investing\/) and your 3 fund portfolio.\n\nAlso, if you're a smooth brain who obsesses over technical analysis - OPAD looks to have had a nearly perfect gap fill Monday and has since started to take off into orbit (up 29% from that low end of day Tuesday).\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/qheyfjjdbon71.png?width=1669&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b58b811614984f2013a2cdfb05a2259e7195d04\n\nClosed 9\/3 at $8.63 and gapped up to open 9\/7 at $10.09. On 9\/3 retraced back down to $8.60 for all of one minute before bouncing back up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Gamma Squeeze - Market Makers Fucked\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlright, now to the really good stuff. I know as soon as you read \"gamma squeeze\" in the title your itty bitty micropeen got hard as a thumbtack, so let me give you some porn to jack off to.\n\nJust like IRNT, OPAD's options can put market makers in the position where they would need to buy over 100% of OPAD's current float in order to hedge their risk from writing options to retards like you all on WSB - and frankly, it's not that hard for OPAD to reach the point where this would happen. As further OTM call options become in the money, market makers will have to buy more and more of these shares to sell to you if you decide to exercise the contract. This is because of the options Greeks Delta and Gamma. Now normally I know that for you retards \"options Greeks\" usually means the options your wife's Greek boyfriend tells you to buy, but for this play Delta and Gamma are super important.\n\nSince I know you dgaf about options Greeks, let me try to dumb it down for you apes with a picture:\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/2pluvjwjbon71.png?width=1747&format=png&auto=webp&s=892bf16fa9e8a9325c69b8808fbad066e460a6bb\n\nBased on the options open interest as of yesterday, if OPAD reached $16 then market makers would need to hedge 98.21% of the current float. At Wednesday's close price, only 29.72% of the float would need to be hedged - still a huge amount, but clearly this thing has room to run. And on top of that, OPAD already managed to reach $16 last Thursday before it was swatted down by short sellers.\n\nRight now, as the price increases past $16 market makers would need to buy less and less additional stock to hedge since the stock price becomes further and further from the open options interest. If more people buy more OTM options, though, then the price could run even higher because market makers would need to buy even more stock even after the price runs (aka the situation IRNT is in right now). This is delta and gamma at play, and what can create a gamma squeeze. This covering would be incredibly difficult for market makers to do because of the low number of stock available in the float. OPAD already briefly reached $16 last Thursday and OPAD's options volume and open interest has been steadily increasing, so who knows what the fuck could happen over the next few days as we head into September options expiration.\n\nAlso, since you're a degenerate and have likely already started to buy options on this shit before even finishing my DD you may have noticed that OPAD's options open interest and volume is much lower than IRNT's. For one, this is probably because you apes haven't caught wind of OPAD until right now and haven't yet started buying large amounts of retardedly OTM calls. However, even with the lower overall open interest there is still a ton of potential.\n\nHere is OPAD's total open interest and volume since I started tracking it last week:\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/3ahxfhvmbon71.png?width=524&format=png&auto=webp&s=592b7835a2304db6ab812fdccfd9fb680b477ab8\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/puvnpdmobon71.png?width=518&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e5d576a1ba05856cbe93449daa6b8c72cae3791\n\nHere's OPAD's OI and most recent volume for September expiration compared to IRNT, as of the end of the day Wednesday:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n||OPAD|IRNT|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Puts - OI|3,326|25,276|\n|Calls - OI|19,369|58,031|\n|Put-Call Ratio - OI|0.17|0.44|\n|Puts - Volume|1,605|9,719|\n|Calls - Volume|16,205|41,787|\n|Put-Call Ratio - Volume|0.10|0.23|\n\nWhile the total number of calls (for all strikes and for September) is lower than IRNT, there are pretty much no puts open for OPAD whereas IRNT has almost half as many open puts as calls. Puts that market makers sell counteract the hedging that market makers need to do when price increases in order to cover the calls they sell, so for OPAD a much lower relative number of puts means that the open calls could still require market makers to hedge a large volume of shares even if there are less total calls than IRNT. To dumb it down for you apes - less put mean slightly less call still go big boom.\n\nAnd all of this isn't even accounting for you dumbass apes who love short-dated OTM options. Just like GME, stock buying is what can really get this going. But, more options open interest means that the gamma squeeze potential will only increase.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Short Interest - Short Sellers Fucked\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/y56rygbybon71.png?width=1196&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb999d9ecbf55fe076aae8dbf20f5f8cc49a7977\n\n[I know short squeezes are like crack to you people, and I'm here to feed your addiction.](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/jck8gau0con71.png?width=460&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc05bf4a5ebb91d0c4ceba8067c56f69ad856da5)\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, ever since OPAD started to run last week it's been getting hammered by short sellers. To begin with, even taking out the gamma squeeze considerations with OPAD it's a retarded idea to short this stock right now. OPAD is a legitimate growth stock with many signs that it's significantly undervalued right now and could likely be a nice return even if you were to just buy and hold. For example, OPAD's 2021 projected revenue is $1.7-$1.85 billion. With their current market cap, they would only be trading at a 1.55 multiple; OPAD's peers are trading at multiple times higher than that. Even if all outstanding warrants are executed and after PIPE unlock, this stock will still be undervalued relative to its peers.\n\nThe crazy thing about the shorting is that according to Ortex, short sellers have now managed to accumulate a total short interest of 5.33 million - which is **157% of the current float**. Short interest **increased 36% yesterday**, cost to borrow reached as high as **220.08%**, and **utilization is at 99.98%** (aka there are pretty much no shares left to short).\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/btsivxm2con71.png?width=439&format=png&auto=webp&s=684fd041c0a8b15af0761fed6ed835d88b9a1634\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/0fvtcdr3con71.png?width=1259&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1948a30365647cadf2459096e789bbe99c1c211\n\nShort sellers would already need to purchase 1.5x the current float to fully cover their positions. However - remember what I said earlier about the market makers needing to buy stocks to cover the calls they're writing to you retards? Because the market makers are doing that, there would be even less shares for short sellers to cover with. This is how you get to infinity squeeze potential - there just wouldn't be nearly enough shares available for everyone to buy what they need to cover. This gamma squeeze\/short squeeze potential is also exactly what happened with GME back in January. It's almost like these dumbass short sellers haven't learned a damn thing.\n\nIt also seems that these short sellers caught on to this risk and really don't want this thing to blast off. And I take offense to that - I want my tendies. These huge drops in price were rally killers. If you check the open interest from Ortex above you'll see the huge increase in short interest after last Thursday.\n\n[Shorts fucking with OPAD when it started to take off last Thursday](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/mr2cfuu4con71.png?width=1666&format=png&auto=webp&s=359769d5f4676a797ecff357c00ad0f47fe90927)\n\n[Shorts fucking with OPAD again when it started to take off Wednesday](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/dpsq83p5con71.png?width=1670&format=png&auto=webp&s=79f80e9a93511d65bb9c10f457249823e70a8b07)\n\nWhat's great is that even though this has been significantly beaten down by short sellers, OPAD has come right back after each dip you see above. This thing just cannot be beaten.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/eht6wkq7con71.png?width=959&format=png&auto=webp&s=570e9c1bd82e51863c34106b5666d0e8fa91e483\n\nMore importantly, though, is that since these short sellers seem to just keep doubling down each time this thing starts to blast off they will be extra mega-fucked once it actually does achieve liftoff. Each time they double down on their shorting they are just adding more fuel to the fire. More than that, if the folks shorting OPAD are the same ones shorting other low float stocks like IRNT, and OPAD pops alongside those other stocks - we very well could see short sellers getting margin called from multiple positions turning extremely against them all at once just like we saw back in January\/February with GME, AMC, etc.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/c4s8y6k8con71.png?width=821&format=png&auto=webp&s=572dfc1c1e7a6baf03e1fe610864b755ce7b8547\n\nSo, there you have it--yet another gamma squeeze\/short squeeze stock for you to go apeshit over. Good luck, this one should be lit.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/up8fm599con71.png?width=676&format=png&auto=webp&s=92991b84268635c27e5f743f9584bb74c1c6d7d7\n\nOh, also - positions below. I didn't sell last Thursday during the run, instead I've been steadily buying more. This baby still has lots of room to run and has yet to truly pop.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/gpjcqs3acon71.png?width=1183&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8f2449319bc5ee538da2015162549ea25434b2c","50":"Daily Popular Tickers Thread for September 15, 2021 - IRNT | GME | AAPL \nYour daily hype and or containment thread.

What if I told you that the President of North American Operations for Genius Sports is one of the single most important individuals in the history of ESPN and the NFL?  Ladies and Gentleman, I present to you the man with the Midas Touch, Steven Bornstein.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**THE MASTERMIND BEHIND ESPN**\n\n* In 1980, Steve joined a 4 month old startup that some of you have probably heard of called ESPN.  Ex-Disney CEO Michael Eisner would later say of Bornstein, \"Steve brings a wealth of [experience](https:\/\/www.espn.com\/pr\/s\/010410steveb.html) in broadcast, cable and new media.

Sunday Night Football. Chris Berman. Surely you've watched it in your parents basement.\n\n>*Bornstein recalls some of those early years at ESPN: \"Frankly, we were very close to going out of business in the early 80's.  It early became quite clear that we weren't going to be able to make any financial sense out of this unless we changed the model.  As a result, ESPN really invented the whole business of affiliation fees for the cable industry.

He will also support the integration of recently acquired businesses, including Second Spectrum, which is the official data tracking and analytics provider of the EPL, NBA, and MLS.*\n* Before Steve's hire, GENI secured an exclusive rights deal with the NFL.  Presumably, the NFL thought their previous arrangement with Sportsradar (which the NFL chose not to renew) wasn't generating as much revenue from the sportsbooks as it could have been.  Since Bornstein's tenure, deals have been closed with most of the major sportsbooks and the rest should be completed in the near future.\n* Some of the sports books seem to feel fleeced by the deals, yet they've paid up.\n\n>*\"They are* [charging 4x](https:\/\/www.legalsportsreport.com\/53865\/nfl-betting-official-league-data-dispute\/) *for the same dataset.\" Said one sportsbook operator exec.*\n\n* I think a lot of it has to deal with GENI's leverage and the NFL's support of GENI but I can't help but think about Bornstein's role.\n\n>Longtime NBC Exec Don Ohlmeyer had this to say regarding Steve's business prowess, \"Steve is one of those [pivotal people](https:\/\/www.sportsbroadcastinghalloffame.org\/inductees\/steve-bornstein\/) in the history of sports television...He's a smart and tough negotiator, a tremendous leader, and one of the great innovators this business has ever seen.

I'm curious of any of ya'lls opinion on whether you think the growth of Tesla has been Musk driven or actual progress driven. I'm a turbomachinery engineer by trade, and I damn near went to work for SpaceX pretty recently actually, so I do have a sense of the engineering prowess the company has. But, we all know what a company is actually doing doesn't necessarily mean the stock price is going to respond similarly...it's mainly psychological not real; i.e., Gamestop and AMC. It's all a big meme. So hypothetically, say Musk's alien master race handlers come back and take him home, and we still have Tesla, what happens then?\n\nTSLA does have a massive head start in the EV world, and I myself own a ton of TSLA. I support Musk's goals and overall plan, and I do think he's a brilliant person, but he's also not as self-made as the fanboys say nor is he a super ethical person based on accounts of friends of mine and him. But is the image he's cultivated driving the company stock price, or are the numbers? That's the million dollar question.\n\nAlso, I'm just gonna say it, Stephen Mark Ryan the Solving the Money Problem guy acts like a complete shitbag who survives off of calling himself a genius and smelling his own farts. I don't think the man is stupid, nor is he wrong about many of things he says about Tesla, but GOD he's insufferable and so arrogant. His damn Youtube channel keeps getting pushed to me by the algorithm gods at Google and everytime I think \"...maybe this time it'll be different\", I watch a little, hear him gloat about all his money, call some people retarded, and I want to puke.

You should talk to a financial professional before making any investment decisions and should do your own research\\***\n\n**Short Interest Stats and Analysis**\n\nTo put it simply, the short interest on IRNT is absolutely insane. Combine that with the fact that it's a newly trading company (and susceptible to more volatility) and has a VERY low float, and you have a recipe for an absolute slam dunk.\n\nFirst, let's take a look at Fintel and iBorrow desk. iBorrowdesk has consistently shown the borrow fee to be over 500% and the available shares to be far below 10,000. Similarly, fintel has consistently showed less than 1,000 shares available to borrow. Though some people don't trust these sites, the similarities in the data help to add credibility\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/qubmtqnjxjn71.png?width=1270&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e966aee1e3deb1b3f19bb4edfebeb4090e3bb1a\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/yuuj6skkxjn71.png?width=968&format=png&auto=webp&s=97cbe756d2845006ddb0c35e624032935587c4a8\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/i0vhzl9lxjn71.png?width=986&format=png&auto=webp&s=082680490a232aa61f456c8a4492050d51e5baef\n\nI'd also like to turn your attention to [this post by another WSB user](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/pnff3b\/irnt_gamma_squeeze_with_213_of_float_claimed_by\/). This post analyzes how the extremely low float of this stock due to it being a new stock and the insane option OI presents the opportunity for a legitimate gamma squeeze - not some fake hype run up - a legitimate gamma squeeze similar to GME's first run up.\n\nIf you look at websites like Baron's they'll tell you that the SI as a % of the float is only 1.79% (about 700,000 shares). This is correct but doesn't tell the whole story. Because of redemptions and lockups, the actual float is 1.3m shares, which makes the real short interest on tradable shares about 56%. Interestingly, [Ihor's tweet](https:\/\/twitter.com\/ihors3\/status\/1437512870351282177?s=19) shows that the borrow fee is asininely high, which again shows the difficulty of borrowing of this stock and thus the easy possibility of a short squeeze. 56% short interest is an amazing number in and of itself, but that's not the whole story. The thing about this stock that really gets me going is the options activity. The OI on options of this stock is absolutely bananas right now. Remember when I said that there are about 1.3M tradable shares due to it being a new stock post-merger? Well, at a $20 price, almost double that amount is held in ITM calls alone. THAT is why the stock has serious gamma squeeze potential. Remember, both the GME and VW squeezes happened because ITM options OI outnumbered the float of companies that were already heavily shorted - this is the power of a gamma squeeze. Most meme stocks that have been \"squeezing\" recently have been small short squeezes due to retail traders and HFs taking advantage of social sentiment. The reason that we haven't seen a violent squeeze recently is because there hasn't been a stock with options activity like this - until IRNT.\n\nAdditionally, you probably saw that the stock went up to almost $40 last week out of nowhere. Again, this is the power of a low float stock with high ITM call OI. If this stock starts picking up, the low float and call OI could propel it to meme stock legend status.\n\nFurthermore, data from ortex has also consistently shown a SI of over 300% and a cost to borrow over 500%, which is consistent with the sources listed above. Yes, the SI is definitely a plus, but again, the real power here is the gamma squeeze potential.\n\n(The above four paragraph's were heavily borrowed from the originally linked user, so please check out his post).\n\nMany people will probably not believe some of these shorting numbers and will consider them unreliable because of how new the stock is. That's understandable. However, if you're in that camp, let me present to you this: the NYSE's regulationSHO FTD list. Per SEC regulations, stocks that reach over a certain amount of FTDs are placed on regulation SHO's threshold list. This is a very small list and identifies stocks that are grossly over-shorted (FTDs being the evidence of that). GME was on this list for a very long time before it squeezed. So if you don't believe the websites's SI numbers, then you at least have to believe the NYSE's numbers about FTDs. When a stock has too many FTDs, it means that it is extremely hard to locate shares and repay borrowers, which is a sign of over-shorting. Here is the NYSE list:\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/z5q0vbtmxjn71.png?width=2710&format=png&auto=webp&s=e76c960abd9f88936b898b3dbebbf5d82519a9cb\n\nNotice the second to last one? DING DING DING. Though being on the threshold list signifies overshorting, there is yet another thing that we can take from this - forced covering. IRNT has been on that list since 9\/2. Per regulationSHO, after 6 TRADING days on the list (9\/10), stricter location requirements for shorting are put in place. Take a look at the giant green uptick that we saw on 9\/10. 13 TRADING days on the list and forced coverings start taking place where a market-maker is subject to fines and loses his or her market making abilities if this regulation is violated. 13 TRADING days after 9\/2 is 9\/21. Remember all of those call options I talked about above, well they will be exercised on Friday 9\/17. So, let's review what we have: an extremely high reported short interest (you can believe it's 600%, 300%, 56%, whatever), an extremely low an restricted float, ITM options expiring on Friday that outnumber the total float, the stock being on the threshold list indicating over-shorting, forced coverings taking place right around when those options would have to be delivered. Again, this is exactly what we saw with GME. It's important to note however, that this is also an issue of timing - the stock is likely to have a gamma squeeze sometime late this week and through next week. After that, there's a good chance that covering could lead to the stock being taken off of the threshold list.\n\n**Fundamentals**\n\nThink that IRNT is just a squeezable meme stock with no long term potential as an investment? Wrong. The stock is not like most meme stocks - it actually is a good underlying business. According to an article by a website not allowed on here (just copy and past the quote in google to find it), \"With the company\u2019s international expansion, M&A initiatives, and cloud acceleration, under my most optimistic case scenario, the company is worth $55 per share. If IronNet continues to sign agreements with nation states and companies like CrowdStrike did, I believe that the upside potential is significant.\" The article discusses how the company's AI initiatives, cyber security focus, and cloud acceleration, all of which are some of the most important and up and coming technology sectors, poise it to go up in value significantly. Additionally, the company also just reported earnings. Though the earnings were lower than expected, take a look at the after hours activity - the shorts have no juice left.\n\n**Conclusion\/TL;DR**\n\nSo there you have it. in my opinion, IRNT is an EXTREMELY good stock fundamentally so I will be holding it long term. HOWEVER, the stock also presents a rare gamma squeeze - short squeeze opportunity that retail hasn't seen since GME. The stock has an extremely high reported short interest, an extremely small float, open interest on ITM call options that outnumbers the current float, is on the regulationSHO threshold list indicating that it has extremely high short interest and possible naked shorting, has been on that list for a significant amount of time, and the ITM options that outnumber the float are expiring right around when shorts would be forced to cover their FTDs. In other words, an absolute grand slam.\n\n**\\*Please note that none of this is financial advice and I am not a financial advisor. Investing is risky and high short interest plays are even riskier.

Ever since then the market has gone up a lot. Doesn't that make him wrong this time? Not necessarily, no. In fact, that means we might be in an even bigger bubble than we were earlier this year. Luckily for him, seems like he learned from last time to hedge his shorts too, and bought FB and GOOG calls in case the market continues to rocket, which have printed hard. \n\n Speculation is at an all-time high.

So inflows into the fund are driving up the premium to NAV.\n\nThe premium now sits at a record high 28.5%.\n\nFor perspective, during the Uranium surge that took price from the $20s to the $40s over the past month, the typical premium for the fund was in the mid single digit %s.\n\nSo 28.5% is absolutely remarkable. This is a dam about to break and drown everyone who lives on the other side. Once Sprott is able to issue shares once again, it will now be able to buy more uranium out of the market than anyone thought possible. $180-$200 is entirely possible here as a blow off top (currently at $45 a pound).\n\nHere\u2019s a [picture](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/MVQA0F8)  of previous bull markets in uranium for those that think a $200 price target is absurd. Note we just hit $45 yesterday so we are just getting the really exponential bit on this rally.\n\nAnd this is a minuscule market, so sprott\u2019s buying directly drives the price up. And because market participants know the price of uranium is effectively guaranteed to rise because of this guaranteed source of pent up demand, they are are willing to pay for the premium in the uranium fund to get a piece of the action. \n\nThis of course only drives the premium of the fund up further, allowing Sprott to issue even more shares, buy even more uranium, sending the uranium price up further, exciting more investors who will buy the fund, and the cycle repeats \n\nThis is effectively a short squeeze where the buying is being telegraphed ahead of time. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the short squeeze has begun, but buying here is the equivalent of buying GME a when it was in the $50-$100 range on the initial surge.\n\nSo who\u2019s short? There\u2019s not actually a large existing short paper position, but rather a large implicit short position by the utilities who run nuclear power plants. They MUST continue to purchase uranium to power their nuclear power plants, but this market has been so depressed for so long, that consumption is now roughly 20% higher than annual production; Creating a supply deficit where buyers must compete to cover their implicit short.  Remember, a short squeeze is when there is forced buying of a limited quantity of shares, which causes an exponential increase in the price of shares. Here we are just talking in pounds of uranium rather than shares of a stock.\n\nAt some point utilities are forced to buy more uranium, but so far they are holding off (thinking prices will drop back down).  They are using existing smaller stockpiles in the meantime, but eventually they have to buy (reactors need uranium to run).  But they will be competing with buying from investors via the Sprott fund. What happens when prices don\u2019t drop and instead continue rising?  At some point a utility buyer will panic and start to buy (covering their implicit short) and this is when price will have a blow off top as others in the market begin to panic buy as well. \n\n\n\nSo what tickers can be offered up here? \n\nNot many, because the uranium space is tiny and WSB has a $1.5 billion market cap minimum.\n\nOptions? You can, but premiums are absurd now that the squeeze has already begun.\n\n**Tickers:**\n\n$CCJ is one ticker you\u2019ve likely heard of, and it\u2019s the only one with mkt cap large enough to mention directly.   However they have massively hedged and don\u2019t really benefit all that much from the squeeze. A pretty lame play tbh\n\nSprott Uranium Trust is the vehicle I\u2019ve written about here where you can buy uranium directly (rather than miners), and directly contribute to the squeeze, but I also can\u2019t post the ticker yet due to mkt cap concerns. It\u2019s also only available in Canadian and otc markets, but Sprott is trying to get it listed on the NYSE as well for the future. You can buy it via Fidelity and a few other brokers right now though. \n\nNorthshore uranium etf has lots of miners in it but a mkt cap of $350m so no ticker\n\nWant to sell shovels rather than set out on a mining adventure yourself? Sprott the company owns the uranium trust driving this whole thing and collects fees from it. Benefiting from the inflows into the fund as well as the underlying price appreciation of uranium.  They also have direct exposure to several uranium miners they\u2019ve invested in. They also aren\u2019t big enough yet at $1 billion to post the ticker.\n\nThis uranium short squeeze, powered by the Sprott physical trust is everything the silver squeeze should and could have been back in the first quarter.  If silver squeezers had bought the Sprott physical fund, PSLV, rather than ishares SLV, silver would be far higher now. Let this be an example of what\u2019s possible in commodities when physical demand overwhelms a relatively limited supply of available metal!","59":"$IRNT - Gamma squeeze with 213% of float claimed by OI & SI I've been following $IRNT since the post market jump when it went from $16 to $40 in AH. It had seemingly been written off despite the fact that it's been primed for a gamma squeeze at almost every moment since it came down from that run to $40. To be clear, this is a real gamma squeeze, not a meme-y play. This is a rare situation and that's why I'm calling attention to it.\n\nThe setup is simple:\n\n1. The float is currently 1.3M shares due to SPAC redemptions & lockups and will be at this number until after options expiry on Sep 17th.\n2. It has options, which usually are only available for stocks over 7M float\n3. Almost 200% of those 1.3M shares are claimed by the already ITM open interest on the call options. This means that the squeeze has ALREADY been set in motion and you're just waiting for time to draw closer to expiration. The movement we saw Friday is what we refer to as a \"pre-squeeze\" movement, there is likely far more to come.\n4. On Friday the $20 strike became ITM and instantly doubled the amount of the float that is claimed by the open interest.\n5. As of this morning ORTEX shows 4.3M shares shorted which amounts to 336% SI with a cost to borrow of 628% on average. I have doubts about the accuracy of this specific data because that would put the amount of the float claimed by institutional obligations nearing 600%, ~~so I'll stick with saying that the last reliable data seemingly had SI at around 13%~~ Ihor's tweet new tweet puts SI at 56% of float with the same elevated cost to borrow.\n\nIf $IRNT runs, it could potentially be the first true infinity squeeze since VW and has the potential to beat the heights of $ORGO & $GME.\n\n$IRNT will very likely start running some time before expiration on Sep 17th. It could be today, it could be Thursday, but at some point, the buy volume will likely come in and the IV on the options will spike to crazy heights almost instantly.\n\nBe warned, this play is incredible risky, if you choose to partake only do so with money you can afford to lose.\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advise.\n\nCredit for the original DD on this goes to \/u\/Undercover_in_SF \\-- His posts are what turned me onto the low float.\n\nEDIT #1: Per Ihor's tweet, SI is at 728.46K shares, which puts current SI at 56% of float. [https:\/\/twitter.com\/ihors3\/status\/1437512870351282177?s=19](https:\/\/twitter.com\/ihors3\/status\/1437512870351282177?s=19) \\-- I have reached out to ORTEX to confirm their numbers which put SI at a significantly higher 5.11M.\n\nEDIT #2: ORTEX has confirmed that the 5.11M data is incorrect due to a mismatch with current loans and exchange reported short interest. After review, it looks like Ihor's tweet is accurately portraying current short interest and the 56% of float stands for now. Big thanks to ORTEX who are always incredibly helpful.

The $DUDE here with my periodic \"Dude Diligence\" reports on $CLOV - Clover Health Investments Corp and thoughts on potential price action for the upcoming week.  Be prepared to read a little bit (and I realize what I have here is probably more reading than most of you crayon-eaters have done collectively since the first grade)  ...but it will be worth your time if you're seriously considering trading CLOV\n\nI want to start off with a quick intro- I'm a long-time lurker here on WSB but rarely post.  I joined a little over a year and a half ago right before COVID hit as the subreddit was on the verge of breaking 1M Degenerates.  I spend a bit more of my time on Twitter and am active there if you care to follow me aka, The $DUDE  ([https:\/\/twitter.com\/nikiped1a](https:\/\/twitter.com\/nikiped1a)).\n\nAnyway, I don't want to make this too long but I've been trading for about 16 years which started with a single $2000 deposit as a college student in my early 20s which was a good chunk of my net worth at the time.  That $2K has grown significantly over the years through working, trading and has been diversified into real estate as well.  I work in tech for a publicly traded software company and now have few healthy trading accounts (primary trading, IRA and Roth IRAs) where I mainly swing\/momentum trade some YOLOs and occasionally invest longer term if I feel there's a disruptive technology\/company w\/ high upside potential.\n\nOriginally I came to WSB for the memes and then quickly realized it was a really helpful community w\/ useful crowd-sourced info, strategies and data in addition to the solid meme game.  That was before it exploded 10X in size over about a 6 month period time leading up to the GME and AMC squeeze craziness earlier this year.\n\nWhile I will say most of the info here is still good for the most part, you do have to dig a bit deeper now, verify a little more often and pushback on a lot more misinformation than in the \"early days\".  And that brings me to the point I'd like to speak about today.  Misinformation and how it has run rampant especially when it comes to Clover Health Investments Corp aka $CLOV.\n\nI've been trading this stock since late Feb and seen the many ups, then downs, then big ups again and then downs.  But more than anything, I've seen and still see the disruptive potential of A.I. in a dinosaur of an industry like Healthcare.\n\nHere's my fresh take since I know there are a lot of new traders\/investors in CLOV and there's been a definite uptick of late in interest to potentially invest moving forward... (Disclaimer:  I am not a financial advisor, this is not financial advice, it is solely made up of my own personal opinions.  I do currently hold a position in CLOV for obvious reasons once you read through this)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**STORY TIME**\n\nI'm going to start this all off with a little story...\n\nOnce upon a time, there was this new fangled company called Tesla and it was forward thinking and it was technology obsessed and it was innovation first and they wanted to build cars.\n\nWell, the collective good ol boys (GoB) club that makes up the automotive industry saw this quirky autist-lead company and laughed at them and pointed fingers at their silly electric motors with \"auto pilot\" and weird frunks and batteries- WTF??.\n\nThe GoB don't like disruption.  Instead, the GoB loooove the status quo- because they're on top and in control, so why wouldn't they?\n\nThis TSLA company didn't care that they were getting the cold shoulder and started to build their cars that were \"never going to succeed\" anyway and they were actually pretty f\\*cking bad ass.\n\n\"...There's no way this TSLA is a viable long-term company- they don't have the recharging infrastructure, there will never be adoption by the masses and ultimately they'll run out of money, \" sneered all the GoB execs along with the know-it-all stock analysts, big banks as well as Jim Cramer and all his Wall St. buddies.\n\nAnd then something weird happened ...people started buying these electric cars ...and buying them even more and buying them even faster.   We all know how this story ends.  The GoB are now scrambling to catch up and acquire similar technologies to compete w\/ the O.G. disruptor.\n\nThis is what happens with disruptive companies- they see problems and their leaders are visionary problem-solvers and refuse to follow inefficiency and the status quo.  And it's weird because when these disruptive companies pop up, you'd think they would be praised and their industries would welcome their new ways of thinking.  But that's not real life- instead they're mocked and told they'll never make it and to give up because deep down the GoB know the legacy way of thinking is in danger of drastically changing and all of the sudden the go from leader to playing catch up.   So the collusion begins and they do all they can to ensure there's a failure to launch w\/ negative publicity, or just ignored altogether, shorted to hell or option D:  all of the above.  Whatever it takes to kill off the \"perceived threat\".\n\nWell, there's another company similar to TSLA that's looking to disrupt another Dinosaur industry- Healthcare- and healthcare may be the oldest most dinosaur of the dinosaurs...  This company is $CLOV and why a lot of people in the rapidly growing community refer to it as #TeslaHealth.\n\nAnd before many of you in here sneer and mock- hear me out over the next few paragraphs.  I will support my DD w\/ data, Press Releases, Quarterly Financials, etc, not opinions...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CLOVER HEALTH IS A TECHNOLOGY COMPANY FIRST**\n\nFirst and foremost $CLOV needs to actually be seen and recognized for what it is at it's core- NOT a meme stock.  **Clover Health, at its foundation is a Technology\/Software company (Artificial Intelligence\/ Machine Learning) that just so happens to focus on the Healthcare\/Insurance space.**   It's only a meme stock because it's heavily talked about here on WSB, but this is actually a long-term growth stock with rapidly improving fundamentals, massive growth... and down the list, the potential of a squeeze, but that is secondary in my mind.  I'm long on CLOV.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CLOVER HEALTH's MISSION STATEMENT**\n\n*Clover is a healthcare technology company helping members live their healthiest lives with its Medicare Advantage plans. On a mission to improve every life, Clover uses its proprietary technology platform to collect, structure, and analyze health and behavioral data to improve medical outcomes and lower costs for patients. As a company whose business goals fully align with its members' health needs, Clover works with members and their doctors to become a valued partner. Clover has offices in Nashville, San Francisco, Jersey City, and Hong Kong.*\n\nCLOV is a next-generation healthcare\/insurance disruptor in that it has developed proprietary AI technology called the Clover Assistant (CA).\n\n**Clover Assistant Explanation Video:** [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=TX4S8oDou4k](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=TX4S8oDou4k)\n\nWhat's great about this is that it integrates with all FHIR EHR's (Electronic Health Record systems) ...hospital systems, doctor's offices, pharmacies, etc. use EHR to store and manage patient info (similar to a CRM used by all businesses) and these can now all integrate easily with CA.\n\nThis allows for real-time data visualization & reporting at doctor's fingertips so they can not only make the best possible decisions for the health of their patients based on all available info across all EHR systems, but also concurrently make the most cost-effective decision from a business standpoint (improved margins compared to competitors w\/o a similar type technology.)\n\nIn short, as doctors are empowered to make the best possible decisions, patients health is significantly improved having fewer issues long term, which leads to fewer hospital\/doctor  visits and a dramatic reduction in overall costs.  Clover Assistant has the ability to keep people healthier, longer.  How is this alone not something we should all get behind for the general good of our population??\n\n**Aug 10, 2021 PR Link:**  Now integrates with all FHIR-enabled EHR's\n\n[https:\/\/investors.cloverhealth.com\/news-releases\/news-release-details\/clover-assistant-now-supports-all-fhir-enabled-ehrs](https:\/\/investors.cloverhealth.com\/news-releases\/news-release-details\/clover-assistant-now-supports-all-fhir-enabled-ehrs)\n\n**Sept 8, 2021 PR Link:**  Clover Health partners with largest EHR company AthenaHealth for seamless integration of Clover Assistant\n\n[https:\/\/investors.cloverhealth.com\/news-releases\/news-release-details\/clover-health-integrates-clover-assistant-athenahealths-market](https:\/\/investors.cloverhealth.com\/news-releases\/news-release-details\/clover-health-integrates-clover-assistant-athenahealths-market)\n\nYou want to know what's also pretty f\\*cking awesome that doesn't get enough talk time?  They could also potentially license the Clover Assistant software to other healthcare orgs at some point, i.e. Software-as-a-Service or SaaS.  I work in this space and have been selling SaaS contracts to large corporations for the better part of 2 decades.\n\nMy previous company had a stock price of $15 when they were selling \"perpetual licenses\" aka, dinosaur software sales model.  ...when they switched over to a SaaS model, their stock price climbed to over $500 during the next 10 years.  Did I play my ESPP during this time?  Uh, you know I did!\n\nIn summary... just this software licensing component alone could have a massive effect on longer term company revenue, if played correctly.  Of note, I don't think productizing CA for resale is currently in the works from what I've seen, so none of this potential is priced in yet.  If\/when that happens, you will wish you put every single penny you have into CLOV.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TOTAL ADDRESSABLE MARKET**\n\nCLOV plays heavily in the Medicare Advantage space and potentially at some point Original Medicare as well.  Currently citizens in the US are eligible for Medicare at 65 years old and about 60M people total or 18% of the US population are on it as of 2019:\n\nTotal Medicare Growth (Original Medicare + Medicare Advantage)\n\n[Total Medicare growth in US from 1990-2019](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/xkm6dlk8o5n71.png?width=779&format=png&auto=webp&s=48ef0dd7523641c089b72e8da7d0f9f468cb889d)\n\nMedicare Advantage Growth (26M Medicare Advantage vs. approx. 36M Original Medicare enrollees)\n\n[Medicare Advantage Enrollment 2000-2021](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/dt9mpi6b65o71.png?width=778&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d2aba04aafdb94478983e2c0be05f0a95bb1f24)\n\nMedicare Advantage is gaining market share vs. Original Medicare\n\n[Medicare Advantage Penetration 2000-2021](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ty5snobk65o71.png?width=777&format=png&auto=webp&s=68e57e18123c0369310dba08c5c0b99a997c2ed2)\n\nLook at the Baby-Boomer jump beginning around 2006 and its resulting sharp increase.  It's expected to continue this rapid rise during the next decade and if the eligible age of Medicare is dropped from 65 to 60, that could add another 24+ Million (a potential 40% bump) to its total lives managed within the program.\n\nA unique component that CLOV has when it comes to lives managed is that it has a direct contracting entity (DCE) program.  This is unique Medicare program by the CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) has only offered this to Clover Health and 52 other organizations at this time.\n\nThis has been a boon for CLOV as they have nearly doubled their lives on Medicare in just over 6 months (take a look at revenue a little further below in this DD to see what just a single  quarter offering this program has done for revenue.)\n\n**Info on DCE Program:** [https:\/\/www.cloverhealthpartners.com\/en\/](https:\/\/www.cloverhealthpartners.com\/en\/)\n\n**Quick Video on Program:** [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=dlTnq7cIoKM](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=dlTnq7cIoKM)\n\n(...and someone correct me if I state this inaccurately) but my understanding of DCE (and it's by far the most exciting growth component that I've seen so far related Clover's massive upward revenue trajectory from Q1 to Q1 ) ...under direct contracting entity, Doctors are able to sign patients up individually, outside of the normal Oct 15 - Dec 7th Medicare Open Enrollment period.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EXPLOSION IN REVENUE GROWTH YEAR OVER YEAR**\n\nHere are Data from CLOV's most recent Q2 10Q filing on Aug 11, 2021:\n\n**Total Q2 2021 Revenue was $412.5M, which was a 139.7 increase YoY** compared to $172.1M in Q2 of 2020.  $216.4M of that was just from Direct Contracting- are you seeing why I'm pretty stoked on this hyper-growth company?\n\nTotal **revenues for the full 2021 year are now expected to increase from $810-$130M which was reported following Q1 earnings to $1.4- $1.5B** following Q2 earnings (and only a $2B valuation at an $8 stock price- very low for a healthcare\/technology company!)\n\nTotal Lives (customers) under Clover Health management at the end of Q2 was approx. 129,000, **an increase of 126.3% YoY GROWTH!!!**  This has mainly come from the DCE program since it has only been available to Clover since they were included in it along with 52 other companies earlier this year.\n\n**Lives under Clover Assistant management grew by 229% YoY.**\n\n**Clover expects a significant increase in total aligned beneficiaries on Jan 1, 2022**, when claims aligned beneficiaries for 2022 become active - Uh, you probably want to climb on the bandwagon sooner than later given this projection.\n\nIf this alone isn't enough to get you to jump on board blindly w\/ no questions asked, I don't know what to tell you.  If you can tell, when Q3 earnings are announced on Nov 8, 2021, CLOV could rocket if Q3 report is anything like Q2, especially with a potential update or guidance on newly enrolled lives under mgmt as a couple of weeks of Medicare Open Enrollment will have been completed prior this next ER (OE period goes from Oct 15- Dec 7).\n\n**CLOVER HEALTH's EXEC TEAM:**\n\nTake a look, you have a mix of former Google, Uber, (remember how I said it's a technology company)  United Health Group, McKesson execs... Their board\n\nExec. Summary:  [https:\/\/www.cloverhealth.com\/en\/about-us\/our-story](https:\/\/www.cloverhealth.com\/en\/about-us\/our-story)\n\n...also, check this:  [https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/en\/news-release\/2021\/04\/15\/2210944\/0\/en\/Demetrios-Kouzoukas-Former-Director-of-the-Center-for-Medicare-and-Principal-Deputy-Administrator-of-CMS-Joins-Board-of-Clover-Health.html](https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/en\/news-release\/2021\/04\/15\/2210944\/0\/en\/Demetrios-Kouzoukas-Former-Director-of-the-Center-for-Medicare-and-Principal-Deputy-Administrator-of-CMS-Joins-Board-of-Clover-Health.html)\n\nDemetrios Kouzoukas also just joined Clover Health's board in April.  He is a former Director at the Centers for Medicare- he obviously knows how the program works.  Here is a brief snippet from the PR:\n\n***\u201c...Demetrios is a significant addition to the Board. Having led the legal and regulatory affairs department of the Medicare division at UnitedHealth, he understands the opportunity and challenge of operating at scale. He has an encyclopedic knowledge of Medicare rules and regulations, combined with an incredibly astute business and strategy acumen. We are grateful that Demetrios is joining us on this very important journey....\u201d***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CLOVER RAPID EXPANSION IN COUNTIES WHERE THEIR SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE**\n\nCLOV just expanded its market from 108 counties in 10 states to 209 counties now in 9 (11?) states (101 county increase) as of June 24, 2021 press release, meaning essentially all of the earnings data I listed above were from the smaller market, so growth will only continue to accelerate rapidly.\n\nPR Link: [https:\/\/investors.cloverhealth.com\/news-releases\/news-release-details\/clover-plans-expansion-101-new-markets](https:\/\/investors.cloverhealth.com\/news-releases\/news-release-details\/clover-plans-expansion-101-new-markets)\n\nIf that wasn't exciting enough, shortly after announcing these new counties above, Clover Health then announced on Aug 3, 2021 they will be entering yet another new state- their 12th- with a new partnership w\/ ValueH.  This new state just happens to be the great state of Florida- the third most populous in the US and a huge Medicare growth potential state for obvious reasons.\n\nPR Link: [https:\/\/investors.cloverhealth.com\/news-releases\/news-release-details\/clover-health-launches-florida-partnership-valueh](https:\/\/investors.cloverhealth.com\/news-releases\/news-release-details\/clover-health-launches-florida-partnership-valueh)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**HEADWINDS, MISCONCEPTIONS & OUTRIGHT MISINFORMATION (LIES) CONTINUALLY PERPETUATED**\n\nMarket manipulation w\/ the price is probably the biggest headwind.  CLOV, along with GME and AMC have got to be the most manipulated stonk tickers in the history of the stock market.  Market makers, HF and shorts have had an uncanny ability to nearly always pin the price on Fridays just below the options Max Pain price collecting premium and allowing them to do it cycle after cycle so they're making up their borrowing fees while making significant profit on top as well.  The more of the free float investors buy up and hold, the less ability they have to short & manipulate.\n\nThe second biggest headwind in my opinion is probably the collusion between analysts, Hedgies and who know's who else (it may be tin hat conspiracy theory, but I feel the big insurance players like United Healthcare Group, Humana etc. are all somehow involved behind the scenes) is involved in colluding with these corrupt analysts to provide totally false price targets, driving price down, while holding short positions.  Help me if I'm mistaken, but aren't PT generally upgraded and downgraded following big news like earnings, PR of new developments, etc?  With CLOV, it doesn't seem to happen that way, they're just downgraded haphazardly for no apparent reason other than those holding short positions are either in trouble, or have some quick money to be made.\n\nLoot at these situations below as examples:\n\nThere are at least two instances the community has heavily documented where Bank of America (Kevin Fischbeck) initiated a large 700K short position and within days downgraded their PT from $15 to $10.  Obviously manipulating the stock price in their favor.  What's funny, it was just a month and a half earlier he issued a buy and the earlier $15 target... just doesn't make sense.\n\nThe second was a small relatively unknown analyst from Cowen Research that just so happened to downgrade CLOV right as it was building a lot of momentum during the past few weeks.  No negative news- actually if anything, CLOV has had a ton of really positive news and it follows a blowout Q2 earnings.  I really believe it was a greasy attempt to help save a lot of Hedgies from getting stuck w\/ a lot of options expiring ITM this past week when it surged 22% the day after Labor Day only to be hit w\/ hard attacks.\n\nCowen just so happened to **also initiate a significant short position right before their BS downgrade.**  Cowen has a pretty greasy track record of shady dealings and has been fined  heavily and had to address many lawsuits over the years.  Why would anyone even trust them with this terrible track record??\n\n[https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/lawsuit-cowen-fired-top-investment-banker-who-raised-concerns-about-the-banks-business-ties-to-russian-oligarch-vitaly-malkin-301090919.html](https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/lawsuit-cowen-fired-top-investment-banker-who-raised-concerns-about-the-banks-business-ties-to-russian-oligarch-vitaly-malkin-301090919.html)\n\nI've also heard people talk negatively about losses.  Well, when you're in healthcare, and we're in the midst of the worst worldwide pandemic in over a century, your Medical Care Ratios (MCR) will get out of wack temporarily and that is the case over the past couple of quarters.  MCR was at 111% during Q2, however, Q1 of 2020 (before much of the COVID expense hit) it was 89.4% according to their earnings report.\n\n[https:\/\/investors.cloverhealth.com\/static-files\/149b80af-b48f-419d-aa4b-ad5dca7801db](https:\/\/investors.cloverhealth.com\/static-files\/149b80af-b48f-419d-aa4b-ad5dca7801db)\n\nFree Cash Flow (FCF) has also been talked about and has been affected as this company is in growth mode, however, it has improved tremendously: +31% increase from Q1 to Q2 of 2021.  It will be interesting to see where it goes for Q3.  Definitely moving in the right direction toward getting into the black.\n\nAlso much of the expense costs for Q2 were one-time line items related to stock compensation and the cost of warrants to the company (warrants along added -$134.5M in debt)\n\nAs of the end of Q2, CLOV had $630M cash and cash equivalents in the bank, so they can sustain losses for awhile (years, possibly longer depending on how quickly covid-related expenses normalize) without issue or dilution.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**HOW TO TRADE CLOV**\n\nOK, this is getting kind of long, so I may type up another DD with more supplementary info, but I want to get into some of the anomalies specific to CLOV if you choose to trade\/invest in this stock.\n\nShort Attacks:  Watch out for what looks like a mass selloff right at market open almost every day, shorts always short millions of shares each morning to kill off momentum and scare paper hands and inexperienced traders.  It generally comes back after about 10:30-11am ET when the shorts return their shares because they're just looking to scalp 10-40 cents or so each day and then return them for some profit.  If we're buying up all the float, and not allowing them be be shorted, HF and short's wont be able to do this and we start to gain ground.\n\nWhich brings me to this- IF there's anything I hope you learn from reading my DD today, it's this:  **DO NOT BUY SHORT-TERM CALL OPTIONS ON THIS STOCK.  If you do, they will most likely end worthless on Friday's and you will lose your money.**\n\nI know options are normally an attractive opportunity to get into a stock inexpensively because if it moon's at some point, you make a grip on a small investment, but I've been trading this for months, and seen it happen many times over- you will lose your money.\n\nInstead, BUY ACTUAL SHARES!   Help buy up the float and HODL!!  This is going to be a volatile potentially few months as we start making progress vs. the shorts to jack them with an impending squeeze, options have not been working, nor will they, it appears, in the short term.  There may be some opportunity to buy and profit from options once momentum is in bulls favor, but that time is not now.\n\nI hope this was helpful, I know it's long, but if you made it to the end here, really consider getting into this stock, it has a lot of things going for it and it's only $8 right now.  Even without the squeeze potential that exists, this could easily be $20-30 with it's extremely rapid growth of their Direct Contracting.  If you're holding it long, then when the squeeze does happen, it's just gravy.\n\nI may have missed a few things, but if so, I'll just follow this up with another post here in the next day or two.  Would love to hear all of your feedback and\/or differing opinions on this.  Happy investing fellow autists!!!","62":"Men of the Clov Bag Watch II: a DD\/TA of the most hated ticker on the internet - CLOV So, friend, this past week you made the plunge and decided to join the **Men of the Clov Bag Watch**. We'll ol' Cbass is here to welcome you to this *definitely-not-a-cult* group of investors who are, throughout the internet, highly **R**egarded for **E**xcellence, **T**houghtfulness, **A**droitness and **R**espectably **D**istinguished **E**loquence in **D**iscourse (*occasionally* going by the acronym: **RETARDED**).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR: Hey everybody!

Technically Anal\n\nPart 2. Dynamically-expanding Dildos\n\nPart 3. A Conspiracy of Idiocy\n\nPart 4. Rise now, a Man of the Watch\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Part 1. Technically Anal**\n\nSo this past week saw a considerable breakout of the $9 resistance wall and a concomitant FOMOing into the ticker with FD's destined to Lambo or Burn. Well those FDs are either now ash or in a giant gasoline-soaked pyre, but let's have a look at the charts to see if any of the poor bastards holding 9\/17 $17 calls can be saved.\n\nFirst, a general look at the important lines:\n\n[So many lines, so much value](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/cnrsj3ehy2n71.png?width=1576&format=png&auto=webp&s=c95d5beb400d7024a6196736106457fd6c843879)\n\nThe most important level on here is the one I've labeled \"Launch #1\", though at this point the \"#1\" is looking smidgen unnecessary. First established on the gap-down on Oct. 6 of last year, it provided resistance on three occasions afterward (yellow arrows for the simpletons), with the last ending in a massive breakout to all-time highs.\n\nThe $9.08 line is the second most important line on the chart, in my possibly chromosome-deficient opinion. First established on Mar. 15 of this year after the bounce from all-time lows, it provided some level of resistance immediately afterward, but in the post *squeeze-that-wasn't-a-squeeze* world of the past few months it has become the ultimate resistance, a titanic, 700-foot wall of ice and sorrow towering over the pitiable bag holders huddling beneath its monstrously cold heights. Before this week, there were three prior attempts so surmount the Wall, all ending failure.\n\nOf next and most immediate importance is the $8 mark. I have it as $7.94 as there is a small case for its origin story beginning on Mar. 25 of this year. However, like the $9 mark, its true importance has been found recently, and ***cannot be overstated***: This line, however pitiful, represents a **higher low** and thus holding that line is of critical importance for the prospects of any near-term upward action.\n\nThe orange downtrend line was the last of the downtrend lines, and crossing it resulted in the most recent attempt at the Wall of $9.\n\nThe green line is **the bottom**, a place of green pastures and buxom women, where the burdens of your bags will vanish away . . . because you've passed from this world and its worries.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNext is a chart looking at the $11.13 mark:\n\n[Fibonacci, because Italian people](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/86tdxc76z2n71.png?width=1576&format=png&auto=webp&s=05b1f1e37ef85a53788c7100bddb17f9d64889a2)\n\nAs shown, the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level of $11.13 is shaping up to be a very important line. Indeed, it is soon to over shadow the $11.80 breakout line in that regard. On the dump following the June push, the ticker found support at $11.16 on Jun. 21, and subsequently it opened and dumped down from that level on a Jul. 6 (yellow arrows for simpletons). And just this week we saw the ticker reach up to **exactly** $11.13, before getting summarily thrown back off the top of the Wall. At this point, I think a breakout of $11.13 probably results in a significant push up. But we're getting well ahead of ourselves with that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBeing a TA wunderkind, I've turned my head to just the right angle and found a sliver of hope for the hopeless Men of the Watch:\n\n[Two girls & a cup: can't possibly fail](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ary603egz2n71.png?width=1842&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4e5b5f27b60656be73760dee5251e0e1d79e6b8)\n\nThe good news is it looks like a cup & handle formation. The bad news is that *usually* a cup & handle is a pause in an uptrend. Here, however, you have a downtrend into the cup (the giant pink arrow for the simpletons). This is a great example of Cbass's First Law of TA: You can always find a chart & indicator combination to tell you what you want to hear. So, let's just call this a positive, because we have little else.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLooking at 1hr chart, let's see if we can find some more copium:\n\n[I see Higher Lows from my house!](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/dyaiz8hnz2n71.png?width=1842&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f6ec421727eeedc62a68c18d33c86a25cd03e9d)\n\nAfter the post earnings dump, CLOV briefly had a breakdown below the $8 support before rallying back up to test the $9 Wall, repeatedly. In that time, it found itself in a new channel between $8.40 and $8.60, thus establishing $8.40 as a **new, higher low**. This, as much as the Great YOLO Brigade of Labor Day Weekend, was the cause of the breakout on Tuesday. Basically, the chart was screaming that a breakout was incoming, YOLO brigade be damned.\n\nThe copium for next week is whether or not another higher low can be put in at $8.60. Like any good Man of the Bag Watch I have to hope it can, because if I try to leave, my portfolio gets hunted down and beheaded.\n\nThe worse and therefore more likely scenario is a breakdown all the way back to $8, undoing several weeks worth of upward progress. The absolute worst case is a *true* failure of $8 and a return to all-time lows. This would be a dagger in the heart, and unless someone knows a Red Woman, we're fucked.\n\n[Winning, winning so fuckin' hard right now](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/8zf0arxvz2n71.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=55ff09023716e9894e0f4fd672ec56fa1d4808de)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Part 2. Dynamically-expanding Dildos** (^(for maximum gapping))\n\nIn true Clovtard fashion, my knowledge of this company prior to purchasing shares was \"it does some techy stuff with healthcare.\" Which, it turns out, is basically all you need to know. This company is one of those that seems complex and super high-tech, but in reality is more basic bitch than your average Instagram thot. That being said, it might still work out for them... after all, do you see some of these basic bitches that blow up on Instagram? Living proof that ***literally anything*** is possible.\n\nBut just in case someone cares (and to keep the Clovtards from reeing in the comments), here's a look at the company underlying the CLOV:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\----------------------------\n\n***Business Model***\n\n* **TL;DR: they sell insurance to old people & process payment claims from doctors**\n\nClover sell two products:\n\n1. Medicare Advantage (MA) plans, which are just insurance plans for people on Medicare that include extra services along with the Medicare stuff, and\n2. Direct Contracting (DC) plans, which are one of several alternative payment models recently put forth by CMS (the people that run Medicare)\n\nThe important difference between these is that Medicare Advantage is an insurance plan where the ***patient*** is Clover's customer and Direct Contracting is where the ***doctor*** is Clover's customer. With the latter, Clover is acting as, essentially, a *payment processor* for the doctor's Medicare patients. This allows Clover to get a sweet slice of that government largess. On the doctors' side of it, they deal with Clover instead of CMS. Supposedly the whole scheme (and this is one of five put forth by CMS in 2020) is supposed to save the government money (>!it won't!<). I don't give a fuck about that part; all I care about here is whether Clover can grow their slice of the pie.\n\nThis Direct Contracting scheme was a ***major selling point*** for Chamath when they went public (more on that below), and for good reason. Clover only needs to manage a single relationship (with the doctor) to grab up dozens, or potentially hundreds, of patients. This DC scheme should be (*on paper at least)* far more efficient than Clover's original business model, which was just managing MA plans.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\----------------------------\n\n***Growth***\n\n* **TL;DR: they can** ***potentially*** \\~**25x their customer base** (^(but probably much, much less))\n\nSo other than **\"the squeeze\"**, why would anyone ***genuinely*** believe this company is going to have some astronomical valuation that would give them a stock price on par with the likes of United Healthcare? Simple: growth.\n\nRight now Clover only services MA and DC contracts in a small number of counties: 108 in 8 states. They are expected to nearly double with an additional 101 counties by the end of the year, bringing the total to 209 in 9 states. Since there are 3,000 some odd counties in the United States, there is (*on paper*) a lot of room to expand here. **This is good**.\n\nAs of their latest earnings report, they had 128,591 \"lives under management.\" (I think that is a creepy as fuck way of putting it, but I *guess* it's industry standard....) Of those, 66,566 were MA customers and the remaining 62,025 were *indirect* patients, i.e., the Medicare patients of doctors in a DC agreement with Clover. The total of \\~129,000 was a year-over-year increase of 126.3%. **This is also good**.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Math time!**\n\nIn their best counties, Clover has upward of 25% market share (at least this is their *claim*); that is, they have a quarter of the MA patients signed up with them. But to assume they can do that everywhere would be absurd. To keep this ultra simple, let's just assume that their current percentage as of the last earnings report is representative of what they can do. So that is 128,591 \"lives\" across 108 counties which comes to an **average of 1,190 \"lives\" per county**.  (Obviously, not all counties are the same size, but let's just use this average for simplicity's sake.) So we have:\n\n**1,190 x 3000 = 3.57 million \"lives\"**\n\n**3,570,000 \/ 128,591 = 27.8**\n\nSo, ***theoretically***, Clover could achieve **27.8x growth** in customers, and ***presumably*** a similar growth in revenue. (We'll get to profitability, or lack there of, below.) Looking deeper at this number, one thing going for it is that the number of old people is steadily increasing. But on the other hand, competition is a thing, and big thing in this space. To assume that Clover is going to have 3.5 million customers in 10 years, or even 20, is pretty wild.....\n\nChamath claimed Clover was the \"easiest ten bagger\" he'd ever seen (or some shit like that). So, even going with that number, they would end up with 1.3 million \"lives\" in ten years. Even this seems pretty high to me. They went from 0 to 62,025 DC patients this year, but it is ***always easier to grow when you're small***. Scaling is an issue for all businesses.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\----------------------------\n\n***Profitability***\n\n* **TL;DR: they'll make no profit for a long ass time** (^(if ever))\n\nAs for actually making money, well Clover doesn't do that. Yes, they had a 140% increase in revenue, which is good, but their expenses are rising ***faster*** than revenue. Accordingly, they missed on earnings by -0.52, or **378% downside surprise**. In typical corporate fashion, their forward guidance is full of claims of improvement on cost management just around the corner.\n\nThere is, to be fair here, a legitimate reason for some of the cost increases in the form of covid expenses. Essentially, some old people needed extra care, while others *delayed* care until it looked safe which caused a massive spike in trips to the doctor. And when you're old and you let shit slide, it gets a lot worse and a lot more expensive.\n\nFurthermore, their basic strategy involves eating losses when they take on new \"lives under management,\" with the idea that they'll make it back, and more, further down the road with that same patient though the efficiencies of their \"A.I.\", Clover Assistant.\n\nTaking them at their word that this works (and will continue to do so at larger scales) then it is obvious they will being eating losses for years to come. Allegedly, they'll turn a profit in 2023, but I wouldn't hold my breath on that. However, just growing their \"lives under management\" number might be enough to hold up the stock price.\n\nIt might **not** be enough, however, to keep the lights on. If they can't at least slow the bleeding, share issuances could be lurking down the road (queue the pump & dump conspiracies).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\----------------------------\n\n***Competition***\n\n* **TL;DR: they have to take market share from better companies**\n\nAs noted above, the biggest hurdle in front of Clover is **competition**. Despite the \"tech start-up\" narrative surrounding Clover, the reality is that they are marching into the teeth of well-entrenched healthcare companies.\n\nThe likes of United Healthcare and Humana aren't going to take lightly to little ol' Clov rolling up in their shit. With about 10 million patients between them, UH and Humana are monsters in the Medicare space and with that comes the ability to undercut the competition. Furthermore, all these big players also have their own ***magic AI machine-learning gizmos*** that do ***magic AI things***. And they already have access to more data than Clover on account of their massive patient base.\n\nThis doesn't mean they can just snuff Clover out of existence, but taking away market share from established players is a far different gambit than expanding into a new market. And it gets harder the bigger you get.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\----------------------------\n\n***Shaddy Shit***\n\n* **TL;DR: Chamath is a shaddy af, and so is the CEO**\n\nThis whole shabang was rolled out in typical Chamath fashion. Back in October of 2020, in his pitch for Clover, he claimed they **\"already\"** had 200,000 lives under management in their **Direct Contracting program** (i.e., not including the MA patients). Except that was bullshit of the Chamath-degree. At the time he claimed this, Clover ***hadn't even started*** its DC program (it had only just been accepted into the program).\n\nAs their latest earning report notes, they don't expect to get anymore \"lives\" in their DC program until Jan. 2022. (This is due to Medicare enrollment period rules). So, rather than \"already\" having 200,000 for 2021, Clover will instead end the year with the \\~62,000 that they have right now. ***Chamath at his finest, ladies and gentlemen.***\n\nClover's top guy, Vivek, is also well-known for being shaddy. Though, in his case, I don't actually care as much. Back in the day, this guy ran three hospitals in NJ that were noteworthy for having the highest fees of any hospitals in America. Shaddy, but shaddy in the ***ruthless capitalism direction***. He gets a pass from Cbass *for this*. He is also alleged to have pilfered a company he ran back in the day. This doesn't get a pass, because it could negatively affect my bottom line.\n\nClover is the subject of two ***related*** investigations, one from DoJ and the other from the SEC. The DoJ one is about shaddy business practices; something about kickbacks. I also don't give much of a fuck about this. The SEC investigation is about the fact that the DoJ investigation was not disclosed during the SPAC merger. All this will probably amount to some fines, if anything at all.\n\nOn scale of 0 to Enron, I'll give Clover a 1.5. Doesn't look that bad to me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\----------------------------\n\n***Technology***\n\n* **TL;DR: they have a magic AI app that's designed to maximize** **~~health~~** ***profits*** (^(maybe))\n\nThe last thing to mention is the Great Green Hope: the **Clover Assistant**. This is the \"tech\" in Clover and the reason dipshits are using #TelsaHealth. What is it? Well, basically a data input and analysis program. More basically: *Microsoft Excel with fancy buttons*.\n\nClover Assistant is used by the doctors (and many MA patients use it, too) to coordinate and recommend stuff. The Great Hope here is that doctors love using this thing so much that they'll sign onto a DC agreement with Clover, allowing Clover to process their Medicare payment claims in exchange for access to the \"**app**\".\n\nSo is it going to work? Well, it is ***starting*** to: Clover went from 0 to 62,000 patients via this scheme this year. It's a country fucking mile from what Chamath claimed, but ain't nothing. And given the potential for expansion into the rest of the US, and you have the receipt for a pretty damn good return on capital. But then again, it is just an \"app\".\n\nTo be clear, I don't hate the *idea* of Clover Assistant. Conceptually, I actually like it. The Clover Assistant basically helps doctors make sure their patients are getting the \"right care\" by compiling data and presenting it in an easy to use fashion. This is presented as an opportunity to \"improve outcomes\" and \"save costs\" and \"help the under-served.\" But I don't give a rat's ass about any of that.\n\nWhich brings me to the Hindenburg report, and the part about it that I ***like***. The report claims that Clover is using the Assistant to direct doctors toward medical recommendations that would result in profits for Clover (rather than the best medical outcome), and that they are incentivizing the doctors with increased payments for these outcomes. ***I love this.*** Now, Clover vehemently denies this is the case, but I (not so) secretly hope they're lying here, because this is ***exactly*** what I imagine when I think of applying Big Data-A.I. and Machine Learning to healthcare.\n\nPeople have ***blind faith*** in machines, particularly ones that they've been told are \"**A.I. powered**\" and involve \"**machine learning**\". Thus, you can use the concept of \"A.I.\" to persuade patients to just accept whatever the computer tells them. Machine learning is then used program the Clover Assistant to ***maximize profits***, which should involve providing the minimum care required to keep the patient alive as long as possible. (Medicare pays a set amount to Clover and they get to keep the extra if the patients don't use up all the funds).\n\nThe only way I could see to improve on this diabolical scheme would be if they ground up the corpses of their newly deceased patients, turned them into food and fed them to the rest of their **\"lives under management.\"** I'm lookin' for every penny here, kids, ***every single penny***.\n\n[It's made from options traders!](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/u4qd8tzo63n71.jpg?width=780&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6e27a86ed516acbd906706d2e9440056b6bd90d3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Part 3. A Conspiracy of Idiocy**\n\nTypical of any stock ticker that gathers a cultish following, the Clovidiots are as well-known for their conspiracy theories as they are for their options expiring worthless. Now, most of these are the run-of-mill shit you get with any ticker: the Hedgies, reeee! You would think that this is the first time some of these people had ever bought a stock... oh, wait.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\----------------------------\n\n***Hedgies!!!***\n\n* **TL;DR: it's the stock market, deal with it**\n\nSo, do the \"Hedge Funds\" manipulate the stock price? Well, sure, why not. They definitely shorted it, and then managed to cover those short sales with little appreciable rise in the stock. Back in June, CLOV was at something like a 48% shorted. Now the it's 15% and I believe it got as low as 7% before this week's run up. While going from 48% to 7% short with no appreciable rise in the stock price looks impossible, it's definitely not when you considered that a large percentage of the float has been in institutional hands this whole time. Stock goes up a little, they sell and back down she goes, welcome to a regular day on the stock market.\n\nIs this some grand conspiracy of fat cats in a room smoking cigars as they plan out how to stick it to those pesky Reddit kids? ***I doubt it***, but if it makes you feel better, whatever.\n\nI, personally, would worry less about the \"Hedge Funds\" and more about the Market Makers, as they're the ones selling you the options, and if they buy up the stock beforehand, they can sell out for a profit while simultaneous vaporizing those call options you bought from them. In fact, I'm pretty sure this is the game.\n\nCan anything be done about it? Well, no, not really. At least, not unless retail buys up a larger percentage of the float. However, with each false run up, I wonder if that exact process is taking place, i.e., more bagholders are being newly minted, and each, not wanting to take an L and just move on with his life, decides to become a \"diamond handed ape.\" Only time will reveal the truth of this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\----------------------------\n\n***Us vs. the World***\n\n* **TL;DR: everyone thinks this way, deal with it**\n\nThe second great conspiracy of CLOV is that the whole of the internet is out to get it. This is proffered with the full knowledge that GME-Anon and Popcorn ***both believe the same thing about their own stock.*** Both also believe that CLOV is, ***in and of itself***, a conspiracy to distract from their pet stock. But GME-Anon ***also believes*** that Popcorn is an engineered distraction. And all three are ***also*** convinced that the Mods are out to get them, ***specifically***.\n\nThis is, of course, perfectly normal behavior. That might seem shocking to some of you, but the next time you're watching football with a die hard fan (or whatever lame-ass europoor sport you watch), look for their reactions whenever the slightest thing doesn't go their way:\n\n* *\"These fucking refs are terrible! They're totally biased against my team! They've got it out for us! I'm going to write an angry letter to the league!\"*\n\nSound familiar? It should, because if you look around with open eyes, you'll find this exact behavioral pattern repeated at infinitum across every conceivable human endeavor.\n\nDo people hate CLOV and the masses of idiots holding it? Sure, and I don't blame them. You guys can be pretty fucking annoying. That does not, however, equate to a grand conspiracy of suppression. The fact that your copy-pasta DD got nixed just like everyone else's lazy dogshit copy-pasta is not you being singled out. It's you not understanding the rules and adapting your behavior to play within them. But hey, maybe it's easier to just blame the Mods.\n\n[\\(please don't ban me\\)](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/7mfo4sa0q3n71.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=00e9a245357f31fe49b1cf093303f400f411d546)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Part 4. Rise now, a Man of the Bag Watch**\n\nHaving taken a brief tour of Castle Black and had a bit of a feel for what it's like to be a venerable Man of the Clov Bag Watch, most of you are probably thinking: *Okay, how the fuck do I get out this chickenshit operation?*\n\nWell, you are probably still hoping for **moon**. In that regard, I've some bad news for you: ***there will be no squeeze.***\n\nThere will absolutely not be a **short squeeze**. At 15% short, there is zero chance of this happening. *\"But, bruh, the* ***real*** *short number is like 420% bruh.\"* Bullshit. Just straight bullshit.\n\nThere is also not going to be a **gamma squeeze.** Not anytime soon, and likely never. In order to get a gamma squeeze you need options that are going to be delta-hedged. But why delta-hedge options that are going to be Thanos-snapped out of existence by expiry?\n\nA while back, it looked like there could be a **mixed squeeze** (short covering + gamma hedging), but that's all in the past now. Down the road from now, could it still happen? Yeah, sure, and I could end up raw-dogging a Victoria's Secret model on the hood of my new lambo. All kinds of crazy things are ***possible***, but that doesn't make them ***likely***.\n\nAnd honestly, what the fuck is wrong with a good ol' grind up? Squeezes are fun, I get it. You get to see your money double, triple, 5x, 10x, all in the space of a day or two. You get to see those option YOLO's gain a thousand of percent in minutes. But you still make money on a grind up. A fuckload of it.\n\nI'm not sure I buy into this whole notion of a \"squeeze\" being the **Holy Grail of the Stock Market**. It's starting to sound like the Bears and their perpetual claims that they're going to make ***all the money*** on the coming collapse, all while lighting round after round of SPY puts on fire. The Squeeze Fanatics are doing the same thing, but with call options on meme stocks.\n\nBut, hey, what do I know? I'm just peon in this operation, a pitifully small cog in the great meat grinder we call the stock market. For now the chart tells me there's still **hope of up**, and so my bag watch continues. When the chart dies and there is no more good to be said of the company, then I will initiate my Bagholder Optimization Formula and there my watch will end. Until then, I man my post.\n\n[Tormund Bearfucker](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/dpx4byfpy3n71.jpg?width=961&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=55407f36e295ce5450fa607f21dfa766fc2f54c1)\n\n**Positions or Ban:**\n\n[Maybe I can try crtl-z?](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/w59n919dx3n71.jpg?width=1667&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2a10ed3b8aee187ad77f3d03404586278d97e8c4)\n\nEdits for grammar, spelling, and formatting, per usual.","63":"Auph: let\u2019s talk about gamma ramp fueled rockets \ud83d\ude80 The basics:\n\nAs a pre-cursor - This post is not intended to be too much about the fundamental basics of the company. [This](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/pmaxlb\/auph_best_treatment_against_lupus_nephritis_still\/) was posted here and did a pretty good job of that. Basically, they have a new standard of care drug that is saving lives in a rare disease. \n\nAlso, I am not a financial advisor, yada yada, this is not financial advice, yada yada standard disclaimer.\n\nNow that you\u2019re current if you read the link, let\u2019s get this thing going.\n\nAurinia is in a very special spot right now. As many of you may know, we are headed into triple witching week (simply put, the expiration of stock options, stock index futures, and stock index options all fall on the same day), this only happens four times a year and makes stocks very volatile.\n\nWhy does this make Auph special? While, for this week alone [Auph already has 27k options that are ITM](https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/quote\/AUPH\/options?date=1631836800&p=AUPH), if you include the [October calls, its 68k options ITM](https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/quote\/AUPH\/options?date=1634256000&p=AUPH). \n\nWhat's really important is when you notice that they are on the precipice of $20. As they cross $20, another 25.5k options come into the money. At $25 another 33k options come into the money from both September and October. Most stocks, especially Auph, do not attract this much out of the money buying volume, especially one week until expiration. \n\nSo what happened?\n\nUsually, you can look at this and assume a whale or someone leaked something and a move higher is coming. Many figure this is the case as 2 weeks back, a bit over 40k call options were purchased in 2 days. Why? Possibly because for multiple reasons there is speculation a buyout is coming ([pr about a buyout resulting in firings](https:\/\/www.benzinga.com\/m-a\/21\/08\/22676683\/aurinia-pharma-shares-up-3-7-following-earlier-press-release-from-co-disclosing-it-entered-deal-to-b), delisting from tsx, and multiple articles whisperings for months in reputable newspapers about buyout negotiations).\n\nThat all being said, this puts the stock in a special spot. [**Referencing this post**](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/lz8mgr\/a_deepdive_on_the_actual_math_behind_gamma\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)**, on the basics of how a gamma squeeze works,** if auph crosses 20$ on Monday morning, it should begin a gamma ramp. This process creates a runaway effect when the next set of available options also has a large OI. For example, as Auph crosses $20, MMs begin to cover their calls more aggressively as they begin to come into the money, meaning they will buy more shares. As they buy more shares, the stock price will raise, as the stock price raises, they will need to buy more shares. This is compounded especially when the next option has a large OI. With the massive OI on both September and October $20 and $25 calls, a gamma squeeze would be huge and could possibly even put the $25s in the money by the end of the week.\n\nAs a precursor to all of this, I rode GME, from 10 to 400 ( go back and check [my comment history](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/kakxrm\/gme_tribe_a_story_about_how_ryan_cohen_is_about\/gfbe9hx?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) if you don\u2019t believe me). No one really talks about it, but it was a gamma squeeze before it was a short squeeze. Auph, while not GME sits in a similar position. Over the past month during their run. They have not seen even a 1% change in short interest (current short interest is 17% of float). So after a gamma squeeze, there very well could still exist a chance for a short squeeze.\u00a0\n\n**TLDR:** Due to a massive option OI, Aurinia is ripe for a gamma squeeze **sending it much higher**. If it crosses 20, it could easily see 25. If it crosses 25, it will likely keep a runaway effect.\n\n**As a last note:** \n\nAll of this becomes moot if Aurinia is bought out before Monday morning or before calls expire at the end of the week. At this point, I would highly suggest looking to the XBI, and strong biotech tickers like MYOV (Shameless plug, but is currently undergoing a share buying program from the main owner that took it from about 20 to 27 and is only halfway complete, has a deal with PFE for $4.2b, and 3 standard of care approved indications), as well as some other strong biotech stocks that stand potential to surge in the case of AUPH money flowing to other tickers after a buyout (This happened after $TRIL buyout as well).  \n\nMy positions: \n\nAuph: 0 shares, 260 calls. September $20, $25, and $30. October $20 and $25.\n\nMyov: 22,500 shares. 210 calls, spread dates and strikes. Mostly ITM.","64":"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning September 13th, 2021 Good Friday evening to all of you here on r\/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning September 13th, 2021.\n\n# **Markets brace for hot consumer inflation report in the week ahead - [(Source)](https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2021\/09\/10\/markets-brace-for-hot-consumer-inflation-report-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n> Investors are paying close attention to any reading on inflation these days, and the consumer price index will be the big one to watch in the coming week.\n*****\n> The latest snapshot of the economy comes just a week before the Federal Reserve\u2019s important September meeting. At that meeting, the Fed is expected to discuss more details about its plan to taper down its bond buying program, or quantitative easing.\n*****\n> Market professionals say a hotter inflation reading could speed up the Fed\u2019s plans to slow the $120 billion a month in bond purchases. The paring back of its asset purchase program would be the Fed\u2019s first major step away from the easy policy it put in place to combat the pandemic.\n*****\n> The consumer price index is expected Tuesday, and there is retail sales data is released Thursday. They are expected to show consumer prices jumped at a 5.3% annual pace in August, according to the consensus estimate from FactSet, while the consumer continued to pull back from the high spending levels of earlier in the year.\n*****\n> # Hot CPI\n> \u201cIf the CPI is hotter than expected, it could make the difference between a September announcement for tapering or waiting to November,\u201d Bleakley Advisory Group chief investment officer Peter Boockvar said.\n*****\n> Economists expect CPI to rise at a 0.4% pace month over month. The report comes after August\u2019s producer price index \u2014 which was released Friday \u2014 showed a jump of 8.3% year over year, due in part to supply chain constraints.\n*****\nhttps:\/\/i.imgur.com\/3ia6fMl.png\n*****\n> The Fed\u2019s formal announcement about tapering its bond-buying program, also called QE, is widely expected in November or December. Many of those who had expected a September announcement pushed back their time frame to later in the year after August\u2019s employment report showed just 235,000 jobs added, about 500,000 less than expected.\n*****\n> \u201cCertainly the trend has been for the inflation number to come in above expectations. I think if that happens again, it will feed the narrative that high inflation is going to stick. Obviously, it\u2019s an issue for the bond market if it\u2019s viewed at all as accelerating the timing of the QE tapering, and or accelerating the timing of the first rate hike,\u201d CIBC Private Wealth U.S. chief investment officer David Donabedian said. That would be a negative for stocks.\n*****\n> \u201cIf markets have an inflation mutiny here and there\u2019s volatility as a result, they could move it up to September,\u201d Donabedian said of the Fed\u2019s taper announcement. \u201cBut I think there\u2019s kind of a one in four likelihood in my view.\u201d\n*****\n> # Stagflation?\n> That combination of higher inflation and slower spending, particularly after August\u2019s weaker jobs report, has spurred talk about the threat of stagflation. Those worries have also increased as economists ratchet back growth forecasts for the third quarter to a still high level just above 5%, from above 6%.\n*****\n> \u201cI\u2019m more about the \u2018flation\u2019 side of it than the \u2018stag.\u2019 I think the economy is going to perform fine right through next year,\u201d Donabedian said. He said the slowdown in consumer spending after stimulus checks had boosted retail sales earlier in the year is not surprising and may be just a \u201cshort-term warning.\u201d\n*****\n> \u201cWe had this explosive growth in retail sales early in the year as a direct result of stimulus payments and vaccines coming and a burst of consumer optimism. It\u2019s really settled down now,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was an enormous amount of liquidity and saving and they spent what they spent out of that extra amount of savings and you\u2019re going through a bit of a retracement here, which is why you\u2019re seeing economists mark down their third quarter estimates. Consumer fundamentals are pretty good.\u201d\n*****\n> Barclays chief U.S. economist Michael Gapen said he expects the CPI report to show that inflation is peaking, just as the Fed has said. But he says the slowing trend is not just an issue for consumer spending. It is also showing up in business spending and housing.\n*****\n> \u201cWith where labor markets are, August was a bit of an egg. But growth in employment has been solid on average, very robust over the course of the year,\u201d he said. \u201cEven though employment disappointed in August, hours and and earnings were still pretty good. There\u2019s income there for consumers to spend. We\u2019re looking at this as a short-term hiccup.\u201d\n*****\n> Gapen said third-quarter economic growth may be somewhat slower than expected. However, he said some of the lost growth could show up in the fourth quarter.\n*****\n> \u201cIt has some characteristics of stagflation, but true stagflation is rising unemployment and rising inflation. We don\u2019t have that,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are bottlenecks that are kind of constraining the pace of the recovery and lead to higher inflation. Demand isn\u2019t the problem right now. Supply is. The unemployment rate is still coming down and employment is improving. It has the whiff but I wouldn\u2019t call it stagflation.\u201d\n*****\nhttps:\/\/i.imgur.com\/tjC3emB.png\n*****\n> Donabedian expects higher prices and shortages to continue into next year, as supply chains keep getting disrupted. Some companies, including PPG and General Electric, have already commented on how they see issues with supplies stretching into 2022. Donabedian expects to see more warnings ahead of the third-quarter earnings season.\n*****\n> Stocks were lower this week, with the S&P 500 losing 1.7% to 4,458. The closely watched 10-year Treasury yield has held above 1.3% and was at 1.33% on Friday.\n*****\n> A number of strategists expect to see the stock market pullback during the typically choppy September and October period. Some say the Fed\u2019s September meeting could be a catalyst, especially if the central bank sounds particularly hawkish.\n*****\nhttps:\/\/i.imgur.com\/IP5Vq9T.png\n*****\n> \u201cWe\u2019re up over 30% in 2019, over 18% last year and over 21% in the first months of this year,\u201d Donabedian said. \u201cThese are unsustainable rates or return. ...Our takeaway is it\u2019s going to get tougher from here. Valuations are somewhat extended and this whole incredibly supportive policy framework is going to get a little less friendly.\u201d\n*****\n> # Now watch Congress\n> Donabedian said it will be important to watch discussions in Congress as it begins to put details around the infrastructure spending and what type of tax increases will be proposed to pay for it.\n*****\n> \u201cThey\u2019re going to start to fill in the blanks on where the money is going to be spent and what taxes and tax rates are going to be written into the legislation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the overall corporate tax rate, it\u2019s the tax on foreign earned income, capital gains rates and dividend tax rate. These are big investor related issues.\u201d\n*****\n> He said the market has been ignoring the tax issue. \u201cThose sort of issues went quiet over the summer but it\u2019s back full bore over the next two weeks. It will get a lot of attention.\u201d\n*****\n> The tax decisions could have big implications for corporate earnings, which have been a big driver of the stock market\u2019s gains. \u201cOne very direct way that could go wrong is if you get a large set of tax increases that go into effect in 2022. That\u2019s a direct hair cut,\u201d he said.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/N7rC5Aa.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/HWQvdLE.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/mhxbqUc.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/56EBVaE.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/h3mvijP.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/mY4BIi5.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/6zaLis8.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback\/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/DwYa3KS.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/HdA9rex.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/GDh7ITS.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/47iBGVi.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/UU3eRed.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/sHAUFMJ.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/lihZlf8.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Beige Book Decelerates As Delta Impact Widens\n\n> Earlier this week, the Federal Reserve updated its twice-quarterly qualitative assessment of the economy based on conversations with business contacts across the twelve regional districts. For each Beige Book release, we apply a natural language processing algorithm to assess the relative frequency of positive versus negative words, giving us a quantitative comparison of Beige Books over time. As shown in the chart below, our index of Beige Book activity has fallen from record levels recorded back in June to elevated but much more modest levels in September. That's consistent with the Fed's description of \"moderate\" growth thanks to the impact of the Delta variant.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https:\/\/media.bespokepremium.com\/uploads\/2021\/09\/091021-Beige.png))**\n\n> In the second chart below, we show the relationship between GDP growth and our Beige Book Index from above. As shown, the current reading of our index equates to GDP growth of a bit less than 4% YoY. But keep in mind that extreme base effects are still driving wild YoY GDP readings. With that in mind, the Beige Book Index appears to be showing above-trend but decelerating growth, when accounting for base effects of the extremely low GDP reading from Q2 of 2020.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https:\/\/media.bespokepremium.com\/uploads\/2021\/09\/091021-Beige-vs-GDP-2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Most Heavily Shorted Stocks\n\n> Over the course of 2021, we have seen some aggressive short squeezes, resulting in turmoil for certain financial institutions and millions in profits for some retail traders. The \"reddit army\" has gone after multiple stocks, most notably Game Stop (GME) and AMC (AMC). Let's dive into the 25 companies in the Russell 3,000 currently with the highest short interest as a percentage of float. Of these 25 companies, only 8 have experienced positive returns in 2021, and 6 have seen their share price half. Since GameStop peaked in late January, 20 of the companies on this list have lost value, and 9 have seen their equity trade down by 50%. Since AMC's peak in early June, 7 companies have seen price appreciation, and zero have seen their value decrease by 50%.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https:\/\/media.bespokepremium.com\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Russell-3000-Highest-SIPF.png))**\n\n> The average short interest as a percentage of float for the entirety of the Russell 3,000 is 3.46%, but certain sectors have much higher proportional short interest than others. Consumer Discretionary, Health Care, and Real Estate have the highest, while Utilities, Financials, and Consumer Staples have the lowest. High levels of short interest is a sign of negative investor sentiment, but certain sectors will consistently have higher figures due to the riskiness of their business models.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https:\/\/media.bespokepremium.com\/uploads\/2021\/09\/R3000-Sector-Short-interest.png))**\n\n> To dive deeper, let's look at the average short interest in each industry. Retail, Pharma & Biotech, and Consumer Services have the highest levels, while Banks, Tech Hardware, and Utilities have the lowest levels. The average short interest in the retailing industry is more than three times higher than that of banks for companies in the Russell 3,000.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https:\/\/media.bespokepremium.com\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Industry-avg-SIPF-Russell-3000.png))**\n\n> Although there are many exceptions to the rule, in 2021 equities with higher short interest have generally underperformed the remainder of the Russell 3,000. The average return for equities with short interest between zero and ten percent were higher than that of equities with 33%+ short interest.\n\n> To support this, let's undergo a decile analysis. The stocks in the top 20% in terms of short interest have significantly underperformed the rest of the Russell 3,000 since GME hit its highs. While the equities in the bottom 20% of short interest have averaged a 22.23% return since January 27th (GameStop's top), the top 20% of most heavily shorted stocks have declined by 1.40% on average.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https:\/\/media.bespokepremium.com\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Decile-Analysis-R3000-SIPF.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Largest 25 Stocks in the S&P 500, Now vs 20 Years Ago\n\n> Yesterday, we took a look at the makeup of the S&P 500's largest 25 companies in 2021 and compared it to that of 10 years ago. Today, we will be extending the study to 2001, twenty years ago right before the 9\/11 attacks. On the day before 9\/11, the sectors with the largest number of components in the top 25 in terms of market cap were Consumer Staples, Health Care, Technology, Financials, and Communication Services. While all of these sectors still hold a spot in the current top 25 list, the makeup has shifted substantially. Energy and Industrials, which each accounted for 8% of the top 25 companies in 2001, now have zero representation in today's list. Consumer Staples also reduced its count from five to two.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https:\/\/media.bespokepremium.com\/uploads\/2021\/09\/sector-breakdown-top-25-stocks-now-vs-2001-v2.png))**\n\n> Only four companies that made up the list of top 25 names in September 2001 remain on the list today. Those four companies are Microsoft (MSFT), J&J (JNJ), Walmart (WMT), and Pfizer (PFE). The average return of these four equities, excluding dividends, is 221.81% with a median of 129.58%. While the turnover of this list has been high over the last 20 years, every member of this list is still in operation today, but two have been undergone mergers (Time Warner & Royal Dutch Petroleum). Interestingly enough, the members of this list have approximately the same proportionate makeup of the S&P 500, with only a 1.89% increase in the weightings of the top 25 stocks now relative to September 2001.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https:\/\/media.bespokepremium.com\/uploads\/2021\/09\/2001-vs-2021-biggest-comps-SP500.png))**\n\n> The US economy today is far different than it was in 2001. As it has changed, some companies have adapted and experienced massive growth, while others have been left in the dust. Apart from the two companies that are no longer independently publicly traded, the average return of the 25 largest companies from 2001 is 92.94% with a median return of 49.08%. Over that same period, the S&P 500 has returned 310.61%.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https:\/\/media.bespokepremium.com\/uploads\/2021\/09\/2001-top-25-performance-v4.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # September Seasonal Pattern: Weakness After Mid-Month\n\n> September is the final month of the third quarter and historically it is essentially tied with August as worst month of the year. Since 1950, September is ranked last for DJIA, S&P 500, NASDAQ (since 1971) and Russell 1000 (since 1979). Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000, have fared slightly better, but historical average performance is still negative. Over the last 21 years, September has generally opened tepidly with mixed performance depending on index with Russell 2000 often rising the most through mid-month. However after mid-month, any gains have tended to fade quickly and turn into losses by month\u2019s end. Sizable losses in 2001, 2002, 2008 and 2011 weigh heavily on average performance.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https:\/\/64.media.tumblr.com\/0406c0510bf2760aa9f1ca7ca37db204\/b461817d00bd35c3-2e\/s500x750\/6431255e2d043e4c8bfa5bc2ea302c3594098196.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n> # September quarterly option expiration week: S&P 500 up 13 of last 18\n\n> September\u2019s option expiration week is up 59.0% of the time for S&P 500 since 1982. DJIA and NASDAQ have slightly weaker track records with gains 53.8% of the time and 56.4% of the time respectively. However, the week has suffered several sizable losses. The worst loss followed the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001. In the last eighteen years, S&P 500 and NASDAQ are tied for best record during September\u2019s option expiration week, up thirteen times. Friday had been firm with all three indices advancing every year 2004 to 2011, but S&P 500 has been down eight of the last nine since.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https:\/\/64.media.tumblr.com\/a78dfb81813e1a58a41595c56f0d123a\/159500c1f2844242-29\/s640x960\/97fa0711c0bca38817bcf2f7ba591836ab31bba1.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n> # What Could Happen The Rest of the Year to Stocks and Bonds?\n\n> This week in the latest LPL Market Signals podcast, Ryan Detrick and Lawrence Gillum discussed global central bank policy, recently weakening economic data, and where stocks and bonds could go the remainder of this year.\n\n> In today\u2019s blog we will focus on their discussion on stocks and bonds.\n\n> The S&P 500 Index was up more than 20% by the end of August for the first time since 1997 and it has made a new high every single month this year so far (9 for 9). Incredibly, it made 53 new highs before August was over, the most ever. Any way you slice it, this year is historic for the bulls.\n\n> The catch (and there\u2019s always a catch) is the S&P 500 hasn\u2019t pulled back 5% all year, with the last 5% pullback last October. Not to mention September is the worst month for stocks the past 10 years, 20 years, and since 1950.\n\n> But history says that great starts to a year tend to see continued strength the final four months. \u201cLooking at the previous top 10 starts to a year ever, the final four months have gained eight times,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cSo should we see any seasonal weakness, we\u2019d use it as an opportunity to buy before likely continued strength.\u201d\n\n> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, 2021 ranks as the 6th best start to a year ever. The previous top 10 best starts to a year averaged a return of 4.0% the rest of the year, with a very solid median return 5.4%.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/lplresearch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/9.8.21-Blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Turning to bonds, we continue to expect higher yields due to the growth and inflation outlook, with a target of 1.75% on the 10-year treasury yield by year end. This of course could pressure bonds, as they trade inversely with yields.\n\n> From a portfolio point of view, we would keep overall interest rate sensitivity muted and favor mortgage-backed securities and short- to intermediate-maturity investment grade corporates. As a result of our higher rates call, we suggest being underweight longer maturity high grade corporates or long-term treasuries, which are more sensitive to rising rates. So sum it up, taking a more of a defensive posture as it relates to interest rate sensitivity makes a lot of sense the remainder of 2021.\n\n> Also, the potential this week for a European Central Bank (ECB) announcement on tapering could push European yields higher, which in turn could push U.S. yields higher as well.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending September 10th, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 9.12.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * (**T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.**)\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date\/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 9.13.21 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/7kWjurx.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 9.13.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/5Os3qSw.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday  9.14.21 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/jjaTGzM.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 9.14.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/fTsIG8P.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 9.15.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/j9kTEtg.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 9.15.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 9.16.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n> # ***Thursday 9.16.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 9.17.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 9.17.21 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n**(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.).\n\n> #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https:\/\/charts.finviz.com\/chart.ashx?t=SPY&ty=c&ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&p=d&s=l))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r\/wallstreetbets. :)","65":"The mid-day update. Top trending tickers on WallStreetBets and why: AAPL, CLOV, CCJ, AMC, TSLA Welcome to today's edition of stocks that are giving the glizzy to the market.\n\nToday's top mentions include the #1 take-over by Apple that occurred over the last 30 minutes. Here they are:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* AAPL: Apple became the #1 stock mentioned on WSB at exactly 11:20am. What happened? The share price went from +0.50% to -3% in a matter of minutes. It's actually amazing how fast WSB is to take note of any action in the market. The correlating AAPL chart is below so you can see the change of mentions on the first chart vs the stock price.\n* CLOV: This stock seems to have taken the #1 squeeze name on WSB. My theory is that AMC and GME are old news and now CLOV, which is seemingly under-valued from reaching almost $30 just a couple months ago, has the potential to fly again.\n* CCJ: A new name on the list and kind of unusual for WSB (uranium play??).

Briefly, the insiders (i.e. people who owned stock before it went public) stand to get a bonus if the share price stays above $20 for a specific time period. And now I would like to follow up as to why the share price will continue to rise:\n\nI think everyone would agree that the insiders like money. Obviously, they are going to do everything they can to maintain a floor of $20 so they get their bonuses. What happens when you raise the floor? You raise the ceiling of course! IMO, the stock is still undervalued, and \"flying under the radar\" in the greater financial community. Remember when articles about $GME started appearing in the MSM?

I'm retarded**\n\n# Synopsis:\n\nI usually think of getting into a position based on where I think the company can disrupt inside of current culture. Now I don't know about you, but in today's world of free porn, the ability to swipe on hundreds of potential matches (bumble\/tinder) has put a lot of pressure on guys\/girls to look and feel their best. But who wants to walk into a doctors office and tell the 75 year old man that he is having a hard time getting it up? Or that his hair is going away? Or that she wants to clear those dots off her skin. It's 2021. Can't we text you?\n\n***$HIMS takes away the pressure of going to a doctor to try and explain why you want some blue bombers.

Management holds nearly 40% of the stock.  Stock is near all time lows.\n\n$HIMS originally guided for 2021 revenue of $179 million *before* going public. Now guiding for $255 in 2021, ahead of the 2022 revenue projections.\n\n# The Sector:\n\nTelemedicine has exploded since the COVID plandemic has hit. People are realizing not only can you work from home, but you can get most of your basic health needs done from the tap of a few buttons rather than in a waiting room. Sure, if you have a rash on your junk, you should probably see a doctor. But hey, if you want to kick it up a notch with the ladies... Hydrate your skin or just consider getting some more of your hair back.. Why would you walk into an office? This sector is growing at such a rapid pace, it's going to become more normal than a specialty. Kind of like.. you know calling someone versus texting someone.\n\n# The looks of the company:\n\nIf you look at the marketing and branding, they feel young and fresh. Partnering with people like Gronk (Bucs player) \/ Miley Cyrus (singer) and the look\/appeal of the website reminds me a lot of what brought a lot of success to companies like Lululemon, or hell even Apple if you want to go that far. Keep it clean, keep it simple. They are focused on a target that uses phones as part of their daily ritual. A target that uses TikTok\/IG for advice versus listening to the boomers at the dinner table.\n\n# End thoughts:\n\nWhile I don't know if the stock will ultimately go up, i do believe at this price... the risk is well worth the reward. It won't rocket like $GME\/$AMC on some meme dream, but if you hold it for a while we could see a similar pattern to what happened with $TDOC. I have no gay bear thesis here, because we all know stonks only go up.\n\nGL out there traders. $HIMS is still at an incredible price.","69":"Stop buying dumpster fires and buy ASO I\u2019ve refrained from writing a post here on my position in ASO for a while because I don\u2019t want to peddle my shit  and turn this thing into a meme stock (or do i) but I feel like I\u2019d be doing a disservice to my fellow retards by not sharing a major value story here with y\u2019all. GME made me more money than I've ever had, so I hope this can do something like that for some of yall, truly. \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nQuick Pitch\n\nASO is at a P\/E ratio of 6.6 -7, with revenue $6+ billion, increasing margins and more profitable than ever, amarket cap of only $3.5b and their debt load being dramatically reduced ahead of schedule. Heavily owned by institutions, KKR dramatically reducing their majority shareholder % to now only 20%. A share repurchase program for $500mil and a lot of insider buying and Ken Hicks who turned Footlocker around took their share price straight up\u2026. How and why are people you guys not buying this up? This 6% dip this morning is probably the best value you can get on the market. Its pretty much an anomaly in today\u2019s market climate. \n\nDKS (Dicks sporting goods) PE ratio is at a 11\/12. If ASO was adjusted to just a PE of 9 they would be somewhere around $58.00 a share which is a 45% increase from where we are at today. 9 is extremely fair. As the best and most efficient retailor in the market they should be a 15 or $85 a share. \n\nASO, Academy Sports and Outdoors, is massively undervalued compared to its peers and it is the best player in the space. Why aren\u2019t retail investors piling into this for locked  gains has me confused? It\u2019s a real company with real customers that are loyal and lifers of Academy, many have been shopping there since they were kids and now it\u2019s where they shop for their kids.  My guess is investors see Covid days as good as it\u2019s going to get for Academy, but the reopening is proving to be even bigger and permanent than expected.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nIt\u2019s important to know where Academy stores are located and who they serve. Academy has 259 mostly in the Southeast. They are a low\/mid cost sports and outdoors retailer. Think youth sports, gym clothes, and camping\/fishing \/hunting gear. Their stores are often the only specialty retailer in a suburban area and some more heavily populated areas where ASO and Dicks compete (and in those area ASO wins every time). Their customers tend to be more blue-collar simpler consumers who would rather touch and feel the products vs order online for convenience, even though online sales have picked up drastically recently. Not having a strong online presence is not something that should turn you away from this stock. Nobody buys fishing equipment, camping gear, your child\u2019s sports equipment online, these are things you want to touch and feel and try on and especially with this crowd of consumers.\n\nLike I said I think investors look at covid lockdowns as if it were ASO\u2019s best days, in fact I think this is why KKR ultimately decided to take them public after seeing 2 monster quarters back-to-back, they knew their valuation would be higher than it\u2019s ever been and thought better take advantage of this fluke. I believe retailers are valued at IPO on their previous 2 quarters. But they didn\u2019t expect to keep having monster record earnings afterwards so turns out they jumped the gun. Here\u2019s why it will continue at least for a couple more quarters. Q2 last year we were completely shut down, sure exercise equipment and bike sales were through the roof, but youth sports and other sections came to a screeching halt. Now you have a massive reopening trade that will last a couple quarters longer as kids get back to each of their respective sports (each season) after a year hiatus and adults get back to their hobbies. Kids grow fast and I\u2019m predicting this sector of the business will be on fire for a bit as parents have to replace outgrown equipment. This should bring more traffic to their stores than ever Academy is doing well and will continue to do well because they have a massive loyal following in the South with a product mix that\u2019s borderline recession proof and mostly resilient to online retailers. \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nComps\n\n21\u2019 Guidance compared to 19\u2019 Pre-Covid\n\n\\-  Q2 Net Income at $560,000,000 up from $120,000,000 in 2019\u2013 increase of 352%\n\n\\-  Net Sales at $6.5B up from $4.8B in 2019 \u2013 increase of 35% \n\n\\-  EPS - $5.45-$5.80 up from $1.60 \u2013 increase of 252%\n\n21\u2019 guidance compared to 20\u2019 numbers (keep in mind 20\u2019 was thought to be their record fluke sales year)\n\n\\-  Q2 Net Income at $560,000,000 up from $309,000,000 in 2020 \u2013 increase of 76%\n\n\\-  Net Sales at $6.5B up from 5.689B in 2020 \u2013 increase of 15%\n\n\\-  EPS - $5.45-$5.80 up from $3.79 in 2020 \u2013 increase of 48%\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nOther bullish indicators\n\n\\-  Gross margin increased 29.4% to $642.5 million, the highest quarterly gross profit in the Company's history. The gross margin rate improved by 500 basis points to 35.9%. This growth was primarily driven by stronger merchandise margins from a favorable product mix shift, higher average unit retails and less promotional activity.\n\n\\-  The company also took steps to enhance its balance sheet. As of the end of the second quarter, the Company\u2019s cash and cash equivalents totaled $553.8 million with no outstanding balance on its credit facility. Adjusted free cash flow was $169.5 million. Merchandise inventories were $1.1 billion, an increase of 24.0% compared to the prior year quarter and 3.2% compared to Q1 2021.\n\n\\-  Academy's largest shareholder (KKR) completed two transactions, reducing their ownership to approximately 20% of the Company as of the end of the quarter.\n\n\\-  As part of one of these events, Academy purchased and retired 3.2 million shares for approximately $100 million.\n\n\\-  In addition to the stock repurchase, the Company paid down $99 million of its outstanding term loan and refinanced the loan's interest rate from LIBOR + 5.0% to LIBOR + 3.75%. Based on these positive actions, S&P (B+ from B) and Moody's (Ba3 from B1) both upgraded the Company's debt rating.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nIm long 6,350 shares at $37.30 basis. \n\nI'll let others talk about the Short Interest attached to ASO and any potential squeezes. I think its a buy  with easy 50-100% upside regardless of any of that. That would all be bonus. But if this thing does move to $50-$55 quickly it could really trap some of the shorts and gap up pretty quickly. \n\nPlease take advantage of this and stop buying Discord pump and dumps.","70":"Fap on loss porn addiction (FOLPA) Listen up guys a retard has a serious problem here.

They are the [pick & shovel](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/p\/pick-and-shovel-play.asp) play of a rapidly growing sports gambling segment ([gambling record $44bn in revenue 2021](https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/willyakowicz\/2021\/08\/10\/us-gambling-revenue-to--break-44-billion-record-in-2021\/)).

Their primary claim is that Genius is a \u201cmiddleman\u201d with an \u201cinferior business model\u201d saying the stock could fall 60% to 80%, so a PT of $3.25 to $6.50. Well first off Spruce, fuck your bitch and the clique you claim.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/i.redd.it\/uk0m1vhlxbm71.gif\n\nWith that being said, Spruce is so so so wrong.  Given Spruce\u2019s history of abject failure I would go further and say this report is baseless FUD. So, why would Spruce put itself in the path of a runaway train like Jenaay? Seems crazy tbh. Welp they\u2019re known as a [\u201cSmash & Grab\u201d short seller,](https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2021-01-27\/reddit-jolts-activist-short-hedge-funds-into-adapt-or-die-mode) so these guys give friends an early view of their calls so they can front run the market before it's released to the public, profiting from the panic.  Spruce\u2019s hit piece was released Aug 5th, the stock rose the entire day and it\u2019s been in a legit uptrend since then, no panic lol. If this is Spruce\u2019y bois M.O. they just fukd their company and their friends with another horrible call.

More importantly however, is this rising floor Cathie is building into the stock price. She is known for having strong convictions and sticking to them.

It\u2019s almost as if GENI has an unconscionably small float that\u2019s being aggressively bought by diamond handz Cathie while the MM buys remaining float shares to hedge calls.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/6qtw0aerxbm71.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=b125abc619b0d2f3f96966ac63eff445603328cf\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/i.redd.it\/ipnyrecsxbm71.gif\n\n# Part 2: Fundamentals\n\nGENI is the backbone\/infrastructure play on sports betting since they supply the  data that major gambling companies use.  GENI offers a suite of four products:\n\n* **GeniusLive**: this is a vertically integrated video service that allows teams or sports leagues to launch something like NBA League Pass. So the platform supports payments, live statistics, advertising, live streaming, and video on-demand, without having to buy a bunch of extra software\/hardware.\n* **Sporttech:** Data capture, management and analysis tools that help leagues run their sport, unlock new revenue streams, and protect the integrity of their competitions. This is essentially the shit that has turned Facebook from some site used to scam on girls in  college into a company with revenues of over $10B a year. GENI collects all the data from degenerate bets, and provides the information gathered from them to their partners for future use.\n* **Sportsbook:** GENI provides the capability (but not requirement) to build out an entire sportsbook platform for their partners.  This provides all the benefits of having a sportsbook with none of the risk of spending capital on a field GENI partners are unfamiliar with.\n* **Media & Engagement:**  GENI has the platform capabilities to allow their partners sports betting experience to enter into the world of social media.  You can chat in real time with other sports betters and complain that Nick Chubb stepped out at the 1 yard line and completely boned your 3 bet parlay. Through this platform GENI can leverage their fan engagement capabilities to drive advertising revenue and also promote future bets that may be to your liking based on your prior activity.\n\nAs  mentioned Genie\u2019s only real competition in this space is Sportradar, but Sportradar\u2019s [SPAC merger fell through](https:\/\/www.casino.org\/news\/sportradar-filed-for-a-highly-anticipated-ipo-on-tuesday\/) after GENI swooped the exclusive rights to the NFL from under them -- ya know, the ole\u2019 Bulgarian ambush perfected by Vlad.\n\nThe NFL deal is pretty significant so let\u2019s dive into it:\n\n* **Expensive af**: Genius will [pay the NFL $120 million a year over six years](https:\/\/www.legalsportsreport.com\/53865\/nfl-betting-official-league-data-dispute\/), with half paid in warrants making the [NFL own roughly 5% of GENI](https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/now\/nfl-stake-genius-nearly-15-215504358.html).\n* **Locked in profit**:  Sportradar was pulling in 1.5% to 2% of in-play gross gaming revenue (GGR) on NFL wagers \\[[source](https:\/\/sportshandle.com\/sportradar-genius-nfl-data\/)\\].  Genius decided to go the opposite route by jacking up rates; asking for around 4% of operators\u2019 pre-match NFL betting revenues and 6% of in-play \\[[source](https:\/\/www.legalsportsreport.com\/53865\/nfl-betting-official-league-data-dispute\/)\\].

As of now, [DraftKings has already partnered with GENI in a multi year deal](https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2021\/08\/05\/draftkings-partners-with-genius-sports-for-sports-betting.html?utm_term=Autofeed&utm_medium=Social&utm_content=Main&utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1628161383), PointsBet, WynnBet, BetMGM, Caesars, and Fox Bet have also signed deals w\/ Genius ([NFL names Fox Bet, PointsBet, BetMGM and WynnBet as Approved Sportsbook Operators](https:\/\/www.gamblinginsider.com\/news\/12973\/nfl-names-fox-bet-pointsbet-betmgm-and-wynnbet-as-approved-sportsbook-operators)).

Sucks for them, great for us.\n\n* **Sticky**: The Sportradar deal was inked in 2019 and they got cucked in 2021. Sad. GENI is proactively making moves to make the deal last longer than 6yrs by hiring a good amount of NFL vets. Including [Steve Bornstein](https:\/\/www.sportico.com\/personalities\/executives\/2021\/genius-sports-steve-bornstein-1234637226\/), he now leads GENI\u2019s US business. Mans spent a decade at the NFL managing the media strategy, and spent multiple decades at ESPN and ABC.  He also was the CEO of ESPN for a cool min.\n* **NFL shills for GENI**:  This cannot be reinforced enough: the NFL\u2019s chief concern is the integrity of the data provided, and they are entrusting GENI, and ONLY GENI, with that.  They will also force anyone who wants to do business with the NFL to adhere to the NFL\u2019s core integrity policies by [agreeing to license all Official League Data from GENI](https:\/\/www.nfl.com\/news\/nfl-announces-agreements-with-four-approved-sportsbook-operators)\n\nTo put this in simpler terms: the NFL is telling the world -if you want us, you\u2019re gettin\u2019 some GENI.   GENI also issued warrants to the NFL (5% stake in GENI)  meaning when GENI is successful the NFL is successful so they are locked in and incentivized to push GENI to anyone who wants to work with them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/i.redd.it\/l3e1xpncxbm71.gif\n\nThe reason I\u2019m bullish on Genie and jacked with shares\/options other than the regular \u201c*it could squeeeeez*e\u201d play which I know, love, and bang the shit out of, and will explain this angle later, is because Genie secured the NFL deal at the perfect time. So, 3 yrs ago the supreme court overturned the ban on sports betting. The NFL has responded by moving its business model towards generating significant amts of revenue through betting. Sucks for Sporttrader, since for most of the time they held the  exclusive rights to NFL data, the [NFL actually considered gambling to be threat](https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/sports\/2021\/08\/25\/nfl-sports-betting\/)**\ud83d\ude31**, what a bad position to be in going into the gambling golden age.\n\nThe NFL expects to make $270m in revenue from sports-betting this yr, and  NFL execs are super bullish about their future sports betting revenue, here\u2019s a quote from one:\n\n>*You can definitely see the market growing to $1 billion-plus of league opportunity over this decade.\\[*[*source*](https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/sports\/2021\/08\/25\/nfl-sports-betting\/)*\\]*\n\nThe ideal sports-gambling legislation, the NFL concluded, would include substantive licensing requirements creating clear and transparent markets that protect consumers.

This lets me invest in a more  logical and clear headed way. I compare this situation to the girl that sat next to you pre-OnlyFans. She used to eat ramen for lunch. A couple years later she has a poodle, a G Wagon, and goes by \u201cCyrstal like the champagne\u201d instead of Bernice. Yah, she twerking on cam because she found a money printer, the NFL will twerk to online-betting.  Analogy.***\n\n*The whole industry will be twerking.*\n\nCathie Wood\u2019s a month before she started yolo\u2019n on Jenaaay estimated x10 increase in domestic sports betting handle (the amount of money wagered by bettors is called \u201chandle\u201d), to $180 billion by 2025 , with revenue\u2019s for the sector projected to sky at a 31% CAGR.\n\nOne reason for this bullish prediction is the New Jersey example; since NJ legalized online sports betting mid-2018, they've seen online handle moon to $15 billion, 1\/2 of this took place in 2020. (*Don\u2019t know why people would yolo on sports and* [*not options*](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/pg9jpn\/why_doesnt_everyone_only_trade_options_0_dte_spy\/)*, but to each their own lulz*).\n\nSportsbetting is picking up so much steam, ESPN keeps their own tracker for up to date info on which states are going to let you yolo rent $ on Appalachian State vs Syracuse:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/g68ri70exbm71.png?width=1272&format=png&auto=webp&s=95e3af4ca366eb8d64ba23ac0f970d51bdac69b8\n\nThere are only 3 states (Utah, Idaho, and Wisconsin - which btw if you live in any of these places - move the fuck out) that do not currently allow for sports betting and\/or are in the process of allowing it.  Ground floor opportunity here.\n\n[Earlier this month, Wyoming Awarded Genius Sports Inaugural Sports Betting License - upping the number of states GENI can operate in to 15. ](https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/wyoming-awards-genius-sports-inaugural-213000130.html)\n\nSo clearly Jenaayy is a growth stock but let\u2019s look at the fundamentals & also how Genie compares to the competition. (Genie, Jenaayy, GENI, Genius \u2026 lol sorry I\u2019m  dislexic). Ya so  Sportradar (Genie\u2019s rival)  is slated to go public this year and will likely trade in the $10-12B valuation range \\[[article\/source](https:\/\/www.sportico.com\/business\/finance\/2021\/sportradar-ten-billion-valuation-1234623092\/)\\].\n\nSportradar filed its S-1 a few weeks ago which provides historical financial performance.  Making some simple assumptions on continued revenue growth (based on historic CAGR) we can figure out Sportradar\u2019s valuation multiples which we\u2019ll compare to Jenaayyy\u2019s.  I\u2019m also throwing in Draftkings in the comparison as a high growth (but unprofitable), pure play sportsbook leader.  You can see below how the financials compare:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/1f6alqkfxbm71.png?width=1258&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c25a5c75f0ca5b4498d9883053284138e273ec7\n\nI would argue Genie and Sportradar should trade at a premium to Draftkings as they have an effective duopoly on the sports betting data market.  Draftkings\u2019 sports book market is getting more competition from new players, which is causing customer acquisition costs to skyrocket.  HOWEVER, as more of these players enter the market, they\u2019ll have to buy all their official sports data from Jenaayy!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/i.redd.it\/fk2cxfmgxbm71.gif\n\nLet\u2019s get serious for a sec,, below is a valuation comparison and as you can see Genie trades at a discount to DKNG and at a premium to Sportradar\u2019s expected IPO pricing valuation of $26-29 or $7.4B - $8.2B. It\u2019s expected that Sportradar will trade in the $10B - $12B range once it starts trading.  Genie should probs trade at a premium to Sportradar valuation given the enormous potential of its exclusive NFL deal over the coming years. Vauling Genie at a premium would imply a conservaitve estimate of $25 to $30 price per share based on the company\u2019s CURRENT projections..\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/f75x253ixbm71.png?width=1260&format=png&auto=webp&s=d5a6d0efe77944fcd133102ba7e3424f6b93b026\n\nGenie reported Q2 earnings on 9\/8 which beat estimates.  Revenue was $55.8M and EBITDA $5.2M vs. street estimates of revenue $53.8M and EBITDA $1.7M.  Genie tightened its FY2022E guidance to $250M-$260M of revenue (which was increased in Q1 from $190M) and EBITDA of $10M-$20M.\n\nDon\u2019t take my word for i though, Wall Street analysts agree with their Price Targets:\n\n* Benchmark BUY $33 PT\n* Oppenheimer BUY $32 PT\n* Goldman Sachs BUY $31 PT\n* Craig Hallum BUY $30 PT\n* Needham BUY $28 PT\n* Singular Research BUY $28 PT\n\nThese 12-month price targets equate to an average $30.33 or 43 % upside from the current stock price.\n\nSome other data points:\n\n* GENI is in a $330M net cash position\n* Does it pay a dividend? Of course not\n* Free cash flow is absolutely atrocious - the company is in reinvest and GROWTH mode\n* Holy fuck is price to sales looks steep based on 2020A at 27.9x, but gets cut in half by 2022E at 12.3x due to massive growth\n* Positive seasonality outlook, very volatile but shows recently strong performance\n* Sales forecast looks great, with a forecasted growth of 126% from 2020 to 2022\n* First quarter group revenues of 52% year-over year\n* First quarter group adj.

Other redditors have come up with extensions of the general idea. I\u2019m going to do a breakdown of similar data from past analysis, including FTD rates and float comparisons, institutional ownership and recalculation of all this data (differs from online).\n\nAs of now, the outstanding shares listed on Yahoo and sites such as [Stock Analysis](https:\/\/stockanalysis.com\/stocks\/geni\/statistics\/) is 191.51M shares. \\[However, the float varies, with Yahoo listing it as 63.36M and other sites listing it as 58.66M.\\]\n\n\\*\\*The current float can be calculated as follows:\\*\\*SPAC IPO:    27.6M shares\n\nUnlocked PIPE:   33M shares\n\nFollow-On Offering:   22M shares\n\n**Total tradable float:**   **82.6M shares**\n\n**Lock up:**\n\nManagement (34.9M shares \/ 18% ownership) lockup expires on 11\/17 and the SPAC Sponsor lockup (6.825M shares \/ 3.5% ownership) lockup expires on 10\/17.

Lets see.**\n\n**Begin Math:**\n\nGiven **191.51M shares outstanding** as the general consensus across various financial sources, we can look into the overall preferred shares and institutional buyouts across several 13F filings and aggregated data on Fintel and StockAnalysis:\n\n**Top 3 Institutional Holdings:**\n\n1. Caledonia Investments - 16,305,582 shares\n2. Fred Alger Management - 15,046,102 shares\n3. Dmy Sponsor LLC - 6,825,000 shares\n\nThese top 3 holders combined have 38176684 shares or about 19.93% of the shares outstanding.\n\nThere are 137 other funds that also own shares directly, for a total of 63694543 shares or about another 33.26% of the shares outstanding.\n\nTherefore, institutional ownership alone is around (19.93% + 33.26%) or 53.19% of shares outstanding.\n\nNext we can take a look at the insider transactions. This has a general consensus of 19.25%, indicating that a total of 72.44% of the outstanding shares are owned currently.\n\nNow lets take a look at merger deals, ETFs and ownership through mutual funds.\n\nWe can see that the top holders for Q2 of 2021 in aggregate own 17,422,176 shares or about 9.10% of shares outstanding.  \\[source fintel\\]\n\n**Our total ownership of outstanding shares becomes 81.54%.**\n\nHowever, now we need to account for any institutions holding shares through these funds and for this reason some ETFs are excluded. Fred Alger Management has 15,046,102 shares of GENI yet through the ATFV Alger\u2019s ETF, they end up owning approximately\u2026 oh wait.. Lol\u2026 approximately an equivalent of 75 shares of GENI. Okay so looking at these ETFs looks like they have negligible impact on the float.\n\n**TLDR; The float for $GENI is about 35,352,746 shares or about 18.46% of outstanding shares.**  **With 4.14M** shares shorted this means that approximately **11.7% of the float is shorted.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/dvse6w5vxbm71.png?width=1310&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab367a73760c2e67324adb2459b7797512f474f7\n\nFrom the FTD angle we see that nice giant spike with the price staying stable\/bleeding up.

Without 2) and 3) not a lot would happen.\n\nSo in short, Uranium mines pretty much tuned down mining over the years due to demand but also because they are in a bad position. Most uranium buyers will only purchase short to mid term what they need instead of making contracts. Since these buyers exist in smaller amounts but with huge impact they can control what happens with the price, pretty much. So production went along with this and decreased to a minimum that can barely cover the needs and even slight interruptions that go on for a while would cause major issues.\n\nNow fast forward to the current date.\n\nThis is already 3) named Sprott.\n\nIf you don't know Sprott: \"Sprott is a global investment manager specializing in precious metals and real assets investing.\"\n\nWhat did they do? Well, don't take my word for it, let Bloomberg tell you what's going on:\n\n>Sprott has amassed **over 24 million pounds** of uranium, sometimes buying more than 500,000 pounds in a single day, according to its website and social media account. For comparison, total spot volume for 2020 was 92.2 million pounds, according to uranium investor Yellow Cake Plc.\n\n[https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2021-09-08\/uranium-surges-to-six-year-high-as-fund-buys-up-physical-supply#:\\~:text=Sprott%20has%20amassed%20over%2024,uranium%20investor%20Yellow%20Cake%20Plc](https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2021-09-08\/uranium-surges-to-six-year-high-as-fund-buys-up-physical-supply#:~:text=Sprott%20has%20amassed%20over%2024,uranium%20investor%20Yellow%20Cake%20Plc).\n\nThe expectation here is not a short squeeze as of now. The main expectation is an insane surge in price due to the tight demand-supply that was floating around Uranium and is now majorly interrupted. With how tight it is Sprott can pretty much control the price to an extend and that's why it's going crazy.\n\n**So what's with media support?**\n\n[**https:\/\/www.kitco.com\/news\/2021-09-07\/Sprott-s-investment-in-uranium-is-paying-off-and-it-s-just-the-start.html**](https:\/\/www.kitco.com\/news\/2021-09-07\/Sprott-s-investment-in-uranium-is-paying-off-and-it-s-just-the-start.html)\n\nWell, you are free to look for yourself, but it started and is as expected. The move of them is hyped up like crazy and this has by far not over at all. The initial price surge came from the news of them buying and announcing it, for a reference:\n\n[SPROTT announces their purchase program of Uranium](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/hwy29fg1ram71.png?width=946&format=png&auto=webp&s=85af49792f5012cb2166d0e63e736e452c0d2bff)\n\nThe media coverage is there and it's just starting off. If you search for Uranium and go 1 month, 1 wekk and 1 day back on the Google search you'll see an exponential increase in articles despite the way less time a single day has compared to an entire week.\n\n**But what's the future of Uranium?**\n\nI can't tell you what happens, if that was the case I'd be rich, sitting on a bought island and slurping cocktails 24\/7. But this move caused by a company, not by a random action or idea - so it's their own interest to make the most out of it and considering what they just caused they are most certainly no idiots. The first impact is the announcement and what people understand will follow: A lack of supply. So why shouldn't mines just produce more? They sold a ton to SPROTT and could now satisfy the lack of product, right? Well, not really. If they do this, SPROTT will most likely decline or stop buying more, meaning their bumped up production is completely wasted for a one time pay off that might not even be good for them. But wait, it gets worse - for the Uranium buyers. A ton of nuclear power stations are opening. Nuclear Power is pretty much green energy with a bad side effect of radioactivity, but that's why it was pushed more and more. It's by far better for the environment than coal, which countries move away from - at least if they care about the environment.\n\nSo combined: Miners will most likely not increase production because they would shoot into their own foot (their ultimate goal is longterm well paying contracts), demand for Uranium will surge up in the next months and years and SPROTT doesn't stop buying current production. No matter what happens the price will keep surging since SPROTT can pretty much set the price they want, but in a likely case this might spiral to levels that we had back in 2011 with 70-80$ or heck even 140$ in 2007. Mind you a big move away from Nuclear Power Plants happened a while ago and with the new found hype for Uranium and the given issues this could become bigger than ever before.\n\n**So what do I do if I want to join?**\n\nAs mentioned you can either buy CCJ. All 3 are well performing among this surge. Don't get me wrong, all Uranium stocks have surged like crazy recently, but most options trading happens in CCJ while.\n\nNo financial advise of course, just sharing what my dummy brain was able to gather.","76":"Daily Popular Tickers Thread for September 08, 2021 - CLOV | GME | AMC \nYour daily hype and or containment thread.

The world is producing roughly 125 million pounds from primary mining, 25 million pounds from secondary sources and consuming roughly 180 million pounds, for an overall deficit of 30 million pounds a year. This deficit will only increase in future years, as additional reactors come online. If you want to quibble with my numbers, quibble away. I know I\u2019m off by a few million pounds, but so is everyone else. No one really knows the true numbers\u2014which is what makes commodity markets so fascinating in the first place. All that matters is that there is a deficit, it\u2019s a big percentage of total production, new mines are not coming online at current prices and existing mines have had years of under-investment\u2014hence production should continue to trail off without new investment.\n\nHow large are the above-ground stockpiles? No one knows. All we know is that they\u2019re drawing down rapidly and outside of government entities, most of the stockpiles are spoken for by utilities, which are using their uranium to fabricate finished products for their reactors. However, a new class of investors has entered the market and they\u2019ve completely upended the equilibrium.\n\nRemember, GBTC?? I remember it quite fondly. What if I told you there\u2019s another entity doing the same thing in uranium, but it is cornering the free float at a rate that makes the boys at GBTC look like amateurs? What if the free float is organically shrinking due to the supply deficit? What will happen as institutional investors jam themselves into a far smaller market? Fukit, who cares? Someone intends to conduct this science experiment; consequences be damned. Importantly, this entity is using an At The Market offering (ATM). Hence, it immediately produces free trading shares; increasing trading volume far more rapidly than GBTC with its 6-month hold\u2014making acquisition by institutional investors possible and driving adoption. Basically, it\u2019s GBTC 2.0\u2014issue shares to buy product. Every day. Relentlessly. Except, against a smaller and shrinking asset class.\n\nUranium is different\u2014almost everyone who owns uranium today, owns it because they intend to consume it in their reactors\u2014these owners are all incremental buyers going forward. In a market with a deficit, they\u2019re all implicitly short uranium. With an entity buying up the free float, they\u2019re going to get squeezed. We all know how squeezes work, but I don\u2019t know of any similar scenario where the squeeze was as aggressive or blatant. The utilities are blissfully unaware, they\u2019re eventually going to panic and pay any price for uranium as a reactor that runs out of uranium is just an expensive paperweight.\n\nSprott Physical Uranium Trust commonly known as SPUT (SRUUF\u2013 Canada), is the entity that has upended the uranium market. **Since launching its ATM 13 days ago, it has acquired 2.7 million pounds of uranium**. This is an average daily rate in excess of 200,000 pounds or roughly a third of global production on an annual basis**. If GBTC is the roadmap to follow, as the price of uranium begins to appreciate, the inflows into the trust should accelerate. Interestingly, there are plenty of other entities also purchasing physical uranium, uranium that utilities were counting on for their future needs. The squeeze is on.**\n\nAs expected, the utilities are blissfully unaware. Surprised?? I\u2019m not. Utilities are quasi-governmental agencies, managed by the types of fukwits who\u2019d work at your local DMV, except they enjoy stock options. The fact that they\u2019ve ignored the coming squeeze shouldn\u2019t be surprising. Inevitably, they\u2019ll demand rate increases to buy back this uranium\u2013it\u2019s not their money anyway. This is your bid at some point in the future.\n\nCommodities are determined by supply and demand. Uranium is a small market at roughly $6.3 billion in annual consumption (180 million pounds at $35\/lb). SPUT has raised approximately $85 million in the 13 days since the ATM went live. It\u2019s hoovering up supply and is already struggling to procure pounds, as shown by their increasing cash balance\u2014cash that they\u2019re legally forced to spend. \n\n**Something is going to give here, and I suspect it\u2019s the price of uranium.**\n\nIn any case, when I saw the rate at which SPUT was issuing shares, I legged into a rather large pile of SPUT. I\u2019m also long a few producers along with some juniors for extra kick. (Please don\u2019t ask me which\u2014if I wanted to name them, I would have). Uranium just broke out to 5-year highs. New highs bring in publicity, which often brings in new buyers and the cycle repeats. I like buying new highs from a big base\u2014especially with SPUT out there playing Pac-Man. I pulled back my exposure all summer as I was awaiting something interesting. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll see anything better than uranium for a while. Let\u2019s just say that I\u2019m suddenly back to being VERY fully invested.\n\nBy Tyler Durden - On zero hedge\n\nI'm IN. This could be massive.","78":"Daily Popular Tickers Thread for September 07, 2021 - CLOV | GME | AMC \nYour daily hype and or containment thread. Please keep the shitposting to a maximum.

I'm not arrogant enough to claim I know everything to do with this and won't pretend to. Do your own DD, come up with your own conclusions, and remember the economy always goes up until it doesn't.\n\nOutside of a few select stock subreddits that I shall not name here, not many people seem to be talking about Reverse Repos and their subsequent effect on the market. Let's fix that, shall we?\n\n**What are Overnight Reverse Repos (ONRRP)?**\n\nI'm not gonna bore the shit out of y'all with a bunch of technical jargon so I shall simplify it (and note: this is a *simplification* and therefore some nuance and detail is not included, so go fuck yourself if you feel the need to be an ass about something I didn't include.)\n\nReverse Repo's are basically an agreement between the Federal Reserve (which is *not* the same thing as the Federal government) and large financial institutions (banks, hedge funds, Market Makers, your wife's boyfriend, etc.) that basically boils down to the Fed giving these institutions a \"specified security\" (usually U.S. Treasury Bonds) in exchange for cash. Now, since the government is stingy with their T-Bonds and Financial institutions might need their money back at a moment's notice, these transactions are essentially reversed at the end of the day.\n\nThe Reverse Repo Program (Or RRP for short) is \"officially\" used to tighten the money supply. (Note how I said officially, I'll come back to that later.)\n\nNow, there is another program that is sometimes mentioned, called the Repo Program, which is basically the opposite of the Reverse Repo. It is used to \"inflate\" the money supply in the economy. I will not go into much more detail on this program since I have used my remaining few brain cells to understand Reverse Repos and not much else.\n\n**Cool, but, like, why?**\n\nSo to understand why this program is essential to \"control the money supply\" (aka Decrease Inflation), you have to understand one thing about these big financial institutions.\n\n**Cash = Bad**\n\nSeems counterintuitive, right?  Well, sort of. Basically, cash in itself is bad for these businesses because of one simple reason; Inflation. Cash is considered a liability (a risk) on their balance sheets when it's just sitting there not doing anything. Does the phrase \"Use money to make money\" ring a bell? Regardless, Institutions need to have most of their money in investments in order to not lose money and any opportunities to make money.\n\nNow that we've gotten that out of the way, let's talk about what exactly these bad boys have been doing for the last year and a half.\n\n**What the Fed doin'?**\n\nHere I'm going to lay out the facts of the matter and leave the speculation as to the why's further down in the next section. So, I hope y'all like pictures.\n\nStarting in March of this year, The RRP had begun to be used after nearly a year of nothing. This began after margin requirements for banks were reinstated in March after the Fed had significantly lowered them to help the economy after the COVID crash.\n\n[RRP Market Aug '20 - Sep '21](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/0ps7veqajyl71.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f951259466fbd0f5eeb5b9ffe7d4a7cc4352169)\n\nIt has only increased since.\n\nNot only that, the *way* it has increased is rather unusual compared to the past. Up until around late 2018, the RRP market was used rather frequently but usually only during Quater ends. \n\n[RRP Market '13 - '21](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/w3c1nsqdjyl71.png?width=1171&format=png&auto=webp&s=097526b85b2ff45ffb9d813ec22b26e98bc20861)\n\nSo this sharp increase with seemingly no correlation with Quarter ends has led to a lot of people smelling the bullshit so to speak.\n\n**1 Trilly Baby**\n\nSince August 11th, the RRP has been above 1 Trillion and has, as of August 31st, hit a high of 1.189 Trillion. The previous high before this year was around $474 billion in 2015, right at the end of Quater 4.\n\n**Why is this happening?**\n\nThe simple answer is that we don't know. Don't pull out the pitchforks quite yet, there are a few theories as to why just no concrete reason (as of yet) since none of the big boys want to reveal their hands.\n\n**Stock Market Crash**\n\nThe Stock Market has been reaching ATH's for the last few weeks and with the eviction moratorium ending, and possibly up to 11 million families at risk of losing their homes, there's a chance a crash is coming which may make 2008 look like peanuts in comparison. (MBS's anyone?)  *\"The last time this many families were behind on their mortgages was during the Great Recession.\" - CFPB*\n\nIn regards to this coming crash, it's possible that big investors are unwilling to risk putting more money into the market when they can rely on the government with their T-bonds. (Which also helps their margin requirements, so win-win for them.) I admit, this is pretty speculative and needs further research than what I'm willing to do right now.\n\n**Collateral Crisis**\n\nThere is some evidence that there is an actual shortage of Treasury bills within the market (dropping yields from their highs earlier this year) which could explain the Big Boys reliance on the FED and RRP. Oh, and the money printer himself, JPOW, said this, *\u201cYou could say there is a shortage of safe short assets\u2026 there\u2019s a shortage of T-bills\u201d*. So, yeah that's mildly concerning.\n\n**Short Positions**\n\nAnother reason as to the apparent need for bonds could be risky bets made by financial institutions (\"meme\" stocks anyone?) and the inevitability of short positions bankrupting them. I seriously doubt any of the big boys have closed most of their short positions yet so this is my personal theory.\n\nThere is also a chance that it's a combination of all three, none, or something else entirely that has yet to rear its ugly head.\n\n**TL;DR PT 2**\n\nThe point is; Reverse Repo's are a signal that the market is in risky shape due to unavoidable monetary policy decisions by the Fed (brought on by COVID) and Financial Institutions taking incredibly risky bets with other peoples' money. Time will tell what exactly caused this spike in Reverse Repo's but I'd hedge your bets whichever way you can.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Positions:** GME\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**References:**  Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Overnight Reverse Repurchase Agreements: Treasury Securities Sold by the Federal Reserve in the Temporary Open Market Operations \\[RRPONTSYD\\], retrieved from FRED, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis; [https:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/series\/RRPONTSYD](https:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/series\/RRPONTSYD), September 3, 2021.\n\nLewis Huxley.

Their financials are pretty terrible, their product is pretty bad and other than Chamath there\u2019s pretty much no institutions bag holding this stock. Is it just a GME\/AMC type thing where you guys are buying for no reason other than the name? \n\nGenuinely wondering how people rationalize holding CLOV.","83":"The mid-day update.

I'm sure you can find someone saying why \"CLOV should be $50 a share\" somewhere in the comments.\n* GME: You know the drill with this stock.\n* BABA: The little dipper that became the big dipper. BABA stock could be primed for a bounce after losing 40% value in just several months. WSB has done their anal(ysis) on this stock and are finally waiting for a trend to the upside.\n* SOFI: SoFi has just recently been minted as a favorite stock on WSB. Everyone is waiting for this ticker to get back to it's glory in the $20's, but so far has only been full of disappointment.\n* DOCU: Gaining popularity on WSB today since the stock is up 5%. Finally broke out of the $300 range and could potentially continue the run up (not financial advice).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/fbwr3azoebl71.png?width=2172&format=png&auto=webp&s=ddc474b5889e3fe26ec3e0b862b5c5c8688d91a5\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere are the rest of the top tickers being mentioned on WSB and some of  their current returns just before the close.

Welcome to today's edition of stocks that are giving the glizzy to the market.\n\nCLOV: The most mentioned ticker, mainly because the stock is green and bag-holders are uniting, hand in hand, praying it squeezes back to $30. CLOV mentions spiked right around noon as the stock price began to spike. I've included a chart so you can see the relation between mentions and stock price (hint they are very related).\n\nBABA: WSB has been screaming by the dip on BABA as one of the most under-valued stocks of all time. For what it's worth (literally useless info) I am also long BABA.\n\nSOFI: This stock is slowly becoming one of WSB's favorites. Not sure why, but my guess is the recent drop from $25 to $15 has some autistos buying the dip.\n\nGME: No need for an explanation on this one.\n\nSPCE: News about Virgin Galactic probe is affecting the stock price, now down 3%.

But I\u2019m gonna tell you about the real China play, one which sort of flies under the radar because it doesn\u2019t have the same prominence as BABA or PDD or DIDI. It\u2019s TIGR, or UP Fintech Holdings Limited. Known as \u2018the Robinhood of China\u2019, UP Fintech has a couple of significant differences to the platform we all love to hate (for one thing, they didn\u2019t prevent users from buying GME). Let\u2019s take a closer look.\n\n**1.** **What\u2019s UP, doc?**\n\nUP Fintech is a brokerage offering an app and a desktop client\/server platform. It\u2019s mainly focused on Chinese investors, but the occasional gweilo like me is welcome as a customer, too. Apparently, there are over a billion Chinese in China alone, and countless others all over the world. While listed on the Nasdaq since 2019 (at an initial offering of US8), the Cayman Islands domiciled UP Fintech holding company has operating entities in Asia (including China), Oceania (that\u2019s all the islands and nations surrounding the Eastern Pacific, including Hong Kong, Singapore, New Zealand, Australia, etc). The company was founded in Beijing in 2014 and has its HQ-proper, there.\n\n**2.** **The good: An excellent platform**\n\nTIGR\u2019s primary product is its trade platform, much ike Robinhood. TIGR\u2019s trading platform is called Tiger Trade and consists of an app as well as a desktop client\/server application, which work in concert. It provides options trading as well as the usual trading of stocks; unlike RH, TIGR offers access to global markets, so from a single app you can trade the Nasdaq, NYSE, OTCs, LSE, Hang Seng, the ASX, etc. This is a powerful feature as I am sure WSB degens will appreciate: why lose money for 8 hours a day when you can lose it around the clock!\n\nTiger Trade provides full access to markets, eg pre and post. Execution is excellent, the interface is very good on the app (although not quite RH good, particularly when it comes to options), and the platform is comprehensive, offering up to the minute charting, news, analysis, all SEC filings, company profiles and analyst price targets, in a single place. You get NYSE Arcabook standard and can buy additional data packages. It is gamified, like RH, incentivising trades and encouraging community engagement by awarding \u2018Tiger Tokens\u2019 for various actions, including making trades, as well as \u2018social\u2019 actions such as commenting, sharing positions, producing DDs, and so on. These tokens can be used to purchase various items including \u2018Commission-free trade cards\u2019.\n\nWhich brings us to another matter \u2013 the cost of trading on Tiger. Signup is free (in my country, NZ, at least \u2013 I don\u2019t know if this is the case elsewhere). Typically, a trade will cost you .99c US, no matter the value of the trade. You can\u2019t trade fractional shares. Tiger Trade also supports short selling for the brave or really foolish (like me).\n\n**3.** **The bad: It\u2019s an ADR. And some other stuff.**\n\nProbably the biggest risk I see with TIGR is its status as an ADR. While TIGR hasn\u2019t \u2018enjoyed\u2019 the scrutiny of the CCCP which has befallen BABA, BIDU, VIPS and especially the edus the tickers of which can no longer be mentioned on WSB, it is nevertheless joined at the hip with other Chinese ADRs. This means whether or not the CCCP has a blowtorch on TIGR specifically, it is subject to the same vagaries of a dictatorial party, ie there is political risk either directly or by association. This has, I think, underpinned recent volatility in the stock, which tends to move in lockstep with the other ADRs\u2026China stocks up, TIGR stock up, and vice versa. It\u2019s a China stock, what can I say.\n\nThere was also the issue, so to speak, of a share issue in June, where a further 6.5 million ADRs were issued. In a statement, the company said the proceeds are to go towards (i) expanding its customer base and driving customer engagement with its services, (ii) investing in expanding its products, services and technologies to enhance its user experience and operating efficiency, and (iii) expanding its international presence. Issues are never good for existing holders, but at least TIGR didn\u2019t include the \u2018general corporate purposes\u2019 which invariably means \u2018We need the money for rent and salaries\u2019. The other thing is that the offering is complete, so there shouldn\u2019t hopefully be any further dilution on the cards for now.\n\n**4.** **The pretty: A growth story**\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at some numbers. The company is currently valued at around 2.4 billion and has around 800 employees (compare with RH with a valuation north of 16b, and around 1300 employees).\n\nAt the last quarter, TIGR published the following results:\n\n\u00b7 Total revenues increased 255.5% year-over-year to US$81.3 million.\n\n\u00b7 Total net revenues increased 245.7% year-over-year to US$75.7 million.\n\n\u00b7 Net income increased to US$21.1 million from net loss of US$0.5 million in the same quarter of last year.\n\n\u00b7 Net income attributable to UP Fintech increased to US$21.1 million from net loss of US$0.2 million in the same quarter of last year.\n\n\u00b7 Non-GAAP net income attributable to UP Fintech increased to US$23.5 million, compared to US$1.1 million in the same quarter of last year. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial metrics to the most comparable GAAP metrics is set forth below.\n\n\u00b7 Operating Highlights for First Quarter 2021\n\n\u00b7 Total account balance increased 289.8% year-over-year to US$21.4 billion.\n\n\u00b7 Total margin financing and securities lending balance increased 177.3% year-over-year to US$2.3 billion.\n\n\u00b7 Total number of customers **with deposits** increased 180.4% year-over-year to 376.0K.\n\nRight now, TIGR is trading at a PE of about 52. There\u2019s plenty of volume, with around 10 mil per day, so liquidity isn\u2019t an issue.\n\nAfter the publication of these results in May, the share price shot through the roof, going from around 17 to around 28 in a little over two weeks.\n\n**5.** **Upcoming earnings**\n\nTIGR reports on 10 September (pre). Given the rapid expansion of its customer numbers in the preceding quarter, and given the growing interest in easy-to-use, affordable trading platforms not only in the USA but everywhere (and the Chinese are everywhere, along with compliant gweilos like myself), I fully expect the customer growth numbers to shoot out the lights. That share issue described above may even prove a major catalyst in driving customer growth, after all, they completed the offering fast and have the money, let\u2019s see how well they have invested it.\n\nMy expectation for earnings is a big boost in the share price. Right now, with the Chinese ADRs experiencing something of a comeback, I have a price target of at least $24. That\u2019s solid upside from the current SP of around 13.70.\n\n**Position:**\n\n6982 shares at 14.56. Looking for any dips below 13 to add more. Considering buying some calls for the week after earnings, but a noob when it comes to options trading.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT TO ADD: 5 analysts rate Up Fintech ADR with an average target price of 29.68; low of 21.06 and high of 38.67.

I'm sure you guys have seen the meme stocks going up the last few days, or since Aug 24th. Since missing some of the last one, I have decided I will not let that happen again. After some quick late night DD, I think it is time to go back to an old WSB favorite. I have loaded up on deep out-of-the-money BBBY FDs..\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Comparison to Last Meme Cycles:**\n\nI'm sure some of you have seen the theories as to why these spikes happen on certain dates. Whether or not any of those are true, I do believe we are entering the third meme cycle looking at the dates. If last meme cycles were any indicator, GME \/ AMC lead the pack and the rest follow. New memes are born and old ones comeback. For me, the smartest way to play this is through the stocks that follow. GME and AMC calls are already jacked to the tits for me to feel comfortable buying. However, I still want exposure to this meme cycle. I'm looking for stocks that move with the memes that also have low IV\/ cheap options.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**BBBY:**\n\n-This is where BBBY comes in:\n\n* 24% SI of the free float according to Ortex. Up 6% ( https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/fIBA9GR ) \n* Around the same as last huge squeeze to $53.90 ( https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/u1XEukn ) \n* Options are incredibly cheap compared to most other meme stocks. \n* Has been slowly ramping up. Moved very similarly to the other memes last time. \n* Old WSB Favorite (This Bald headed bastard loves it too) Me too Cramer! - https:\/\/twitter.com\/search?f=live&pf=on&q=BBBY%20(from%3Ajimcramer)&src=typed_query\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Fundamentals:** \n\nAll I have for fundamentals is from my \"value investing friend\" who had a 2.0 GPA as a finance major. He says that it is \"criminally undervalued\". I'm gonna take his word for it, but this is not the purpose of this trade. Others could probably make a better bull\/ bear case on the fundamentals.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Plan:**\n\nI'm sure this trade is obvious to many of you. This is really for people who are too retarded to realize that other stocks move with GME \/ AMC. There are probably other similar picks that may do well too, but I like this one the best. My plan is to reload on FDs every week until September 17th. I am not planning to gamble my entire account this is just my best pick for exposure to it. If the price goes anywhere from 40-50, these calls are some ridiculous times my money right now.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**TLDR:**\n \nIf GME \/ AMC go up - BBBY goes up. If it squeezes anywhere near where it did last time\/ unbelievable tendies will be made.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Positions:** 34c (Sept 3rd) 71 Contracts\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**PS:** Not financial Advisor\/ Financial Advice.

This means that, for example, you can now bet on SPY being either over or under $450 by a certain date without worrying about how far over $450 or how far under $450 it actually goes. Or similarly you can also bet that say GME will finish this week either over or under $250. If the options expire worthless (sound familiar), you actually win! It's basically like betting on an over\/under in sports.\n\n# How it works\n\nTo open a credit spreads you simply sell a put\/call and buy the put\/call either below it (for puts) or above it (for calls). **YOU WIN IF BOTH OPTIONS EXPIRE WORTHLESS.** Since the put or call you sell is more expensive than the one you buy, you are collecting credit. This means that a **call credit spread is a bearish** position and a **put credit spread is a bullish position.**\n\n# Example with visuals\n\nI want to bet that SPY will be below $450 by EOW. To do this I sell the $450 call expiring on 8\/27 and then buy the $451 call (the strike right above it).\n\nThe $450 call is worth $0.68 (which I get) and the $451 call is worth $0.38 (which I pay to buy). The difference between these values is 0.68 - 0.38 = 0.30 which I get to keep.\n\nMAX PROFIT IF SPY FINISHES UNDER $450 AND BOTH OPTIONS EXPIRE WORTHLESS: $30 (0.30 x 100) for each contract.\n\nMAX LOSS IF SPY FINISHES ABOVE $451: $1 (distance between the strikes) - $0.30 = $0.70 so $70 after multiplying by 100.\n\nPROFIT LOSS GRAPH:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/41xkdjb51jj71.png?width=448&format=png&auto=webp&s=36ddca7c3613121408ad4f3e853ab245ab47af92\n\nAs you can see on the 27th if SPY finishes under $450 you make your max profit and if it finishes above $451 you trigger your max loss.\n\n# RISKS\n\n**Always close your spreads before market close even if it seems like both options will expire worthless. This is because if SPY closes at $449.5 (you think you make your max profit), but then decides to gap up in after hours to $450.5 the call you sold ($450) is now ITM but the call you bought to ensure you're not selling just a naked call ($451) is still OTM.** This opens you up to expiration\/pin risk which can make your max loss larger than displayed above. This is not a problem if you simply close the spread before close and some brokers will automatically do this for you.\n\n# You can even do 0dte challenges!\n\nIt's Friday and SPY is at $449 but you have a gut feeling that it won't go below $449 so you sell a 0dte $449 put and buy the $448 put. If by EOD SPY is above $449 then you win!\n\n# TLDR:\n\nYou want to bet that SPY will be under $450 by EOW so you sell a $450 call and buy a $451 call. If SPY finishes under $450 you win and if it goes above you lose. You can do this with any ticker (betting that GME will finish above\/under $250 or that AMC will finish above\/under $50 by EOW).\n\nFeel free to ask questions below.","94":"IV, IV Rank, Realized and Historical - A Primer on Volatility Hello idiots,\n\nMost option strategies involve trading volatility in one way or another. It\u2019s easy to think of trading in terms of direction. But trading volatility? Volatility is an abstract concept; it has often nothing to do with the stock price. I've seen many of you ask questions of the sort: \n\nStock go up after earnings but call go down, hedgies bad. Or,\n\nStock go up, but put go up as well, I need to exploit this glitch.\n\nI will try to shed some light on some of these topics. The first step to understand when buying options is that you profit from volatility going up.\n\nYes, you heard me correctly, you might not know it but when you buy FDs such as GME 1000C you are effectively long vega or long volatility. Yeah that's sounds fancy, I'm sure you'll impress your grandma with that at Christmas. She might even lend you some money so you can \"invest it\". \n\nMany traders trade without a solid understanding of volatility and its effect on option prices. These traders are often unhappily surprised when volatility moves against them. They mistake the adverse option price movements that result from volatility for getting ripped off by the market makers or some other market voodoo. \n\nThe term volatility can have a few different meanings in the options business. There are three different uses of the word volatility that an option trader must be concerned with: historical volatility, implied volatility, and expected volatility. Let's dive in!\n\n \n\n**Implied volatility** is the expected magnitude of a stock's future price changes, as\u00a0*implied*\u00a0by the stock's option prices. Implied volatility is represented as an annualized percentage. It's important to note that IV is extracted from the options price and is thus determined by supply and demiand\n\nConsider the following stocks and their respective option prices (options with 37 days to expiration):\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/q3rfkxs5eij71.png?width=573&format=png&auto=webp&s=052b34e0d2090bc84452e4241b890494ac540771\n\nAs we can see, both stocks are nearly\u00a0the same price. However, the same options on each stock have different prices. In the case of TCOM, the call and put prices are much higher than ELY's options, which translates to an implied volatility that is higher than ELY So, instead of looking at option prices all day long, options traders use implied volatility to quickly compare the expected price movements (and therefore, the option prices)\u00a0of various stocks. In this case, there's only a 10 percentage point difference between the two, yet the differences are huge.\n\n**Why is this the case**\n\nWhen market participants trade options, they typically do it for one of two reasons:\n\n**1)** To speculate on movements in the stock price or the stock's option prices (implied volatility).\n\n**2)** To hedge the risk of an existing position against changes in the stock price.\n\nIf market participants are willing to pay a high price for options, then that *implies*\u00a0they are\u00a0expecting significant movements in the stock price or implied volatility.\u00a0\n\nConversely, if market participants aren't willing to pay much for options, then that implies the market is not expecting significant stock price movements.\n\nSince implied volatility represents the overall level of a stock's option prices, **implied volatility is just a way to describe the market's expectations for future stock price movements**. The higher the implied volatility, the larger the expected range of moves. This is why IV increases before earnings and crashes after.\n\nAlright, this is the basics, now let's see some other concepts and dig deeper into IV.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Historical Volatility** \n\nImagine there are two stocks: Stock A and Stock B. Both are trading at around $100 a share. Over the past month, a typical end-of-day net change in the price of Stock A has been up or down $5 to $7. During that same period, a typical daily move in Stock B has been something more like up or down $1 or $2. Stock A has tended to move more than Stock B as a percentage of its price, without regard to direction. \n\nTherefore, Stock A is more volatile than Stock B. Thus, Stock A has a higher historical volatility than Stock B. Historical volatility (HV) is the annualized standard deviation of daily returns. Also called realized volatility, statistical volatility, or stock volatility.\n\nHV is a measure of how volatile the price movement of a security has been during a certain period of time. But exactly how much higher is Stock A\u2019s HV than Stock B\u2019s? In order to objectively compare the volatilities of two stocks, historical volatility must be quantified. HV relates this volatility information in an objective numerical form. The volatility of a stock is expressed in terms of standard deviation. \n\n**Standard Deviation** \n\nAlthough knowing the mathematical formula behind standard deviation is not entirely necessary, understanding the concept is essential. Standard deviation, sometimes represented by the Greek letter sigma, is a mathematical calculation that measures the dispersion of data from a mean value. In this case, the mean is the average stock price over a certain period of time. The farther from the mean the dispersion of occurrences (data) was during the period, the greater the standard deviation. Occurrences, in this context, are usually the closing prices of the stock. For the purpose of illustrating standard deviation, a normal distribution is used here. When the graph of data adheres to a normal distribution, the result is a symmetrical bell-shaped curve. Standard deviation can be shown on the bell curve to either side of the mean. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/cfmxuy3u0hj71.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a760961ee1dc11aef8599c2fe5b0a5259c3261c\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn the right vertical axis, you can see the number of occurences, on the horinzontal axis, you can see the daily return. The higher the curve, the more likely we are to see that return. For example, for stocks you are most likley to see returns around 0. This is why the curve is highest around 0.\n\nEvents that cause big changes in the price of a stock, like a company\u2019s being acquired by another or discovering its chief financial officer cooking the books, are not a daily occurrence. Comparatively smaller price fluctuations that reflect less extreme changes in the value of the corporation are more typically seen day to day. Statistically, the most probable outcome for a price change is found around the midpoint of the curve. \n\nAbout 68 percent of all occurrences will take place between up one standard deviation and down one standard deviation. Two- and three-standard-deviation values could be shown on the curve as well. About 95 percent of data occur between up and down two standard deviations and about 99.7 percent between up and down three standard deviations. One standard deviation is the relevant figure in determining historical volatility. \n\n**Standard Deviation and Historical Volatility**\n\n When standard deviation is used in the context of historical volatility, it is annualized to state what the one-year volatility would be. Historical volatility is the annualized standard deviation of daily returns. This means that if a stock is trading at $100 a share and its historical volatility is 10 percent, then about 68 percent of the occurrences (closing prices) are expected to fall between $90 and $110 during a one-year period (based on recent past performance). Simply put, historical volatility shows how volatile a stock has been based on price movements that have occurred in the past. Although option traders may study HV to make informed decisions as to the value of options traded on a stock, it is not a direct function of option prices. For this, we must look to implied volatility. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**IV rank and IV percentile**\n\nEven though most of you degenerates first think about philosophy when you hear about the greeks, it's highly likely you've already heard of Implied Volatility Rank (IV Rank). \u00a0\n\nIf you've got one or two brain wrinkles you might even have heard about IV Percentile. We're going to highlight the difference between the two, which may help you lose less money in the future, or at least do it professionally\n\nIV Rank is one of the more popular volatility trading metrics, and is relatively easy to understand. \u00a0IV Rank tells us whether implied volatility is high or low in a specific underlying relative to the past year of implied volatility data.\n\nFor example, imagine that implied volatility has ranged between 30 and 60 for underlying XYZ over the past year. If implied volatility is currently trading at 45, then the IV Rank for XYZ would be 50% - exactly in the middle of its one-year historical range.\n\nIf implied volatility was 60 in XYZ, then its IV Rank would be 100%. It literally is that simple:\n\nIV of stock is low during the year, IV is high now -> IV Rank will be high. \n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/2c7ogn175hj71.png?width=793&format=png&auto=webp&s=f479426013e6107d000a631f4c41ef8eb3a5f016\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow let's take a look at Implied Volatility Percentile (IV Percentile).\n\nNotably, IV Percentile doesn't specifically take into account the high and low in implied volatility over the past year.\n\nInstead, IV Percentile represents the percentage of days that implied volatility has traded below the current level over the past year. For example, if IV Percentile is 5% in XYZ, that would mean that implied volatility only traded below current levels 5% of the time over the course of the previous 12 months.\n\nOn the other hand, if IV Percentile in XYZ is 80%, that would mean that implied volatility had traded below current levels 80% of the time over the previous 12 months.\n\nThe slide below, also from Trading with Katie, depicts graphically another example where IV Percentile is 21%. That means that 79% of the time, implied volatility was higher than current levels.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/y21mon3a5hj71.png?width=795&format=png&auto=webp&s=b0fef4324e129f619946d54f111ec0da049bc992\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you're interest I could go deeper and try to cover implied ranges or how to calulate what moves are expected in a stock given an IV. Send me a message, and I'll see what I can do.\n\nIn the mean time, please don't YOLO your mom's savings in some degenerate FD just because, \"I'm so cool, I'm long Vega\". I have little hope, but do send me a picture of your lambo when you make bank.\n\n**TLDR: Volatility is important and easy to understand, go read.

Introduction\n\nI think the **hardest part about trading is that the market is constantly evolving**. We are creatures of habit, as a result we get complacent and think we can find a single, comfortable strategy that works an infinite amount of times. This is almost never the case; different market conditions call for different approaches. By combining this post with my last, you should **obtain a basic understanding of how you can read market conditions, and adapt with the market.**\n\nIf you [read my previous post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/p1x0ls\/follow_the_money_how_to_catch_every_rotation_and\/), you now know when money is flowing into equities, and when it is flowing into bonds, the dollar and other safe havens. You also know about the different indexes, and what basket of stocks they carry. You even know about some interesting correlations that have arisen recently related to tech and a risk off rotation.\n\nIn this one - I'm going to take it a step further, and dig a little deeper, showing you all how to tell exactly which types equities money is flowing to, and **how to use that to generate high probability trades.** In this era of passive indexation, **you are almost never just buying one stock**. You are buying one stock - and every stock correlated to it. That means, **when you are buying CLOV and PLTR - you are also buying WISH, BB, AMC, UWMC and GME.** This obviously is not a category of stocks by traditional means - but in recent times it has become one. The point is - **you are going all in on one stock and you don't even realize it.**\n\nTo avoid this phenomenon - you need to understand the different different industries present within the market. Equities all belong to at least one of these - **and will usually track the rest of the stocks within their respective industry quite closely.**\n\n# II. The Eleven Sectors That Define The Market\n\nThere is generally believed to be eleven different sectors that equities belong to. In this section, I'll detail what each one is, **the ETF you can use to track it**, and what environment it usually outperforms in.\n\nAlso, there's two main categories for stocks: **cyclicals - which follow the business cycle, and non-cyclicals - which perform the same year round.**\n\n# 1 - Energy (VDE)\n\n**What It Is -**\n\n\"The energy sector is a category of stocks that relate to producing or supplying energy. The energy sector or industry includes companies involved in the exploration and development of oil or gas reserves, oil and gas drilling, and refining. The energy industry also includes integrated power utility companies such as renewable energy and coal.\"\n\n\\- *Investopedia*\n\nBasically, this sector is dominated by the oil industry. You will notice renewables will hardly effect it's price movements a vast majority of the time. While many are trying to shift away from oil, it will likely be a massive part of our economy and our market long into the future.\n\n**When It Outperforms -**\n\nIn most situations - the energy sector is cyclical. This means when our economy is doing well and expanding - it will perform well.  When it isn't, the reverse is true. Because it is dominated by a commodity, energy companies also have no issue passing on inflation to their consumers. However, keep in mind this one is a bit special because of OPEC and their ability to influence price.\n\n\"OPEC is a cartel that **aims to manage the supply of oil** in an effort to set the price of oil on the world market, in order to avoid fluctuations that might affect the economies of both producing and purchasing countries.\"\n\n*- Investopedia*\n\nBasically, they have most of the oil, and fix the prices to their liking. This can have some unforeseen effects on the market, so if you are trading energy you definitely want to monitor their movements.\n\n# 2 - Materials (VAW)\n\n**What It Is -**\n\n\"The basic materials sector is an industry category made up of businesses engaged in the discovery, development, and processing of raw materials. The sector includes companies engaged in mining and metal refining, chemical products,\u00a0and forestry products.\"\n\n\\- *Investopedia*\n\n**When It Outperforms -**\n\nThe materials sector is cyclical. It is sensitive to changes in the economy and tracks it pretty closely. This is another sector that can easily pass inflation onto their consumers due to the nature of their products. It's also going to be especially sensitive to any changes in the supply and demand of raw materials worldwide.\n\n# 3 - Industrials (VIS)\n\n**What It Is -**\n\n\"The industrial goods sector includes stocks of companies that mainly produce capital goods used in manufacturing, resource extraction, and construction. Businesses in the industrial goods sector make and sell machinery, equipment, and supplies that are used to produce other goods rather than sold directly to consumers.\"\n\n\\- *Investopedia*\n\nBasically, the materials sector passes raw materials to the industrials sector - which converts them to products used to manufacture the final products passed on to consumers.\n\n**When It Outperforms -**\n\nBecause it is so closely tied to how much companies are producing - this sector is also cyclical. This is yet another sector that can pass the costs of inflation onto their consumers. Subsequently, due to it's close ties with the materials sector - it will be especially sensitive to the supply and demand of raw materials.\n\n# 4 - Consumer Discretionary (VCR)\n\n**What It Is -**\n\n\"Consumer discretionary is a term for classifying goods and services that are considered non-essential by consumers, but desirable if their available income is sufficient to purchase them. Examples of consumer discretionary products can include durable goods, high-end apparel, entertainment, leisure activities, and automobiles.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\\- *Investopedia*\n\nEssentially, anything broke people can't afford, like those who went all in on WISH calls before earnings, goes in this basket.\n\n**When It Outperforms -**\n\nBecause it depends on the income of consumers - this is also a cyclical sector. When the economy is thriving, people will have more money to blow on non-essential goods, like $120 Lululemon shorts, or tickets to Disney World.\n\n# 5 -  Consumer Staples (VDC)\n\n**What It Is -**\n\n\"The term consumer staples refers to a set of essential products used by consumers. This category includes things like foods and beverages, household goods, and hygiene products as well as alcohol and tobacco. These goods are those products that people are unable\u2014or unwilling\u2014to cut out of their budgets regardless of their financial situation.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\\- *Investopedia*\n\nBasically the opposite of consumer discretionary - these are things people **NEED** not things that they **WANT.**\n\n**When It Outperforms -**\n\nThese are non-cyclical, or defensive - which means regardless of how the economy is doing they will perform more or less the same. This means when the economy is taking a turn for the worst, they will generally outperform the other sectors. This doesn't mean they are immune to business cycle changes entirely, but they are certainly much less affected by them.\n\n# 6 - Health Care (VHT)\n\n**What It Is -**\n\n\"The healthcare sector consists of businesses that provide medical services, manufacture medical equipment or drugs, provide medical insurance, or otherwise facilitate the provision of healthcare to patients. The healthcare sector is one of the largest and most complex in the U.S. economy, accounting for close to a fifth of overall gross domestic product (GDP). The U.S. healthcare sector benefits from a strong system of medical research and development, in cooperation with the higher education system and the technology industry. The aging U.S. population and the advancing senescence of the Baby Boomer generation are driving ongoing strong demand in the healthcare sector.\"\n\n\\- *Investopedia*\n\n**When It Outperforms -**\n\nThis one is a bit complicated because there are a few industries within the sector, namely: medical equipment, drug R&D, and health insurance. The sector is non-cyclical - but each industry has it's own quirks.\n\nThe drug industry in particular often moves independently of everything else on the market, because it is highly dependent on new developments and news pieces related to potentially groundbreaking treatments. Health insurance and medical equipment is usually non-negotiable regardless of the business cycle - so it will outperform in times of economic distress, and generally perform the same year round.\n\n# 7 - Financials (VFH)\n\n**What It Is -**\n\n\"The financial sector is a section of the economy\u00a0made up of\u00a0firms and institutions that provide financial services to commercial and retail customers. This\u00a0sector comprises a broad range of industries including banks, investment companies, insurance companies, and real estate firms.\"\n\n\\- *Investopedia*\n\n**When It Outperforms -**\n\nBanks involve the supply and demand of money. They make money through fees and interest rate spreads. Banks perform well during economic expansion when companies and individuals are borrowing money. One of the main drivers of borrowing\/lending is interest rates. In a rising rate environment (observed through TNX, TLT, US treasury yield curve), banks will outperform. They pay short term rates (front of curve) on their deposits, and lend money to companies or individuals at a higher interest rate (further out on the curve) capturing a difference or \"spread\" on interest paid vs received. Understanding treasury yields and how they are related to the daily price movements in the financial sector is a great place to start.\n\n# 8 - Information Technology (VGT)\n\n**What It Is -**\n\n\"The technology sector is the category of stocks relating to the research, development, or distribution of technologically based goods and services. This sector contains businesses revolving around the manufacturing of electronics, creation of software, computers, or products and services relating to information technology.\"\n\n\\- *Investopedia*\n\nThis one really needs no introduction.\n\n**When It Outperforms -**\n\nThis is a bit tricky due to some correlations that have arisen from 2020 onward. For most of history - most tech stocks were cyclical. However, due to COVID, extremely low interest rates, and some other factors - these assets are now being rotated into during a risk off environment - and are seen as a safe-haven. Who knows if this will stand, but it's important to understanding when money will flow there **today.** More on this can be found in my previous post, where I go into detail on this phenomenon.\n\n# 9 - Communication Services (VOX)\n\n**What It Is -**\n\n\"The telecommunication sector is made up of companies that make communication possible on a global scale, whether it is through the phone or the Internet, through airwaves or cables, through wires or wirelessly. These companies created the infrastructure that allows data in words, voice, audio, or video to be sent anywhere in the world. The largest companies in the sector are telephone (both wired and wireless) operators, satellite companies, cable companies, and Internet service providers.\"\n\n\\- *Investopedia*\n\n**When It Outperforms -**\n\nThis is another non-cyclical sector. Whether the economy is good or bad - people aren't going to give up communicating with each other. In today's world, everyone needs a phone - even if it's a flip phone - and everyone needs internet access. One of the interesting parts of this sectors is that it is comprised of both growth names and income names. While the larger names are more consistent with dividends, the smaller names often have more room for capital appreciation and earnings growth.\n\n# 10 - Utilities (VPU)\n\n**What It Is -**\n\n\"The utilities sector refers to a category of companies that provide basic amenities, such as water, sewage services, electricity, dams, and natural gas. It is a large sector, and an important part of the U.S. economy, with a market capitalization of over $1.5 trillion (as of March 2021). Although utilities are private, for-profit companies, they are part of the public service landscape\u2014providing as they do such staples for daily living\u2014and are therefore heavily regulated. Investors typically treat utilities as long-term holdings and use them to generate a steady income for their portfolios.\"\n\n\\- *Investopedia*\n\n**When It Outperforms -**\n\nYet another non-cyclical basket of stocks. Regardless of the business cycle, demand for utilities almost always remains constant. These are some of the most stable stocks on the market - so WSB is probably better going to forget they exist moments after reading this post.\n\n# 11 - Real Estate (VNQ)\n\n**What It Is -**\n\n\"Real estate is the land along with any permanent improvements attached to the land, whether natural or man-made\u2014including water, trees, minerals, buildings, homes, fences, and bridges. Real estate is a form of real property. It differs from personal property, which are things not permanently attached to the land, such as vehicles, boats, jewelry, furniture, and farm equipment.\"\n\n*- Investopedia*\n\n**When It Outperforms -**\n\nLike most industries, real estate involves the supply and demand of property, both residential and commercial. Real Estate is closely related to changes in construction or development, but also heavily influenced by interest rates. Most participants are using Loan to Value (LTV), anywhere from 60-85% of the total property value; therefore, interest rate changes will impact participants' ability to borrow. Thinking through these variables, its safe to assume that real estate performs well in low interest rate environments, low-moderate commodity prices for construction, population growth, and government (both local and federal) infrastructure support. When rates rise, the debt burden increases and money is hard to borrow; which ultimately affect the ability to invest in new projects or purchase homes.\n\n# III. Practical Applications\n\nTo use all of this information - and convert it to probabilities I can use to trade - **I perform technical analysis on each sector ETF using the 1 year 1 day chart (swing trade timeframe)**. If one is breaking out of a large setup - I can assume money is going to move there in the future. If others are forming nice setups - I know to add them to my watchlist.\n\nAfter identifying a sector that is likely to become strong in the near future - **I then filter it further by finding particular stocks within the sector that have similar setups**. I usually look through the top holdings of the ETF pertaining to the sector. I do this because individual stocks are more volatile than sector ETFs and more liquid - which means there is more money to be made. If a particular stock is lagging behind the sector, it can also mean there is even more to gain than in the case of another name.\n\nYou can take this one step further and combine information from my previous posts by identifying whether we are risk on, or risk off. Cyclicals are generally going to outperform while we are risk on. Non-cyclicals will generally outperform while we are risk off.\n\n**Example -**\n\nLast week - I noticed financials were breaking out of a large falling wedge on the daily chart. This has a bullish bias - and indicates price will make a strong move in the near future. I didn't have to scan the ETF for this one, since all the stocks in it are household names.\n\n[VFH \\(Financials\\) 1 Year 1 Day](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/f8lboux5r5h71.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d82ab4b17cc79ada84ec6e65473fd1eac870309)\n\nI also noticed BAC had formed a bull flag. This was all the information I needed to enter some October Calls which I closed today for a nice profit.\n\n[BAC \\(Financials\\) 1 Year 1 Day](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/fjfynyv7r5h71.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=67e0cb7ec1e5d05729cf3e41382c8591662a896e)\n\nLastly, ZB was trending downwards and yields were rising. This was an environment banks outperform in - which means it enforced my probability of success even more.\n\n[ZB \\(Bonds\\) 1 Year 1 Day](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/6wwok3sbr5h71.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=596609c73c6bbfdfc01392c6262a9bb8044cb204)\n\nYou don't have to use technical analysis. This is just my preference. Many people use complex fundamental and economic analysis to determine these rotations. The important thing is understanding the environments particular sectors will outperform in.\n\n# IV. Closing Thoughts\n\nLet me first apologize for the wall of text. I'll do my best to summarize it for those with short attention spans in my TL;DR.\n\nIf you got through all of this, and my last post - hopefully you have a better understanding of tracking where money is going, and using that to make higher quality trades. I think this is a topic most of WSB doesn't know exists (or doesn't believe in) which causes them to lose lots of money because they are all in on meme stocks, and meme stocks haven't been in the rotation for a little while. That's not to say they won't ever be again - but for the time being the broader market has made all time highs almost daily whilst these names continue to puke their guts out.\n\n# V. TL;DR\n\nThere's **11 sectors** within the stock market.\n\nThey are:\n\n1. Energy **(VDE, Cyclical)**\n2. Materials **(VAW, Cyclical)**\n3. Industrials **(VIS, Cyclical)**\n4. Consumer Discretionary **(VCR, Cyclical)**\n5. Consumer Staples **(VDC, Non-Cyclical)**\n6. Healthcare **(VHT, Non-Cyclical)**\n7. Financials **(VFH, Cyclical)**\n8. Information Technology **(VGT, Cyclical Most Of The Time)**\n9. Communication Services **(VOX, Non-Cyclical)**\n10. Utilities **(VPU, Non-Cyclical)**\n11. Real Estate **(VNQ, Cyclical)**\n\nEach one will be rotated into depending on different market conditions. Understanding this is important to being able to make money at any given time. I perform technical analysis to determine when each is being rotated into, but you can use any analysis you want.","105":"CLOV\ud83c\udf40 you Irish fucks \u201cAugust 12, 2021 10:57 AM ET (BZ Newswire) -- Long Ideas\n\nClover Health (NASDAQ:CLOV) is under r\/WallStreetBets\u2019 spotlight again after printing second-quarter earnings. The Medicare advantage provider reported a whopping $412 million in revenue, more than double the consensus estimate of $205.4 million.\n\nClover was soaring 20% toward the $10 mark early Thursday morning. Although Clover respectably printed a blowout quarter, and the share price could go much higher due to that, the stock also has bizarre characteristics that have helped to make it a short squeeze candidate in the past.\n\nBetween June 7 to July 9 Clover Health soared about 205% from $9.35 to an all-time high of $28.85. Like GameStop Corporation (NYSE:GME) back in January, Clover\u2019s underlying statistics appeal to retail traders looking to squeeze short sellers:\n\nSmall Float: Clover has a relatively small float of just 112.38 million shares.\nOwnership Levels: Clover has an unbelievable 119.64% of its float tied up in the hands of insiders and institutions with 95.06% of its shares held by institutions and 24.58% by insiders.\nShort Interest: 25.26 million shares, meaning 22.47% of its total float, is held short although this number has dropped from 35.89 million in June.\nSee Also: How to Buy Clover Health Stock\n\nThe Clover Health Chart: After Clover\u2019s parabolic run in June the stock sold off over 72% and found a bottom at the $7.84 mark. For the past 20 trading days, Clover has held above the level and traded in a tight sideways pattern under $8.99.\n\nThere has been low volume in Clover\u2019s stock during the sideways trading, indicating a lack of both sellers and buyers. Often when a security\u2019s volume drops off for an extended period of time, either huge bearish or bullish volume comes in to break it from the sideways pattern.\n\nClover closed Wednesday just below the eight-day and 21-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) with the eight-day EMA trending below the 21-day, which is bearish. If Clover trades above the $8.70 area on Thursday it will be above both commonly followed EMAs and the short-term sentiment will be bullish.\n\nThe 200-day simple moving average (SMA), which is a tool used to measure overall sentiment in a stock, is at about the $10.50 area. If Clover trades below the SMA, overall sentiment is bearish; if the stock is able to clear the level, the sentiment will shift to bullish.\u201d \n\n\nIn other words. CLOV to fucking space.

This is  an entertainment\/comedy-nonfactual post. I'm a retard  posting on WSB  with a bias due to having a very large position of my portfolio in $F.  So, Don't act on anything posted in here and proceed on your own risk...)\n\n**1- Ford's secret weapon unleashed:**\n\nFor the last **44 consecutive years**, the F-150 has been Americas **best selling Truck**. In 2019, the Ford F-Series was **second only to the Apple iPhone**, which  raked in **$55 billion**, in terms of **total revenue** generated. The F-Series **generated more revenue than the NFL, MLB, NBA, and the NHL combined**, Just something to think about.\n\nOn May 19, Ford has unveiled its EV F-150 after Biden had driven it a week prior. The EV's features are mind blowing exceeding all expectations (Watch MKBHD review or Fords 5 min ad video). It has all the features crucial for it's **target buyers** (Construction workers, Farmers, Free-lance delivery drivers, Basically hardworking Blue-collar Americans...) and it's **a Truck which actually looks like a Truck.** \u201cFord knows what pickup owners want,\u201d IHS Markit senior analyst Stephanie Brinley said. More importantly, it's an F-150 first, an EV second, Ford didn't abandon the F-150 core design which has been successful for 44 consecutive years.\n\nThe reservation now have exceeded 120,000 since it's debut. An important point the CEO mentioned on the call was that **about 75%, or 90,000, are new to Ford, according to the company!** If anything, this indicates that Ford is the runner up for Tesla in the EV competition. almost every car manufacturer can make an EV, but only a few (I can count on one hand) can supply enough cars to keep up with demand with superb price and quality.\n\nNow Ford's EVs are targeting middle class value buyers (High quality, cheap EVs to compete with TESLA and they are destroying Tesla for the past 4 months with sales, more on this on #5). The F-150 starts at  $32,500 after Federal tax credit!! Cheaper than any of **\"Potential(because they don't exist yet)\"** competitors with superior car features.\n\nIt's relevant to mention that Ford's EV sales (counting electric vehicles and hybrids) increased 177% during June, capping off 56,570 units sold so far in 2021.\n\n**As Ford promised, F-150 Lightning will deliver more features, and cost less...**\n\n^(Don't forget about potential upcoming Ford SUVs, and a Bronco EV which might be announced this year.)\n\n**2- Ford Rivian Partnership:**\n\nFord-Backed EV Automaker Rivian is planning to IPO as soon as September. It's looking for a valuation of 70Billion which is valued more than Ford Right now \ud83d\ude02(Ford is 55.64B at 14.18$). Ford has initially invested 500$ million in Rivian, but it added much more of an undisclosed amount with **the most recent news being 902$million in Q1 of 2021.**\n\n**On Jul 23, it was announced that Rivian closed a $2.5 billion funding round,** led by existing investors **Ford**, Amazon and T. Prior to it, they announced plans to open a second manufacturing plant and U.S States started submitting bids on it.\n\nFarley is quick to say Ford did not invest in the Michigan startup to make money in the stock market. **As more companies continue to invest in Rivian, Ford benefits from the increased value of its shares,** \"but that's not why we invested,\" Farley said in an interview with MotorTrend.\n\nFarley with his 3D chess moves is probably investing in it to make a move to dominate the EV-SUV market too **with a Lincoln or Explorer-Rivian car**. He understands that **the first move is the most important one in the EV Game,** and with the Mach-E and F-150, Ford executed it's moves perfectly! Farley wants to take as much of the market share as possible with low prices, high quality, while maintaining the demand(something which Tesla still isn't able to). Ford can do that due to their international factories and cheap oversees labor mentioned in Part 1.3\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3- Bronco capturing Buyers of other brands:**\n\nPrior to the release of the Bronco, it had 190,000 reservations. **66% of the reservations were converted to sales!** Additionally, Farley mentioned in the earnings call that 70% of the 125,000 orders it has are customers of other brands.\n\nAccording to Ford, dealers are keeping Broncos on the lot for an average of **15 days!,** with a big chunk of of the buyers coming from jeep. People are killing to get their hands on one. just go on Ebay and see for yourself. Bronco first Edition is going for 6 figures with the buy now being approx 150K$.\n\nI would understand PS5 scalpers, but that happening with Cars, I never would've imagined. This shows how the demand of this car is insane and why Ford raised it's 2021 Revenue expectation from $3.5 billion, to between $9-$10 billion and they'll probably raise it again in the next quarter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**4- Ford's Governmental Fleet 3D chess Strategy:**\n\n\u201cFord clearly has business and government fleets in mind,\u201d Autotrader executive analyst Michelle Krebs said.\n\nFord revealed details of a less powerful version of its upcoming 2022 F-150 Lightning electric pickup for business and government fleets on Monday. Called the Lightning Pro, it\u2019s equipped with a standard battery that\u2019s good for an estimated 230 miles and costs $39,974, which is the base price for retail F-150 Lightnings.\n\nFord's vision to lead the EV market has a \u201cno-brainer\u201d component Elon Musk lacks: Targeting business and government fleet customers with new battery-powered trucks and vans. Ford\u2019s focus on converting Gas fleet buyers to electric models builds on the company\u2019s existing strengths and takes advantage of an opportunity created by Federal tax cuts. They know that they are already the best with no competitors when it comes to the quality or price of the F-150. They will literally destroy their competitors with this approach.\n\n# 5- Valuation and Price target\n\nYes, I'm crazy, but hear me out. It's obvious what argument I'm going to bring up next(Tesla valuation), but it's not only about that and I'll expand more about what I mean to convey.\n\n$Ticker - Market Cap - TTM Revenue MM - TTM EBITDA MM - Revenue Multiple - Ebitda Multiple\n\n(Numbers referenced from -\/JeffAmazon- outdated)\n\nTSLA - $679.7B - $31.54B - $4.27B - 21.1X - 202X\n\nNIO - $77.35B - $12B - ($7B) - 7.6X - (NaN)\n\nGM - $74B - $116B - $18B - 0.7X - 4.3X\n\nF - $47.17B - $127.14B - $10B - 0.3X - 4.4X\n\n**(Important part starts here)**\n\nAs you can see, this is crazy and retarded at the same time... Take any of the stocks above and compare it to $F, it'll always come out undervalued relatively speaking. For the people who are trying to justify these bs valuations, don't lie to yourselves. Your business degree doesn't work in this market meta. **These highly speculative valuations are built on retail investor hype and young buyers who justify very risky valuations. In meme stocks, retail investors are the market makers and they decide what valuations stocks deserve.** $F is superior in most financial metrics compared to the EV meme stocks(imo), yet it's still at the bottom of the valuation list compared to them.\n\nIf you are new to WSB, **$TSLA and $AMD were among our first great plays in here**, before $GME. We used to yolo deep OTM calls on $TSLA when the Press(mainly CNBC), analysts on social media, and boomers were all short $TSLA. When $TSLA was 350$(presplit), people on here were buying 1000$(Pre-split) calls!!! When it reached $1000$(pre-split) some yoloers in here bought 3000$ calls. We were the original adopters of $TSLA and we rose it to what it is today. Still not convinced? put a side by side chart comparison between $TSLA and $GME and see how the volume and price action was affected during each event. It's mind boggling.\n\nAt that valuation(110$), it won't even be 50% of Tesla's 52-week high valuation. It's a highly speculative valuation, but I don't see Ford being inferior to the other EV stocks. Don't even get me started on Chinese BS EV stocks with insane valuations and weak deliveries... Why raise fat foreign Chinese babies(Nio, XPENG, etc..)(metaphorically speaking) when Americans can literally raise a malnourished All American baby $F **\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 \ud83e\udd85**.\n\n**Ford is ready to dominate the EV market and it's just starting!**\n\n[My Ford Forecast illustrated with Crayons](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/4cwxwa68rrg71.png?width=786&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d66883a4eddd06a88a5799b3a19095280b050f4)","108":"Daily Popular Tickers Thread for August 09, 2021 - MVST | AMC | GME \nYour daily hype thread.

You can be held at a tax higher than your gain (some retard got a 800k tax bill in a 40k gain because of wash sale rule since he was trading same stocks 10+ times a day). \n\nBut do know that this rule, is made to stop shady things. It usually won\u2019t effect you because brokerages are smart enough to realize it and do mathematical calculation to your second buy to fix the wash sale rule instantly. But there can be mistakes. \n\nNOTE: you should only be paying taxes on your actual gain and deducting from your all losses (total after net year). If anything is wrong, see tax accountant instantly. \n\n2)  tax-loss harvesting\n\nThis is like algebra math where you try to add and subtract to get the best number. Say you have 2 positions, one in AMD and one in GME. You realized a gain (so you closed your position) on AMD but still have your GME options chugging along. Your GME options don\u2019t expire until next year but they are in loss. It\u2019s December- so you say \u201cwait, rather than pay full tax on my gains from AMD, why don\u2019t I close my GME positions for a loss and now I can subtract that loss from my AMD gain and pay less tax\u201d. \n\nThis also hopefully makes it clear why the wash sale rule is there. Because someone could be this at dec 31, and buy the same position at same rate in jan 1, and theoretically from tax point, essentially mitigated all loss on that GME position. \n\n3) deduction of capital loss\n\nYou say you have -20k realized loss in 2020. You can deduct 3000$ from your earned income every year until that 20k is used up. This means you lost 20k in stocks but made 60k in your job- you can automatically deduct 3000 from your income so now you effectively have a 57,000$ income for tax. \n\nNow some people are confused but this is only for EARNED INCOME. The 3000 deduction limit is so it\u2019s not abused. But say you have 2021 capital gain from GME of 15k. \n\nHere if you still had -20k loss of 2020, you can deduct the full 15k gain from 2021 so that -20k loss now is at 5k loss and use the remaining 3000 from 5k to deduct the earned income (from job) of 2021. For a total net loss of -2k still left for next year. \n\n4) positions that you hold for less than 1 year will be taxed at higher % than positions held more than year. \n\nThere are more Things like Tax-optimized Portfolio and many other tax implication that are too far out of reach for a single post but be aware of all these things. \n\nSPY 460c 9\/10- free money","110":"Do Hedge Funds beat the market? - I analyzed the performance of 5000+ Hedge Funds over the past 24 years and benchmarked it against SP500. Here are the results! Hey Everyone, it's u\/nobjos back with this week's analysis!  \n\n**Preamble**\n\nHedge Funds are a controversial breed of companies. On one hand, you have [Michael Burry\u2019s Scion Capital returning 489%](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Michael_Burry) shorting the housing market and on the other hand, you have [Melvin Capital losing 53%](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/GameStop_short_squeeze#Losses_by_short_sellers) of its investment value in 1 month following them shorting GameStop. Adding to this, most hedge funds have an eye-watering 2 and 20 fee structure -> What this means is that they will take 2% of your investment value and 20% of your profits every year as management fees \\[1\\].\n\nEven with these significant risk factors and hefty fees, the total assets managed by Hedge Funds have grown year on year and is [now over $3.8 Trillion](https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/271771\/assets-of-the-hedge-funds-worldwide\/#:~:text=Assets%20under%20management%20of%20hedge%20funds%20worldwide%201997%2D2020&text=In%202020%2C%20the%20value%20reached,managers%20in%20the%20United%20States.). Given that you need to be an institutional or accredited investor to invest directly in a hedge fund \\[2\\], it begs the question\n\n**Do Hedge funds beat the market?**\n\n**Data**\n\nThe individual performance data of hedge funds are extremely hard to get \\[3\\]. For this analysis, I would be using the Barclay Hedge Fund Index that calculates the average return \\[4\\] of 5,878 Hedge Funds. The data is available from 1997.\n\nThis dataset was also used by [American Enterprise Institute in their analysis](https:\/\/www.aei.org\/carpe-diem\/the-sp-500-index-out-performed-hedge-funds-over-the-last-10-years-and-it-wasnt-even-close\/), so the data must be accurate. All the data used in this analysis is shared as a Google sheet at the end.\n\n**Result**\n\n[ ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/rrgu9o8705g71.png?width=882&format=png&auto=webp&s=781036d4ac5a896c8ed5bf391b623255f1f5898a)\n\nS&P500 has beaten the hedge funds summarily with it returning a whopping 222% more than the hedge fund over the last 24 years \\[5\\]. This difference becomes even more drastic if you consider the last 10 years. During 2011-2020, SPY has returned 265% vs the average hedge fund returns of just 60%.\n\nThis awesome visualization by AEI shows the enormous difference in returns over the last 10 years.\n\n[ ](https:\/\/i.redd.it\/32eyi1hb05g71.gif)\n\nIf you are wondering about the impact of this on the average investor (who will not be able to invest in a Hedge fund due to the stringent capital requirements), these above returns correlate directly with the returns of [Fund of Funds (FOF)](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/f\/fundsoffunds.asp). FOFs usually invest in a wide variety of Hedge funds and do not have the capital requirements required by a normal Hedge fund so that anyone can invest in it.\n\nThe catch here is that you will be paying the management fee for both FOFs as well as the Hedge Funds. This implies that your net return would be even lower than directly investing in the Hedge Fund. This becomes apparent as if you consider the last 24 years, on average FOFs (Barclay Fund of Funds index), returned 233.1% (\\~390% less than avg Hedge Fund) vs SPY returning 846%!\n\n**Warren Buffet\u2019s take of Hedge Funds**\n\nIn 2007, Warren Buffet had entered into a famous bet that an unmanaged, low-cost S&P 500 stock index fund would out-perform an actively managed group of high-cost hedge funds over the ten-year period from 2008 to 2017 when performance was measured net of fees, costs, and expenses. The result was similar to the above with S&P 500 beating all the actively managed funds by a significant margin. This is what he wrote to the investors in his annual letter\n\n>A number of smart people are involved in running hedge funds. But to a great extent their efforts are self-neutralizing, and their IQ will not overcome the costs they impose on investors. Investors, on average and over time, will do better with a low-cost index fund than with a group of funds of funds.\n\nPerformance comes, performance goes. Fees never falter\n\nWhile I don\u2019t completely agree with this view that it\u2019s impossible for Hedge Funds to beat the market (The famous [Medallion Fund of Renaissance Technologies](https:\/\/ofdollarsanddata.com\/medallion-fund\/) \\[6\\] have returned 39% annualized returns (net of fees) compared to S&P 500\u2018s \\~8% annualized returns over the last 30 years). But, it seems that on average Hedge Funds do return lesser than the stock market benchmark!\n\n**An alternative view**\n\nIt would be now easy to conclude now that Hedge funds are pointless and the people who invest them in at not savvy investors. But,\n\n[ ](https:\/\/i.redd.it\/hoiy89zc05g71.gif)\n\nGiven that the investors who invest in Hedge Funds usually are high net worth individuals having their own Financial Advisors or Pension Funds having teams of analysts evaluating their investments, why would they still invest in Hedge Funds that have considerably lesser returns than SPY?\n\nThe answer lies in [diversification and risk mitigation](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/articles\/03\/121003.asp).\n\n[  ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/gre25fff05g71.png?width=1020&format=png&auto=webp&s=66cda7571f6f8a3ffe63e9f6ea12d2700523fc83)\n\nThe above chart showcases the performance comparison between S&P 500 and Hedge Fund over the last two decades. We know that SPY had outperformed the hedge funds. But what is interesting is what happens during market crashes.\n\nIn the 2000-2002 period where the market consistently had negative returns (Dotcom bubble) in the range of -10 to -22%, hedge funds were still net positive. Even in the 2008 Financial crisis, the difference in losses between SPY and hedge funds was a staggering 15%.\n\nThis chart also showcases the important fact that most hedge funds are actually hedged pretty well in reality \\[7\\]. We only usually hear about outliers such as Michael Burry\u2019s insane bet or how Bill Hwang of Archegos Capital lost $20B in two days which biases our entire outlook about hedge funds. To put this in perspective, over the period from January 1994 to March 2021, volatility (annualized standard deviation) of the S&P 500 was about 14.9% while the volatility of the aggregated hedge funds was only about 6.79% \\[8\\].\n\nWhile you and I might care about the extra returns of SPY, I guess when you have 100\u2019s of Millions of dollars, it becomes more important to conserve your funds rather than to chase a few extra percentage points of returns in SPY.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI started off the analysis with the expectation that Hedge Funds would easily be beating the market so as to justify their exorbitant fee structure. As we can see from the analysis, on average they don\u2019t beat the market but provide sophisticated methods of diversification for big funds and HNI\u2019s.\n\nEven if you want some effective diversification, it would be much better to invest directly with established hedge funds rather than going for Fund of Funds as with the latter, most of your returns would be taken by the two-tiered fee structure.\n\nWhat this means for the average investor is that in almost all cases, you would get a better return on your investment over the long run by just investing in a low-cost index fund. Replicating what pension funds and HNI\u2019s do might not be the best strategy for your portfolio.\n\nGoogle sheet containing all the data used in this analysis: [Here](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1nOQPyHdRNaRSv-c04iBRndvsgMDP78uSLKbxMwGWkeo\/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n\\[1\\] To signify the impact of this fee, let\u2019s take the following e.g. if you invest $100K into a hedge fund and at the end of the year, your fund grows to $120K, they would charge you $2K (2%) + $4K (20% of the profit) for a total of $6K. Even if they lose money, they will still charge you $2K for managing your money. Vanguard SP500 ETF would charge you $30 for the same!\n\n\\[2\\] Minimum initial investments for hedge funds usually range from $100,000 to $2 million and you can only withdraw funds when you\u2019ve invested a certain amount of money during specified times of the year. You also need to have a minimum net worth of $1 million and your annual income should amount to more than $200,000.\n\n\\[3\\] Barclayhedge provides data for the performance of individual hedge funds but it costs somewhere between $10-30K. I like you guys, but not that much :P!\n\n\\[4\\] The returns are average not weighted average based on the asset under management so it\u2019s representative of the individual returns of the Hedge funds and does not bias the analysis due to the size of the Hedge Fund.\n\n\\[5\\] Please note that the SPY returns are not net of fees. But this would be inconsequential as a low-cost Vanguard index fund has fees as low as 0.03%. The returns shown for hedge funds are net of fees.\n\n\\[6\\] To put the performance of Medallion Fund in perspective (its considered as the greatest money-making machine of all time), $1 invested in the Medallion Fund from 1988-2018 would have grown to over $20,000 (net of fees) while $1 invested in the S&P 500 would have only grown to $20 over the same time period. Even a $1 investment in Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway would have *only* grown to $100 during this time.\n\n\\[7\\] For e.g., some hedge funds by inexpensive long-dated put options that hedges against a sudden market downturn. While this would ultimately make their net return lower in a bull market, in case of a huge crash, they would still be positive. [This](https:\/\/thehedgefundjournal.com\/fat-tails\/) article discusses more on fat tail risks in the market and how hedging is done.\n\n\\[8\\] The volatility is calculated using [Credit Suisse Hedge Fund Index](https:\/\/lab.credit-suisse.com\/#\/en\/index\/HEDG\/HEDG\/performance).\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a financial advisor!","111":"How to use the $1T US Senate Infrastructure Bill to Place Bets this Fall and Get Rich w\/ America Sup Retards\n\nI am here representing the high-functioning half of RetardedHedgeFund LLC. I founded RetardedHedgeFund with my brother way back in 2021, when, one day, my brother came to me asking for help laundering $17 that he stole from some teenage boys. As has unfortunately happened many times before, my brother took the money after beating a group of boys senseless because they had made fun of his doll collection. Now, despite what some people around here seem to think about hedge fund managers, I am not one to typically take part in financial crimes such as money laundering, but the last time my brother had stolen money in this way, the State Police came to our door and demanded he return the cash. For whatever reason, the fact that the police asked for the money to be returned, ticked my brother off. He started kicking and screaming and punching police officers, until he wound up in the psychward and I was left with a rather large hospital bill. So there I was, stuck between my brother's insurmountable anger management issues, the State Police,  and the fact that teenage boys will never stop making fun of a grown man who sits on a public street in his underpants playing with dolls, especially when that man is well known for being a violent adversary to teenage boys. I digress.\n\nIn that moment, I thought the best way to avoid a similar confrontation with the police, would be to \u201claunder\u201d my brother\u2019s $17 using a broker app and one of the fine stocks found in the Wallstreetbets portfolio. After helping my brother scour the first class market data available on WSB, we decided to go all in on AMC. As one might expect, in nearly an instant our $17 grew to over $1000. I told my brother we were selling, to which he started yelling \u201cbuy and hold\u201d while punching me in protest, and then snatched the phone from my hand. For better or worse, during the scuffle, my brother fat-fingered Robin Hood and sold our call option right when AMC hit $69 and we were left with $1123 USD in our broker account. My brother wanted to put the money immediately back in AMC, but I slyly convinced him it would be better to reinvest after it was confirmed that resistance at $420.69 had been broken. That\u2019s when we decided to take our $1123 and found our family-owned hedge fund, RetardedHedgeFund LLC.\n\nWith our freshly minted LLC, my brother wanted our first buy to be the cheapest GME calls available, and as many as we could get. However, I managed to convince him that since we were now officially big time Wallstreetbets players with our own hedge fund, we should take a look at the more mature memestocks of mememania round two. Eventually, we wound up 40% down on CLNE, which is why we are here on a Saturday morning reading a yet-to-be passed 2700 page US Senate [Infrastructure Bill](https:\/\/www.epw.senate.gov\/public\/_cache\/files\/e\/a\/ea1eb2e4-56bd-45f1-a260-9d6ee951bc96\/F8A7C77D69BE09151F210EB4DFE872CD.edw21a09.pd), praying we find someway out of this god forsaken play.\n\nIn all sincerity, from what I\u2019ve read thus far, I\u2019ve found the bill quite compelling, especially in terms placing bets this autumn. I haven\u2019t read a federal bill since I briefly taught Social Studies in what the US President had recently deemed an \u201curban disaster,\u201d and a \u201ccomplete shithole.\u201d Luckily, none of my students could read, so they never found out that I can\u2019t read either. My brother on the other hand, with his severe cognitive disability and far-below average IQ, is actually well-suited for the craft of US Law, and he has helped me sift through the gargantuan pdf to pull out a section that gave us enough hope to keep holding CLNE.\n\nI know that a lot of you reading this will have an adverse reaction to the mentioning of CLNE, and probably think I should cut my loses and load up on 0dte spy options or juicy AMC calls at the 140 strike, but that\u2019s not what this is about. This post, which will be getting progressively less shitpost-y (unless you think the Infrastructure Bill is a shitpost), is about the $1T Infrastructure Bill presently being amended in the Senate and likely to, in some form, become law by September. There is a seemingly endless amount of provisions within this bill that could lend themselves to both bull and bear theses for the coming months. For instance, I considered posting about another play I am researching, Lithium Americas Corp (LAC). Everyone knows there\u2019s some stuff in this bill about lithium mining, but it also has a surprising amount of legislating about Native Americans and \u201cIndian Land\u201d management. It so happens that a section of North America\u2019s largest lithium deposit is also the site of an exceptionally haunting Native American massacre and Indian burial ground known as *Dead Moon,* which has presently entangled LAC in a lawsuit with local tribes and stopped them from breaking ground at Thacker Pass. I will probably dig through the bill for LAC related content after my brother goes to adult summer camp, but for now, much like teenage boys and the State Police, my brother has a seemingly irrational hatred for indigenous peoples, and so he insisted we research CLNE and not LAC.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to convince anyone here to invest in CLNE\u2014in fact the last thing I want is Wallstreetbets gangingbanging CLNE again. You (we) people brought the worst kind of attention to this stock, and instead of gliding gently up to $20 all summer like I originally imagined, the CEO Andrew Littlefair has been issuing shares and shaking us all down, and, even worse, after he hyped up the meme rally on CNBC last June. This sub got the PnD vibes all up on this pile of manure.\n\n**Infrastructure Bill** **& CLNE DD**\n\nFor those of you who know nothing other about CLNE other than cow fart emojis, *\u201cClean Energy Fuels provides natural gas as an alternative fuel for vehicle fleets and related fueling solutions, primarily in the United States and Canada. It supplies RNG, compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquefied natural gas (LNG) for light, medium, and heavy-duty vehicles. Additionally, the company offers operation and maintenance services for public and private vehicle fleet customer stations.*\u201d They take methane from a biomass (cow farts) and turn into a gas that powers engines comparable to diesel, and they also are getting into hydrogen for fuel cells for private vehicles, buses, trucks, airplanes, spaceships, submarines, carbon neutral dollhouse electric generators, etc. A big part of it is a carbon emissions play, and since CLNE is expanding their infrastructure as fast as anyone in the field, the Infrastructure Bill has everything to do with them.\n\nI don\u2019t know what other retard\u2019s High School environmental science class experience was like, but I had this hippie, kind-of dyke-y but in way that was subtly hot, teacher tell me that California would be on fire by 2025 and Florida would be sinking if we didn\u2019t do things like turn cow farts into fuel for Amazon trucks. That teacher was eventually fired after she was found in a locked room with my brother while he was wearing only his underpants, but the cow farts thing stuck with me.  This 10th grade level understanding of environmental science was the reason I originally bought into CLNE \u2013 that coupled with the fact that a lot of federal politicians today look and sound like my high school science teacher did back then, and more and more politicians of all stripes are coming around to the idea of at least cashing in on greenwashing. Greenwashing trending upwards with potential federal financial support is good for CLNE.\n\nOverall the bill looks incredibly bullish for CLNE. It appears bi-partisan support has grown for RNG, carbon emissions reduction, methane capture, fuel production from feedstock and biomass, and hydrogen fuel cells. There is massive amounts of money being boasted in this bill going to things like grants, loans, tax incentives, support for labor. It\u2019s unclear at this point how much this is progressive pandering and an unattainable pipe dream, and it seems unlikely it will be nowhere near as far-reaching as the New Deal era infrastructure funding, but it might be coming at just the right time for many.\n\nHere are some highlights from the [earnings call](https:\/\/www.fool.com\/earnings\/call-transcripts\/2021\/08\/06\/clean-energy-fuels-corp-clne-q2-2021-earnings-call\/) which we can compare to elements of the Infrastructure Bill.\n\n* Increasing supply while in talks with \u201cdozens of dairies\u201d sign on as partners. (Infrastructure will be needed to capture cow farts.) \n* The largest vehicle fueling infrastructure in the country, which provides the mechanism to generate the valuable environmental fuel credits.\n* Signing RNG supply contracts with third-parties to meet today\u2019s growing demand.\n* Increasing customers in New York, Arkansas, Nebraska, California, and whatever state Amazon is.\n* Facilitating training classes with the Natural Gas Vehicle Institute for dozens of maintenance technicians who will be keeping the Amazon trucks on the road.\n* Electric \tand hydrogen-fuel cell trucks, albeit great, are perhaps limited by \tinfrastructure and mineral resources. Using the \"California Air Resources Board carbon intensity scoring, \\[an \texample\\] company would have to purchase over 6,400 electric heavy duty trucks, or 13,000 fuel cell trucks to achieve the same carbon reduction as only 1,200 trucks running a negative carbon RNG.\"\n* Recently submitted bids to build hydrogen stations for transit agencies that will be testing a handful of hydrogen buses.\n\nContent pulled from the bill to get an idea on language and numbers of provisions that might help CLNE:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* $20,000,00 wastewater grant for each of fiscal years 2022 through 2026, which includes funds for sludge (cow shit) collection, installation of anaerobic digester, methane capture, \tmethane transfer, facility upgrades and retrofits, and other new and emerging, but proven, technologies that transform waste to energy.\n* Some related grants have requirements such as must be \u201cregionally dispersed across the United States and can leverage natural gas to the maximum extent practicable\u201d which fits CLNE current business perfectly.\n* \u201cAppalachian regional energy hub initiative\u201d  The Appalachian Regional Commission may provide technical assistance to, make grants to, enter into contracts with, or otherwise provide amounts to individuals or entities in the Appalachian region for projects and activities, that will help establish a regional energy hub in the Appalachian region for natural gas and  natural gas liquids, including hydrogen produced from the steam methane reforming of natural gas feedstocks. (Grants to develop methane capture infrastructure, bullish sign for potential third-party contractors in new localities.)\n* $52,488,065,375 \tthrough 2026 per each to build infrastructure to reduce highway emissions.\n* Massive \tamounts of funding going to hydrogen found in Tittle III FUELS AND TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS. The entire Title III may be worth a look through if you want a bullish feeling for CLNE, but especially \u201cSubtittle 3--Hydrogen Research and Development,\u201d as \tRNG can be used to produce zero emissions hydrogen, and it \tspecifically mentions getting hydrogen from biomass and bio fuels, so it\u2019s easy to see CLNE taking advantage.\n\nWhether it\u2019s intentional or not, a lot of Littlefair\u2019s language on the call seems to come from having spent some time reading the bill. Big investors interested in CLNE are also likely watching the bill to estimate where state money is going.  Perhaps Littlefair is aping the bill's language in order to appeal to big investors, and if this is true, it would seem Littlefair was successful because there was a plethora of institutional buys on the day after the call.\n\n**The Present State of CLNE Stock and Retail Perception**\n\nI bought into CLNE in June when it was under $10. I had spent weeks staring nervously at exceptionally retarded calls on another stock and wanted to just park some money somewhere and let it drift upwards while I dozed through the summer, and CLNE seemed like a good buy at $10. Analysts had (have) it anywhere from $10-27, and it seemed like the recent changes in DC would lend to even more upside. Then Wallstreetbets started shouting about CLINE SI% (which barely made any fucking sense, by the way) the stock shot up to $15 on retail power and perhaps the relatively few shorts there exiting, all the retards, including my brother,  lost money on calls, and the mood about CLINE around here got very negative.\n\nInstead of drifting up to twenty, CLNE spent the summer drifting down to $6. I did not enjoy it, but I held the bag, believing it would have to go up eventually. When the earnings report came-out last Thursday night, and at the same time the stock slumped to its 2021 low, I was in despair. Where were the greenwashing greenbacks? What we\u2019re the politicians in DC doing besides trying to figure out if their pants are on or not, shouting about a vaccine that half of the population refuses to take, and looking for their son\u2019s laptop?\n\nAs culturally enriching as the president\u2019s son\u2019s DIY tweaker porn is, I thought perhaps there might be even more going on behind the scenes in DC when I decided to peak into the Infrastructure Bill. In all earnestness, I was very doom n gloom at 5AM the morning after CLNE earnings. I was smacked from sleep at 3:30AM with anxiety about a sell-off, and lying in a semi-hypnagogic state, I shit you not, I see floating above my bed, a funny looking man with big ears in a cow field, smile and say, You should just sell, son. The earnings report stated a decrease of 99.2% (yes, 99.2% decrease, just like your memestock calls). Supposedly this decrease was due to a tricky deal with Amazon, but I didn\u2019t want to think about Rocketman blasting off with hydrogen, any more than I did Littlefair issuing shares. I wanted money. Furthermore, the news is blaring about Delta variant, people invested in 3rd world vaccines are shouting about the ineffectiveness of mRNA in the rage filled chatrooms of my broker app, and I start thinking I should cut my losses with CLNE and invest in a Playstation so I can try to teach my brother how to play *Last of Us* in order to prepare him for inevitable modern tribal warfare coupled with a zombie apocalypse.\n\nThe earnings were, in actuality, not nearly as bad this Amazon deal made them look. Although revenue decreased because of the deal, CLNE increased RNG sales by 13%. As Litlefair said in the call, \u201cexcluding the effects of the Amazon warrant charges and the commodity swap and customer fueling contracts unrealized losses, revenue for the second quarter of 2021 increased by 28.9% to compared to  for the second quarter of 2020.\u201d\n\nThis is going to sound cheesy, but the Infrastructure Bill was a little ray of sunshine during what, in my more narcotic induced brain damaged moments, seems clearly to be the end of the world. My hedge fund does not participate in electoral politics publicly or privately; my brother is not allowed to vote (not because he\u2019s retarded, but because he\u2019s a convicted felon), and I find elections to have an adverse reaction with my relatively fragile mental health. I don\u2019t think a political party is going to save Earth from the human race. I think it is just as likely California will cease to be a state the moment Andrew Littlefair\u2019s cow fart machines explode and fire consumes the entire West Coast. But there is actually something in the bill that I have not felt from the federal govt probably ever in my life, but especially since the pandemic started, and that was some sort of expectation that there will be a future. Despite my better judgment, this sensation felt good to me. Furthermore, this sensation, to me, seems to be an excellent marketing tool for this particular moment and it will make the bill and it\u2019s consequences at least temporally popular. People have indulged in their unchecked desires for societal collapse and death for the last 18 months, and I think perhaps we are sick of it. What people want to know now is that they can work (and yes, actually have jobs) to improve the world for a future with or without COVID.  The Infrastructure Bill is going to create jobs that some people (at least momentarily) will feel good about doing, it\u2019s going to increase revenue in multiple sectors (and decrease it in some), it\u2019s bi-partisan, 70% popular with voters, and in the end, it could probably pay for itself by not making the money printer go brrrr so much once everyone has a decent job again. To me, of course, all this gooey-oooey goody two shoes democracy hoopla is a load of BS, because ultimately what the bill will do is at last make CLNE drift gently up to $20. I believe it already may have begun to do that before the bill is even passed, in fact.\n\nAt 7.48 CLNE is a good to buy if you don't mind holding for months, possibly year for big gains. After skimming through the bill the last couple days, I don\u2019t really see a limit to the upside. The Federal Govt. is going all in on financially supporting a phase-out of fossil fuels. Oil is likely to get tanked by another winter of COVID, while the govt is going to be offering grants, subsidies, loans, to companies like CLNE. With vaccines and better knowledge of the virus, CLNE is likely to able to continue increasing productivity. Retail isn\u2019t really buying these days, but institutions greatly increased their holdings this past week, with the majority of big buys coming in the day after earnings were released.\n\nI\u2019m now taking all of our incoming funds and investing them into CLNE shares, every time my brother beats someone up and steals their money. Risky options don't seem worth it here right now, because the stock price seems relatively in the control of big money, and big money will be the one selling you the options. The stock is largely owned by institutions, likely because it\u2019s easy to imagine how revenues will be on a steady uptrend for many years to come, especially with this Infrastructure Bill presently making it's way through congress. That said I could see $8 by Aug 20, if I were to place a relatively placid bet.\n\nTL;DR: you all are retarded but maybe not as retarded as me bc I\u2019m bagholding CLNE. I combed through the infrastructure bill, looking for bullish indicators. I found a lot of implications for CLNE but lots of provisions that could affect many stocks in very specific ways.\n\nThe Infrastructure Bill is worth paying attention for gambling purposes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: fixed the linked to earnings and fixed some writing mistakes.

We are at the very beginning of a major space race between the US and China and the US seems to want to use private contracts instead of expensive and heavily politicized\/decentralized nasa contracts with like 50 expensive companies (which is why they\u2019ve been mired down with bureaucracy for decades). ASTR has secured this contract which is huge, but the upcoming first military launch will prove the company and continue the upward momentum. Rocket Lab has this catalyst going for it, and many others. It\u2019s absolutely a better, more diversified, more proven, and more consistent launch provider then Astra which is why I have hella options in that one too (currently ticker VA CQ).\n\nI came onto Astra and Rocket Lab because I love space, not with my investment mind (I do my gambling on the side, like a true addicted degenerate). It\u2019s because of the substance and significance of the companies that I think they are great investments. Rocket Lab is a visionary genius of a company that will do great things, and Astra is a classic smart people applying their NASA expertise with a businessman leading the way that is likely to print for a while. \n\nThese companies are very likely to go to the moon, 100% literally, in the next decade, and so they are great long term holds and plays. But they are also phenomenal short term plays because big money is nervous and unsure about the sector. Big money is not a geeky fan of space, they would not have the background to understand how big these companies are likely to be. They aren\u2019t dumb, so they are picking up on the idea, but for now while the word \u201cSP AC\u201d is keeping most institutional money at bay, retail has a hell of an opportunity to buy up some dirt cheap options (well at least on Rocket Lab, Astra is still cheap but obviously a lot more expensive today then yesterday) and some really cheap, low valuation stocks for either short term plays once people wake up about their true value, or as long term plays as that value happens in the real world. \n\nImagine thinking a space tourism company like $SPAC is worth $10 billion when these companies who are set up for a decade of growth similar to the internet boom are worth around $1 billion. Even that gap is a 10x return but both of these companies will be closer to (though definitely not the same as) the valuation of SpaceX which is over $75 billion. Y\u2019all can do the math. \n\nY\u2019all I invest in things that I know, I invested in Tesla in 2014 (in 7th grade, so not a whole lot of money), I invested in Moderna at the beginning of last year (though I sold early like an idiot) and ya boi rode the waves of GME and AMC all the way down and then back up to a tidy profit. If y\u2019all want to gamble, you could do MUCH worse then Rocket Lab and Astra.\n\nEdit: TL;DR $ASTR and $RKLB are phenomenal\n\nEdit 2: I hate robinhood but I\u2019ve been too lazy to transfer out of it","116":"Daily Popular Tickers Thread for August 05, 2021 - AMD | GME | AMC \nYour daily hype thread.

(People being too afraid to post loss) Hey everyone so I\u2019ve seen some systematic discrepancies between the loss and the gain flair. \n\nIn a single given day you could have almost 30 times more gain post than loss post. This obviously doesn\u2019t make much sense because I would almost guarantee that there are more people losing than gaining this sub alone. I don\u2019t usually post gains or losses in the sub Reddit because usually they don\u2019t really matter. You can make 100% gain or lose 90% but if it\u2019s just simple trade it it\u2019s not really interesting to post. Right like if you gain with Apple options than well yeah it\u2019s a gain but it\u2019s not interesting to post really. \n\nBut the reason why I think this is a problem is because people especially new traders have this false sense of always making money. And I don\u2019t know why the The lost porn became so dried because throughout the history of the sub posting your loss was basically an assured popularity and respect because not only did you make a bad trade but you were willing to share that with everybody else. Imagine if  analfarmer2 only ever posted when his spy plays made money. Or how deepfuckingvalues was posting his position a year ago when it was down 50%. \n\nTo me it kind of feels like a lie and also kind of pussy behavior. If you are an investor and you will post literally any single gain you have ever made in your entire life conveniently scrub away all the losses\u2014kind of makes it seem like you just want people to think you are good at reading right and you being good at trade. \n\nI don\u2019t wanna call out the mods or or even demand a change and I don\u2019t even know how popular the sentiment is in the sub right now because I know there are about 2 million people That actually remembered What does sub was like before gamestop. \n\n#My simple solution is to have a requirement that every gain post, or even every loss post, must include a second picture at least that shows the entire account to date chart. So if you post a gain from a trade, at least a second picture of your main chart with \u201call\u201d showing how much you started with and how much you have now. \n\nI think it\u2019ll show a better picture of how these traders are actually doing rather than simple gain trades overwhelming every single day. \n\nAgain I don\u2019t know how popular the sentiment is in the sub and I am certainly not demanding any change because I am but one person out of million here so I don\u2019t know what every one of you want or even think about the loss and gain discrepancy a problem.","120":"Virtu Financial DD ($VIRT)  \n\n**Virtu Financial DD:** \n\nVirtu Financial **(VIRT)** is a publicly traded Market-Making (MM) firm. Yes, I know owning a market making firm seems like a risky idea; however, I am about to lay out the **Bull Case** for owning this company. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Bull Case:**\n\n**LongTerm Thesis:**\n\nIn order to start the Bull case I want to discuss a well known company that recently IPO\u2019d\u2026 You may have guess it, this company is Robinhood **(HOOD)**. Robinhood is a brokerage that makes its money buy selling its customers orderflow. Who is buying this order flow? You guessed it, MM firms! In the last quarter we can see that Virtu Financial made $575M from their Market Making business, that is after the payment for order flow! \n\n  \n\n[MM Net Income](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/sqdxuo0ct6f71.png?width=811&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8b26f3b7a4dc1d254a70d0693209dfa559a9138)\n\nTo see the breakdown we can look at the next table. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[MM Income Breakdown](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/a93cd02ft6f71.png?width=813&format=png&auto=webp&s=e447a22d9328f9666745c00708e7e6e8b3646b96)\n\nVirtu generated $801M in MM revenue and paid only $223M for the order-flow to the brokerages, ex. Robinhood. This is a **gross margin** of **72.2%** on the MM business. That means for every $1 VIRT pays to a brokerage, they are able to make $3.59, or $2.59 in profits! Not to mention this profitability scales as Robinhood and other brokerages grow meanwhile, VIRT doesn\u2019t have to pay a penny for the customer acquisition costs! \n\nThis is one reason why Virtu had a revenue of $1,073M last quarter, HOOD only had a revenue of $522M. While Virtu has 2x HOOD\u2019s revenue, has a more profitable business, and has less expense to grow revenue\/customer base, HOOD\u2019s MC is \\~$38B to VIRT\u2019s \\~$5B. \n\nVirtu\u2019s P\/E is always fluctuating as market volume is the key indicator to VIRT\u2019s revenue but I believe we have entered a new market trend where active management is here to stay. New traders and investors are obsessed with the markets and love to buy and sell positions with a much shorter holding period than historically. This may be due to the gamification of trading apps, or a plethora of other reasons but all that matters is the trend of average volume increasing across the broader market. \n\nJumping back, you may have noticed the spotty revenue figures seen in Q3 and Q4 2020, why is this? Well Q1 and Q2 of 2020 had very high volumes due to the Covid-19 crash and following rebound. This is another great reason to own the stock, let me explain. VIRT literally makes way more money when the market crashes because volumes spike during the panic. That means VIRT is not correlated to the overall market and actually has a %-year Beta of -0.29.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[5-year Beta](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ggyphr2st6f71.png?width=431&format=png&auto=webp&s=97b9b6970900eba7ac8e6bcd04eac3601bd33d20)\n\nWhen the market crashes, VIRT benefits therefore the shares can be sold, and used to buy other companies at very cheap valuations! \n\n**Short Term Thesis:**\n\nDuring Q1 2021 meme-stocks were all over the news. Gamestop made incels and plebs into multi-millionaires which drew in mass amounts of volume into the markets chasing similar returns. Due to this unexpected volume VIRT EPS beat by 63% (Actual: $2.04 vs Expected: $1.25). This meme-stock craze has continued in Q2 2020 with AMC, CLOV, BB, SPCE, just to name a few. (Just pull up the charts and look at June volumes, too many charts to attach) \n\nPersonally, I expect EPS to be below Q1 as total market volumes decreased by approx 25%  Q2 2021 than Q1 2021, as seen below. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[2021 Q2 Market Volume](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/5lj1v6yht6f71.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd90334c4ecf1d4063f0eb60c440dae24c5aaa8e)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, I still believe VIRT will easily beat the expected EPS of $0.81. \n\n**Q2 2021 earnings call is Before Market Open tomorrow Aug 4th, 2021.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Share Repurchases:**\n\nVirtu Financial has been aggressively buying back shares as they are currently trading at a ttm P\/E of 4.91. (Not using Forward P\/E cause earnings estimates have been proven to be inaccurate) Virtu started repurchasing shares in Q4 2020 purchasing 1.4M shares (0.7% of float), 2.3M shares in Q1 2021 (1.2% of float), and 1.6M shares in first 2-months of Q2 2021 (0.8% of float). \n\nSince the last earnings on May 4th, 2021 the share price traded from \\~$28\/share upto $32\/share and has recently fallen to $25\/share allowing for buyback to continue at these low levels.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Technicals:**\n\n1. Daily RSI is currently at 37.\n2. MACD has reversed and is forming a bullish pattern.\n3. Share price is pushing up against the 20-day SMA.\n4. August 20th (and others) options are merely 40% IV pricing in a very low expected move.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Concerns:**\n\n* SEC is investigating payment-for-order-flow, which is key to this business.\n\nCounter: CEO of Virtu has been on many media calls where he explains that as an MM they are actually creating price improvement on market-orders which would actually be executed at higher prices if they didn\u2019t exist as an MM. \n\n[https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Q474x33a25w](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Q474x33a25w) (start at 3:00 for price improvement discussion)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* As re-opening continues, new traders will have less time to focus on active management.\n\nCounter: Human nature makes habits very difficult to break. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Market-making is so profitable currently that competition will eat away profitability.\n\nCounter: Existing relationships with brokerages. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Positions:**\n\n[Positions](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/pkz1lbdvt6f71.png?width=516&format=png&auto=webp&s=847b1aee727c302102358c9b573d86133697e4c0)\n\n**TLDR:** Meme stocks have continued into Q2 2021 with high volumes. Virtu Financial **(VIRT)** is an MM-firm which benefits from high-volumes, and growth of active investing without customer acquisition costs. VIRT has recently fallen due to a SEC investigation which lacks any evidence of wrong-doing to retail investors. Share repurchases are accelerating.

So, Don't act on anything posted in here and proceed on your own risk...)\n\n**\u26a0\ufe0fERECTION ALERT!\u26a0\ufe0f** Before reading this post, make sure that you are wearing sweatpants\/Bras because you're guaranteed a sustained penile\/nipple erection throughout your reading. So, Don't embarrass yourself in public...\n\n5 months ago, I spent so much time on part 1 and 2 and after posting them, I sadly realized that people are lazy \ud83d\ude02 Apes don't want to read mountains of DD, They just want a 5th grade level TLDR. This Ape got you, I will try to make this DD a longer version of a TLDR! I'll try to make it concise and to the point as much as possible.(5 hours later, I failed at this objective lol)\n\n**1- Ford's secret weapon unleashed:**\n\nFor the last **44 consecutive years**, the F-150 has been Americas **best selling Truck**. In 2019, the Ford F-Series was **second only to the Apple iPhone**, which  raked in **$55 billion**, in terms of **total revenue** generated. The F-Series **generated more revenue than the NFL, MLB, NBA, and the NHL combined**, Just something to think about.\n\nOn May 19, Ford has unveiled its EV F-150 after Biden had driven it a week prior. The EV's features are mind blowing exceeding all expectations (Watch MKBHD review or Fords 5 min ad video). It has all the features crucial for it's **target buyers** (Construction workers, Farmers, Free-lance delivery drivers, Basically hardworking Blue-collar Americans...) and it's **a Truck which actually looks like a Truck.** \u201cFord knows what pickup owners want,\u201d IHS Markit senior analyst Stephanie Brinley said. More importantly, it's an F-150 first, an EV second, Ford didn't abandon the F-150 core design which has been successful for 44 consecutive years.\n\nThe reservation now have exceeded 120,000 since it's debut. An important point the CEO mentioned on the call was that **about 75%, or 90,000, are new to Ford, according to the company!** If anything, this indicates that Ford is the runner up for Tesla in the EV competition. almost every car manufacturer can make an EV, but only a few (I can count on one hand) can supply enough cars to keep up with demand with superb price and quality.\n\nNow Ford's EVs are targeting middle class value buyers (High quality, cheap EVs to compete with TESLA and they are destroying Tesla for the past 4 months with sales, more on this on #5). The F-150 starts at  $32,500 after Federal tax credit!! Cheaper than any of **\"Potential(because they don't exist yet)\"** competitors with superior car features. \n\nIt's relevant to mention that Ford's EV sales (counting electric vehicles and hybrids) increased 177% during June, capping off 56,570 units sold so far in 2021.\n\n**As Ford promised, F-150 Lightning will deliver more features, and cost less...**\n\n^(Don't forget about potential upcoming Ford SUVs, and a Bronco EV which might be announced this year.)\n\n**2- Ford Rivian Partnership:**\n\nFord-Backed EV Automaker Rivian is planning to IPO as soon as September. It's looking for a valuation of 70Billion which is valued more than Ford Right now \ud83d\ude02(Ford is 55.64B at 14.18$). Ford has initially invested 500$ million in Rivian, but it added much more of an undisclosed amount with **the most recent news being 902$million in Q1 of 2021.**\n\n**On Jul 23, it was announced that Rivian closed a $2.5 billion funding round,** led by existing investors **Ford**, Amazon and T. Prior to it, they announced plans to open a second manufacturing plant and U.S States started submitting bids on it.\n\nFarley is quick to say Ford did not invest in the Michigan startup to make money in the stock market. **As more companies continue to invest in Rivian, Ford benefits from the increased value of its shares,** \"but that's not why we invested,\" Farley said in an interview with MotorTrend.\n\nFarley with his 3D chess moves is probably investing in it to make a move to dominate the EV-SUV market too **with a Lincoln or Explorer-Rivian car**. He understands that **the first move is the most important one in the EV Game,** and with the Mach-E and F-150, Ford executed it's moves perfectly! Farley wants to take as much of the market share as possible with low prices, high quality, while maintaining the demand(something which Tesla still isn't able to). Ford can do that due to their international factories and cheap oversees labor mentioned in Part 1.3\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3- Bronco capturing Buyers of other brands:**\n\n Prior to the release of the Bronco, it had 190,000 reservations. **66% of the reservations were converted to sales!** Additionally, Farley mentioned in the earnings call that 70% of the 125,000 orders it has are customers of other brands. \n\nAccording to Ford, dealers are keeping Broncos on the lot for an average of **15 days!,** with a big chunk of of the buyers coming from jeep. People are killing to get their hands on one. just go on Ebay and see for yourself. Bronco first Edition is going for 6 figures with the buy now being approx 150K$. \n\nI would understand PS5 scalpers, but that happening with Cars, I never would've imagined. This shows how the demand of this car is insane and why Ford raised it's 2021 Revenue expectation from $3.5 billion, to between $9-$10 billion and they'll probably raise it again in the next quarter. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**4- Ford's Governmental Fleet 3D chess Strategy:**\n\n\u201cFord clearly has business and government fleets in mind,\u201d Autotrader executive analyst Michelle Krebs said.\n\nFord revealed details of a less powerful version of its upcoming 2022 F-150 Lightning electric pickup for business and government fleets on Monday. Called the Lightning Pro, it\u2019s equipped with a standard battery that\u2019s good for an estimated 230 miles and costs $39,974, which is the base price for retail F-150 Lightnings.\n\nFord's vision to lead the EV market has a \u201cno-brainer\u201d component Elon Musk lacks: Targeting business and government fleet customers with new battery-powered trucks and vans. Ford\u2019s focus on converting Gas fleet buyers to electric models builds on the company\u2019s existing strengths and takes advantage of an opportunity created by Federal tax cuts. They know that they are already the best with no competitors when it comes to the quality or price of the F-150. They will literally destroy their competitors with this approach.\n\n# 5- Valuation and Price target\n\nYes, I'm crazy, but hear me out. It's obvious what argument I'm going to bring up next(Tesla valuation), but it's not only about that and I'll expand more about what I mean to convey.\n\n$Ticker - Market Cap - TTM Revenue MM - TTM EBITDA MM - Revenue Multiple - Ebitda Multiple\n\n(Numbers referenced from -\/JeffAmazon- outdated)\n\nTSLA - $679.7B - $31.54B - $4.27B - 21.1X - 202X\n\nNIO - $77.35B - $12B - ($7B) - 7.6X - (NaN)\n\nGM - $74B - $116B - $18B - 0.7X - 4.3X\n\nF - $47.17B - $127.14B - $10B - 0.3X - 4.4X\n\n**(Important part starts here)**\n\nAs you can see, this is crazy and retarded at the same time... Take any of the stocks above and compare it to $F, it'll always come out undervalued relatively speaking. For the people who are trying to justify these bs valuations, don't lie to yourselves. Your business degree doesn't work in this market meta. **These highly speculative valuations are built on retail investor hype and young buyers who justify very risky valuations. In meme stocks, retail investors are the market makers and they decide what valuations stocks deserve.** $F is superior in most financial metrics compared to the EV meme stocks(imo), yet it's still at the bottom of the valuation list compared to them.\n\nIf you are new to WSB, **$TSLA and $AMD were among our first great plays in here**, before $GME. We used to yolo deep OTM calls on $TSLA when the Press(mainly CNBC), analysts on social media, and boomers were all short $TSLA. When $TSLA was 350$(presplit), people on here were buying 1000$(Pre-split) calls!!! When it reached $1000$(pre-split) some yoloers in here bought 3000$ calls. We were the original adopters of $TSLA and we rose it to what it is today. Still not convinced? put a side by side chart comparison between $TSLA and $GME and see how the volume and price action was affected during each event. It's mind boggling.\n\n At that valuation(110$), it won't even be 50% of Tesla's 52-week high valuation. It's a highly speculative valuation, but I don't see Ford being inferior to the other EV stocks. Don't even get me started on Chinese BS EV stocks with insane valuations and weak deliveries... Why raise fat foreign Chinese babies(Nio, XPENG, etc..)(metaphorically speaking) when Americans can literally raise a malnourished All American baby $F **\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 \ud83e\udd85**.\n\n**Ford is ready to dominate the EV market and it's just starting!**\n\n[Ford Price Target Forest illustrated with crayons](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/9lbgo0lg7de71.png?width=848&format=png&auto=webp&s=eea5e203cda0de8a7a7856c4f3475d0abc536519)","127":"Daily Popular Tickers Thread for July 30, 2021 - AMD | AMZN | GME \nYour daily hype thread.

Robinhood will innovate drastically and develop ways to make money that is not payment for order flow in the future thus increasing the profit margins and net income.\n2. Robinhood will increase their userbase by 150x equating to 2.54billion people, all of which have an average balance of the current user base in USA where stimulus checks , money printers, and high disposable income go brrrr.\n3. Robinhood increases the net revenue generated by each user by around 150x. Either 150x more volume is traded per user, or the bid\/ask spreads from payment for routing exceeds 150x current.\n4. A combination of the above. 50x user growth and 3x profit margin growth.\n5. Assume that operating costs are fairly negligible and linear due to SaaS being economies of scale based.\n\nBear Case:\n\n1. Robinhood is a \"Trading software that's thinly veiled as a technology company\" and should be given the P\/E of a tech company that can scale exponentially.\n2. Robinhood faces regulatory risk expanding outside of USA and even if every man woman and child deposits what the average APE has on the platform right now and trades at the frequency of an average RH APE- We would reach a P\/E of 217.\n3. If Robin hood abolishes the methods of: \"Payment for order flow and uses monthly fees\/data charges\" it will lose a large part of the entirety of its' branding. It would be like if Apple abolished the iPhone. Free Trading is their Model.\n4. As Order Flow is a linear business, 1 unit of order flow results in $1 extra. In order to reach 150x multiplier to reduce PE to 'reasonable tech company levels' we would be looking at 150x the net volume being transacted on Robinhood.\n5. Robinhood\n\nExcerpts from S-1 Filing:\n\nWe incurred operating losses each year since our inception in 2013 through 2019, including net losses of $6.1\u00a0million, $57.5\u00a0million, and $106.6\u00a0million for fiscal 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively. We expect our operating expenses to continue to increase in the future as we increase our sales and marketing efforts, continue to invest in research and development, further develop our products and services, improve and expand our customer support functions and expand into new geographies.\n\nMoreover, as of March 31, 2021, options to purchase 18,096,127 shares of our Class A common stock with a weighted-average exercise price of approximately $2.23 per share were outstanding and 81,820,160 shares of our Class A common stock were subject to outstanding RSUs (including 27,663,658 shares subject to 2019 Market-Based RSUs).\n\nThere are currently > 96 million shares held by employees.\n\nFunding Rounds:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Year |Amount|Valuation|Baggers at IPO price|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|2017|110m|1.3b|24x|\n|2018|363m|5.6b|5.7x|\n|2019|323m|7.6b|4.2x|\n|2020 |280m|8.3b|3.8x|\n|2020|320m|8.6b|3.7x|\n|2020|200m|11.2b|2.8x|\n|2020|460m|11.7b|2.7x|\n|IPO Price||32b||\n\nBull Case 1:\n\nRobin Hood has been growing at a very fast rate therefore its' valuations validate this. The insider investors are incentivized to hold.\n\nBear Case 1:\n\nThe insiders made anywhere between a minimum of 2.7 --> 24x already within the last few years, private firms typically take profits and reinvest in other startups. (Unless Robinhood grows at exponential rates going forwards)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSelling Pressures:\n\nImagine if you're an Ape working at RH and you can cash in on a 10-20 bagger immediately in 30-days, would you sell?\n\nAn average engineer who worked at Robinhood for 4 - years on average holds \\~ $400k-800k in RSUs (at a price of $2 per share).

I\u2019m in the market. I\u2019m here to make money. But so is everybody else, and their granny. But wishful thinking only gets anyone so far. That much I realised pretty quickly. I thought that very realisation made me better than the most. But alas! There still seems to be a long way to go. The majority in the active markets seems to be losing. A very, very small proportion of the active markets seems to be doing the winning. Within this sub-group, an astronomically microscopic proportion seems to be winning purely by non-randomness. Some random GME-powered-nouveau-riche-dude begs to disagree. \u201cI was smart enough to do my DD; you weren\u2019t!\u201d, he argues. \u201cBut what about the long list of many other smart people who did their DD in many, many other potential situations that didn\u2019t go as per plan? They were right with their analysis, but their gamble just did not pay off. What about them?\u201d I ask, with utmost diligence hoping to get an honest answer to my gnawing question. GME-Dude says, \u201cYou are completely whack. Do you even know how an option chain works? Do you know how a gamma squeeze works?\u201d, he asks me back with scorn. I give up. Life is too short for unproductive arguments.\n\nShould I have listened to my late grampy Mr. John Bagel, and just indexed to eff out of my life savings? As a wise sage once put it, \u201cThe Bagel is a lie!\u201d Heck! Who am I kidding? It wasn\u2019t a wise sage. It was some poor soul from Portal. And it was cake, not Bagel. Anyhow, \u201cWhy do I have to wait 50 years before I can afford Bagels?\u201d, I ask myself righteously. The question motivates me to justify my continued jedi-journey in the active markets. I study hard. I think hard. I work like a lazy-tard. I go into deep and dark places in search of arcane and precious knowledge. Now and then I come over to the surface and try to scavenge on reddit. All of a sudden, from the left flank comes the dreaded \u201cWheeler-Army\u201d. Some of them are sneaky buggers. They sound very clever, until you realise that they\u2019re selling wheels that are shaped like Bagels (not this shit again!). \u201cGotta GTF outta here!\u201d, I tell myself, as I move swiftly. I\u2019m then flanked from the right side by random Stat-dudes. \u201cHey looky here! I did an analysis of deep OTM KITTY-CONDORS at 5.235 sigma, and I\u2019ve been making money for 7 whole months; more on my website!\u201d I roll my eyes, duck under and try to make my way out. An attractive Option-mage jumps out of nowhere, and presents to me a very elaborate looking flowchart that describes scenario analysis. \u201cThis complex system is guaranteed to make money\u201d, she says. \u201cThe catch? The choice of underlying is the key. And to follow how I choose my underlyings, follow me on my ONLYFA.. \/scratch that\/ my website, and support me on patreon\u201d, she generously offers. I take a deeper look at that complex flowchart again. \u201cHang on an effin minute! That looks like a frickin Bagel. Don\u2019t tell me that\u2019s a W-H-E-E\u2026\u201d. That\u2019s it! Before I lose my sanity, I dive underground; just thankful that I survived my reddit visit this time.\n\nWhen I\u2019m on my jedi-journey through the deep and dark caves, I sometimes come across beautiful underground lakes, where I sit down on quiet spots, and ponder: \u201cIf only the majority realises the ruthlessness of the spreads. If only they had an inkling of the rakes. If only they knew that the entire system is designed to lure them in. If only they paid attention to the consistent winners. If only..\u201d What difference does it make? Even if everyone magically figured it out, a supreme minority will emerge, and eke out its dreaded edge. It\u2019s the ultimate truth that my late uncle, Mr. Alfredo Naruto beat into my head until I was numb from the pain. Besides, am I not one of them? Am I arrogant for not considering myself as one among the majority? My results are an indication that I am barely avoiding the majority. If I am not careful (or spend too much time on reddit), I might end up in the majority any second. It\u2019s a cut-throat world out there. Along my journey so far, I have had the blessings of mathematical-wizards and polymaths. I need them, for I am otherwise just an ordinary nobody. Even with all these blessings, the only way that I am (barely) avoiding the majority is by embracing the fact that I am gullible and fallible. Plus, I don\u2019t do KITTY-CONDORS. Oh, and I actually didn\u2019t fully diss the advice from my late grampy, Mr. John Bagel. I\u2019m hedged to be able to afford bagels 50 years from now, just in case that the Bagel is NOT a lie, and I manage to not kick the bucket by then.\n\nIf you found these personal notes useful, consider supporting the Mr.Nobody foundation on my ONLYFA\u2026.okay, okay, just kidding. I wish you all the best on your jedi-journey as well.","131":"How to use side way trading days to your advantage (SPY) and understanding IV This works for every security in existence but today I\u2019ll talk about SPY and GOOGL. \n\n\nFor those of you that don\u2019t know, in our battle, delta and IV are our friends and theta is the murder-rapist-genocidal-racist hitler. \n\nDelta is easy to understand- it goes from 0-.x-1 and all it means is that every 1 dollar increase in the stock gains you delta*100 dollars. So a delta of .76 means you gain 76$ for every 1 dollar increase. \n\nNow IV is a bit more complicated and it has to do with how big of a movement a stock does. If A stock moves a lot, than the IV will increase and this will make your extrinsic value of the option go up. (Extrinsic basically means potential profit given time compared to intrinsic which is when your option is in the money and so every gain the the stock is intrinsic and cannot be changed with time). Everything is a bit more complicated but this is simplified.\n\nWhile most times, IV is not enough to over ride delta, there are some times when the IV is more important than delta and will actually help you. For example, if GME goes from 150 to 1,000$, there is a very good chance that you will actually GAIN on some of your puts because the IV is adding more value than your delta is taking out. \n\nRecent example: some of you may have realized that GOOGL did 3% last week and the options were up to 1400%. But today, GOOGL did same yet the options are only up 150%. Why? It\u2019s because of IV crush. This is a difference of 7X. IV was almost 7X stronger than the delta here. But this was earnings day so maybe it\u2019s special? No. \n\nIV crush is generally for earnings but it can happen at any time. Same with SPY, you may have wondered why sometimes spy does 1% and options are like 1,000% up but other times spy does 1% and options bearly crack 200%. This is a daily IV change. Playing IV can net you massive returns or loss depending on your understanding. \n\nNow why do side ways trading helps you? Well because SPY has ended its day at -.04%, this is basicly 0. This means the IV is super low. This also means anyone that has bought calls or puts for Friday will see massive returns if spy goes in either direction. \n\nYou may have also wondered why your calls or puts were down 30% or more today when spy closed at -.04%, this has to do with IV dropping causing the theta loss to be multiplied.\n\nPS: I know half you fuckers lost money on TSLA. Why is the loss flair not booming? Stop being cowards and post them.\n\nJust this week, there were 23 posts about TSLA yolo.  Yesterday there were 2 loss porn posts. \n\nStop being a bitch and post them. There is no way the loss:gain ratio in this sub is 1:10.","132":"Part 1: Risk management for the Aggressive Retail Trader: Buying options So I've been thinking about risk management in a way that works for the new aggressive retail trader. The traditional 1% of your portfolio value in trades(PV= $10,000 thus each trade should be $100)  is the recommendation but might not be worth your time or seem realistic.\n\nHeck, if you are working a decent job and have a good budget on your finances you might be willing to sacrifice a bit more is probably what you're thinking.\n\nWell that's what I did and it brought me great success in 2020 and 2021 so far. Though I'm not recommending everyone that needs to do this. This is mostly for the aggressive trader.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/jc2o51qj4yd71.png?width=1355&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d3ed1c98a7d9ccf9e5e04036ca9fc1e08410787\n\nWe are in a new era of trading where we get excited about yolo gains but ignore the fact that this is a small sample size of a mass group of people. We tend to leave out does that fail and how times has that person failed to get to that point.  Well this is survivorship bias in action. Any who, you might be  thinking.. If that person can get 400% gain, I can at least get 100% or a piece of that. Very motivating..inspiring..intoxicating..right?\n\nHowever if catch yourself throwing more than 30% of your portfolio value into just ONE TRADE\u2026then this is for you to put the brakes on sabotaging your account and prevent you from quitting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Buying options, for me is consider going on offense and Selling Options going on defense.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo we are going to focus on the buying options first since that's what most traders start off with and I might make a selling options post at later date.\n\nSo to start with the basic assessment question:\n\n1. What am I willing to lose?\n2. . This can be tricky, causing new traders to abusively diamond hands their options\/shares and baghold. Raise your hand if this is you. So we must ask a more detailed question:\n   1. **How much am I willing to lose, so that my lost doesn't wipe out my monthly\/ YTD profits?**\n3. By asking this specific question, it lead me in a **performance based mindset.** I wanted realized profits on a weekly and month basis. NOT unrealized( when you don't sell). This gave me the space to think about the chances of  making back those profits, if I lost the money in one or few bad trades. So I narrowed it down to these percentages.\n4. Calls or Call Debits Spreads - 10% or less of Portfolio value (graph below)\n   1. It seems risking to losing 10% of PV to make 20-50% gain on trade is a good mix\n   2. Some plays overtime might zoom pass your price targets and you might just let some run, just remember to take profits because you need your portfolio to grow and not get stuck with a lucky win.\n   3. As the Portfolio grow in value due to great trades, inject new capital, long position growing, you will start to use less capital for calls\/puts\/debit spreads.\n   4. New trader make a mistake and risk it all and then have to wait **MONTHS to restart or they just give up and blame stock market sucks.** You might also here, **it works until it doesn't** lol.  Thus being stuck in the hamster wheel of the rat race. **Re-read this point again.** 5x Don't write yourself off too soon, especially if you haven't put in at least 1 year of trading.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Debit Spreads for more consistent gains?\n   1. Almost becomes a cheat code, because typically there is still equity in the trade as time passes, and your losses is limited. If your underlying goes against you, and there is more than 5 days to expiration you mostly can close out early or place a stop loss order to prevent further loss. With Calls and puts time decay and IV crush is a bitch..point blank period.\n   2. It's best to stick with SPY, IWM, and\/or QQQ but if you want to gamble with individual stocks, just know it very difficult to save the trade or escape quickly, since most of you are probably doing weeklies.\n   3. With debit spreads always close out your trade yourself to **avoid assignment**\n\nBelow is the difference between Call and Call Debit Spread.\n\n1. Both serves as a purpose of a bullish move but if the stock price is at or above the short strike price the debit spreads is also a neutral strategy\n2. The Call option, is roughly double the cost but infinite profits(this is on SPY so a rapid price movement in a day would typical not exceed more than 1-1.5% in a day.\n3. Notice how the call loses premium each day if price action stay stagnant and the debit spreads preserves capital in this scenario and as each day gets closer to expiration, the potential of profit is higher than the call but profits is limited.\n4. Below is both ATM options for call (1) and Bull Call Debit Spread (2)  on the Same expiry date.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Call \\(1\\)](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/676rri2l4yd71.png?width=1242&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d8939a284a0a8b31baa17e1631ee2c1547886ca)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Bull Call Debit Spread \\(2\\)](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ont5tqim4yd71.png?width=1250&format=png&auto=webp&s=54022e39074087836e7074e737c07bec3b60c833)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not against Calls. I used them only strategically or for gambling trades on GME, AMC, SNDL, AMD due to the low premiums plus expected rise in volume at the time **where it didn't make sense to do a debit spread due to opportunity cost.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBelow is a visual and potential outcome, you can look to see if you had 25 winning trades per year, hence executing more and being responsible is key. So 50 winning trades could be a goal or 25. This is just for motivation and the numbers below isn't compounding based off reinvesting the profits. Obviously as PV grows your trades will become larger if you follow some sort of guidance, like below.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/m6vtw7pp4yd71.png?width=948&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b9d9a6500f3e19d5f3b05a8bb88b867d793e4f5\n\nYou see with the small account you might be wondering..mhmm I should just put $990 in a trade and keep going..right but that will be 20% of your portfolio value meaning all it will take is 5 trades to destroy your account.\n\nThose who built an account to $25,000 or more through trading have some experience but still may be a beginner in trading if they are only executing a few trades a year and go \"lucky\".\n\nThere is even 6 figure professionals, who start off with a large account , think they know how to trade based off their professional 1confidence and risk it all as well without having any proper risk management and business sense.\n\nBut if you feed your portfolio with new capital in the beginning, eat crow, go on defense with expenses and be a student of game putting 25 hours of homework and trading a week, then you can get your goal asap.\n\nPretty Simple stuff but the questions is.. **Do you really want to put in the work?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSidenote: Highly recommend keeping a options journal.

However, just like GME back in 2019, it has very strong fundamentals and it is trading at a price that's several times below its intrinsic value.\n\nI believe the reason why the short float on $DOYU is so low is because no one with a brain believes this company is worth less than this. In fact it seems like smart money knows this company is worth much more than its current value.  Is there risk? Of course there is, and much more considering that I am going to incrementally build an all-in position.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut there is risk in every stock. I firmly believe that the CCP has no reason to come after $DOYU, especially since it is a fundamental piece to maintain healthy competition in the Chinese online gaming streaming industry, as currently it stands as the second largest company by number of monthly active users.\n\nWhen it comes to delisting risks, the compliance period is 3 years, starting in 2022, which means that no delisting will occur for any Chinese company listed in US exchanges until 2025. And by then many things will have changed, included perhaps an improvement in the China-US relationship and\/or some tweak in Chinese laws that will allow Chinese companies to make enough data available to US regulators so that no delisting has to take place, not to mention the US Presidential Elections.  Eventually I think it is possible China will try to herd all its foreign-listed companies back to mainland, but not in the near future because the Chinese markets can't sustain the capital-hungry companies that currently list in US exchanges.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is in no way a short-term forecast for DOYU's price. It is DD for DOYU as a long term investment. It might take months or years for any significant price hike, but I believe it's intrinsic value will eventually force it to happen.","134":"Daily Popular Tickers Thread for July 26, 2021 - BABA | AMC | GME \nYour daily hype thread.

This post is in continuation of a series of posts I made in the previous weeks. The response I received was amazing and a lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. You can find last week's post [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/omr5g2\/top_social_stocks_of_the_week\/). \n\n \n\nHey Guys,\n\nHope you had a great week in the market. As we can see below SPY finished strongly with it rising 2.5% over the last week. As of Friday, 88% of the S&P 500 companies that had reported second-quarter results exceeded analysts\u2019 earnings estimates \\[FactSet\\].\n\n[ ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/4znzaw4pldd71.png?width=1132&format=png&auto=webp&s=41fcea7420fdd703438ab0ea78edd9f3bd16ae64)\n\nEven though there are some inflationary concerns, Fed is widely expected to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged\u2014and at a near-zero level\u2014when it concludes a two-day meeting on Wednesday. Given the majority of the market ended in the green, let\u2019s see how the most popular stocks performed.\n\n### Most Discussed Stocks of the Week\n\n[ ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/c5k0ghasldd71.png?width=1039&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2610ef3759eb94e168fc56c2678bcd44a810a71)\n\nAll the popular stocks except WISH and CLOV ended in green last week! Moderna is the newcomer to the top 10 list with a 22% jump in stock price. The controversy regarding the vaccine decision is accurately reflected in the sentiment with the stock having only 0.5% after having a very strong rally. SPY continues to be the most discussed stock with AMC, WISH, GME & CLOV all having almost similar discussion volumes.\n\n### Top Growing Stocks of the Week\n\n[ ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/kkvafthtldd71.png?width=1211&format=png&auto=webp&s=720ce3bbfe426cdf0c383a7b62f016dd5d828e0f)\n\nAs this is now the earnings season, most of the stocks exploded in chatter primarily due to their earnings releases.\n\n**Snap Inc(SNAP):** SNAP shares soared 23% on Friday following their exceptional quarterly report. The company posted 293 MM global daily active users which is 23% more when compared to last year. Adding to this, the company also reassured the investors that they would not be impacted by the iOS 14.5 privacy changes as it had anticipated.\n\n**TAL Education Group(TAL):** TAL stock was down 70% on Friday following the news that the Chinese Govt might tell for-profit educational institutions to become non-profit organizations. As per CNBC reports, educational training institutions are banned from raising money through stock listings and foreign capital will not be allowed to invest. The news also caused other educational companies such as Youdao(DAO), Gaotu Techedu (GOTU), etc. to drop significantly.\n\n**Beachbody Company(BODY):** BODY has completed its three-way merger with Myx Fitness and Forest Road Acquisition Corp last month. This made it one of the largest subscription health and wellness companies for the mass market. The rising stock price and some very well-researched DD\u2019s ([here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/okfasr\/beach_body_stock_is_it_gonna_boom\/) and [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/oow4uo\/bodybeachbody_a_deep_value_digital_and_connected\/)) have contributed to the increasing chatter.\n\n**Intel Corporation(INTC):** Intel reported its quarterly earnings on Thursday. Even though the company beat revenue and EPS expectations, the stock price fell 2% following the cautionary guidance the company issued for the next quarter. Intel also said that PC unit sales were up 33% over last year. Investors were bullish on the stock predominantly because of the increasing focus the US govt has on fixing the semiconductor supply chain.\n\n**Moderna Inc(MRNA):** The company was trending and the stock price was rallying after European health officials recommended authorizing the drugmaker's coronavirus vaccine for kids 12 and older. This in addition to growing calls for a booster dose for newer covid variant\u2019s have pushed to stock price up. But the decision to vaccinate kids 12 and older was not well received by everyone as can be reflected in the sentiment. (There is a slight difference in sentiment between both the charts as the latter was pulled 6 hours later)\n\n**Until next week!**\n\n*As always, please note that I am not a financial advisor.*","136":"Men of the Clov Bag Watch - a TA of everyone's favorite ticker, with a side of DD Did you come to Wallstreetbets today to have your ~~terrible~~ *excellent, well-thought out* investment decisions validated? Are you scrolling endlessly, searching in vain for that sweet, sweet hit of confirmation bias? Well, my friend, this **is** ~~not~~ the post for you! Featuring the great horizontal line drawing skill you've come to expect from a guy named Cbass, with a ***free bonus*** of some non-horizontal lines! Wow! So much value! Wait--THERE IS MORE! Now, for a limited time, some rambling, low-effort DD that you'll probably just scroll past on your way to spamming rocket emojis!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Table of Contents:**\n\nPart 1. Meme Status\n\nPart 2. Cum-tastic Charts\n\nPart 3. Donkey Dicks\n\nPart 4. The Short-Term Gamble\n\nPart 5. The Long-Term Gamble\n\nPart 6. And now my Watch has begun....\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------\n\n**Part 1. Meme Status**\n\nI've stated [elsewhere](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/oib6l8\/the_state_of_the_meme_a_ta_of_all_your_favorite\/) the definition of 'Meme Stock' I use, but in short it is thus:\n\nMeme-DDs get made & price goes up-->Options Wizards buy options & **Thing** happens-->idiots FOMO in at terrible prices, then diamond hand-->diamond hands result in higher-low-->repeat for next leg up.\n\nBasically, there are two kinds of plays around here: True Memes and P&Ds. The True Memes have two distinguishing features: 1) the involvement of the Options Wizards who buy all those options forcing the MMs to hedge and causing the **Thing**, and 2) after the retracement, the price action stabilizes at a **higher-low**.\n\nObviously, this could all just be me seeing bunnies in every cloud. I'm naught but a simple man with his intentions writ clear upon his trucker hat, so take what you will from my ramblings. However, when comparing the likes of GME, AMC, BB and BBBY with things like RKT, CRSR, WISH, WOOF, etc, it appears there are some tickers that have the follow through after the initial push and those are what I'm calling the True Memes.\n\nSo, is CLOV a True Meme? Answer: **it's hanging on by a worn thread**.\n\nIt remains my contention that a higher-low is a requirement for the 'follow through' on these plays. After all, if the ticker returns back to its pre-meme price (which for many of these is the all-time low), or worse, goes even lower, what then did the 'diamond handing' accomplish? Answer: jack shit. Think of it this way: if a bunch of people flood into the stock and buy up enough of the float, supply and demand dictate that the price *should* stabilize at a higher-low. Yes, the stock market is full of fuckery and it's not as simple as all that, but if the price just slides back to the low, the simple conclusion is: there are not as many of you as you think there are.\n\nAlso, going back down to the pre-meme low, or worse, is about as demoralizing as it can get. Many so-called 'apes' are going to say 'fuck it, I was had' and dump their shares for a loss. Further, it is going to severally damage the image of the play, making it look like 'nothing more than another P&D.'\n\nOf course, I could be proven wrong here. CLOV could fall down and put in a new all-time low before shooting the moon. Who cares if you're wrong as long as you still make money.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------\n\n**Part 2. Cum-tastic Charts**\n\nFirst, the daily chart with Cbass's patented horizontal lines:\n\n[Clov-tastic](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/2p48jy2j27d71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b6072e7598b01fd3df17d33b2a42a28dd6ea97f)\n\nMy theory regarding the True Memes was not merely a higher-low, but that the higher-low should ***specifically*** be around the breakout level of the previous move. We are way the fuck under that, so I'm just gonna toss that one out the window because it both makes me wrong and fills me with regret. So I've just applied Cbass's Second Law of TA: When you're wrong, just move the lines until you're right again.\n\nLast week, the ticker found some support at $8. Which is technically a 'higher-low', with the all-time low being $6.31. That's $1.69 higher. ***Impressive***. It was actually an obvious place to stabilize (for a few days). I mean, everyone and their mother knows the 92.5% Fibonacci retracement level is like, *totally* the real level and super-duper important.\n\nNext up, I've prepared two charts in accordance with Cbass's First Law of TA: You can always find a chart & indicator combination to tell you what you want to hear.\n\n[Sexy wedge breakout that totally means something](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/7l37izwj57d71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=81806c9a7a1da78f165d2caad87c6c85459b1073)\n\nAs you can see here, I found the **hidden** downward wedge that we've already broken out of, and therefore the next logical stop is $100\/share. ***This is how TA is done***. I've seen some posts by some fucking rank amateurs that I'm pretty sure were referring to me when they claimed that there were people posting 'tons of shitty TA.' Bruh, you wish you had these skills. Cbass don't need no fuckin' Bollinger bands, Keltner somethings, so-called 'moving averages' or any of that fancy bullshit. I *could* do it all with horizontal lines, but look here, I figured out how to draw *other kinds of lines*.\n\nHere's another example of my superior line-skills:\n\n[Look at 'em skills and burn with jealousy](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/mstskgyi77d71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b988d3bf2c072f6e219e4dd7b95547e1bdd5ab4)\n\nHere you can see we were in a downward channel from the beginning of the month and we're now not in ***that*** downward channel. Which means we **can't possibly** go down anymore. Again: $100\/share imminent. Furthermore, the upper channel has clearly turned from resistance into support. Bruh, it just do get more bullish than this.\n\nExcept if I do this:\n\n[Drawing a sad-face downtrend line](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/flgwlice77d71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=59d666de69e1bb228c5511f701266f7eb2a068a2)\n\nHere, I just found a different line that maintains the bearish case. In this world, when the price gets back up to the red dashed line, it will be promptly rejected to $0. But I own this stock and this outcome doesn't make me any money, so for ***reasons*** this chart is wrong and we definitely do not exist in this version of reality.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------\n\n**Part 3. Donkey Dicks**\n\nNow, I've never done DD on anything until *after* I bought it. Thus, in keeping with tradition I've taken a cursory glance at the underlying company of this wunderkind of a ticker after finding myself down 40%. In short, it's ***basically shit.***\n\nSomeone right now is screaming Cathie Woodisms at their screen, like: **disruptor, innovator, AI, machine learning, tech, growth, next-gen**, etc. Dude, these guys sell insurance to old people. Worse, they only sell one kind of insurance: Medicare Advantage. Will they make money in the future? Yeah, sure. But there is no fucking universe where this narrow category of business is going to command a premium like Tesla or whatever the fuck Cathie is pumping these days. You can fantasize about the whole of the human species paying endless subscription fees for the privilege of being driven around in a self-driving Tesla that smells like someone had sex in the back seat. You're high, but it is *technically* possible. Clover Healthcare has a subset of the elderly in one country as their maximum consumer base. And the government has their hand in the mix.\n\n\"But they're saving the government money with their ***software platform***!\" 1) The government doesn't actually give a fuck about saving money. If the past two years taught you nothing else, I hope this at least got through. 2) Calling a computer program a 'software platform' doesn't make it anything more than a program where you input information. Is it really that much more than a fancy version of Microsoft Excel? I doubt it, but maybe if they gamify the button clicking they can get people hooked with the dopamine effect. It just looks like advertising to me; kind of like when the term computer program got replaced with 'app' in order to make it sound like something more than just a program running on your phone. Whatever, before I ever get old enough to be on Medicare Advantage, I'm going out in a blaze of hookers and coke so I'll never get the chance to click those buttons.\n\nCLOV gets compared to a lot of the mainline insurers, e.g., United Health Care (UNH). UNH has a market cap *literally* 100x CLOV, and yet people are like \"CLOV totally ***deserves*** to be valued like UNH.\" UNH has an income of $14.5**B**. CLOV is at -$55**M**. Even sitting at a market cap of $395**B**, UNH is only running a p\/e of 27.6, with a forward p\/e 19.4. They are a massive company that offers all varieties of insurance and they are making fucking bank, thus their stock is steadily climbing to the moon. You can point at the 80\/20 rule and make the case that it is responsible for the spiraling cost of health care in America and I'll nod my head and agree, but that does not mean CLOV is riding into this dusty town to save the day. They are in too narrow a category to have an appreciable effect on overall costs, in my opinion--assuming they have any effect at all.\n\n\"But Clover is growing at ***double digits***!\" It's easy to grow double digits when you start with no customers. After 2023, I believe the estimate is 5-7% per year. It's not terrible, but it's not going to take you to the moon. If CLOV is able to expand out into the general insurance market and take away market share from the big boys, then okay, there's some case for the crazy valuations people are throwing around. But I've as much chance of snorting lines off the titties of a Victoria's Secret model while raw-dogging her on the hood of a brand new lambo parked on my yacht... anchored off the pristine white sand beaches of my new private island.\n\n[Be Bold, sign up for Globo Gym](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ecokntoqi7d71.jpg?width=970&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=827d4edb502eb6f0993de5c284bc6b9e2d2182b2)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------\n\n**Part 4. The Short-Term Gamble**\n\nSo, given that the TA on CLOV is a crap shoot (as all TA is) and the underlying company is less than amazing, why the fuck would anyone in their right mind buy this ticker. Simple: **gambling**. That is what CLOV was, is, and all it ever will be: a gamble. And *you came here gamble,* because this is the fucking casino. That's why I bought it. I was wrong about an immediate turn around after the first launch and so now I'm stuck sucking pond scum. Such is life.\n\nIs the short-term gamble over? No, not yet. As the charts show, CLOV is bottoming out, which means the next direction ***should*** be up. Obviously, because it's gambling, down is possible, but nobody came here to hear that. Furthermore, CLOV remains one of the top tickers sentiment-wise. A lot of eyes balls has the potential to materialize that sudden move upward that everyone is pretending they're not here for. On top of that, the SI remains high. I think the importance of SI is way overblown, but most people think otherwise and that belief alone will drive retail toward the ticker. Finally, it looks like the Options Wizards took one shot at this thing (I don't know this for certain), and there is a chance they will come back around to it if things start moving up. Thus, there remains the potential for a second massive launch.\n\nSo let's assume someone is looking at this and thinking, \"Okay, based on the charts I might take a stab at this.\" The next question is: Get in now, or wait for $7? This is impossible to answer, of course, but if you are like me, then if you buy now, it will drop to $7 because the stock market exists to fuck with you, ***specifically***. By the same rule, if you wait, then it will take off without you and you'll FOMO in at $25. Pick your poison.\n\nOf course, my theory of these plays states a breakdown back to lows ends the play. If it does happen, I will obviously just revise my theory so that I'm still not wrong--because I do TA how it's supposed to be done.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------\n\n**Part 5. The Long-Term Gamble**\n\nLong-term, CLOV is still just a gamble. The delusional idiots will tell you this is a 'can't fail' investment. All investments can fail, including this one. People like the 'fall-back' position: i.e., I gambled on the short-term jump and lost, but that's okay because long-term this is a 100% winner. This is how you get ~~delusional bagholders~~ *a cult*.\n\nAt the current price level, is CLOV a good long-term gamble? It's the definition of mediocre. Will it be at $500 in ten years, 'because that's where UNH is now'? Not unless JPow initiates hyperinflation, in which case that new fleshlight you've got on your Amazon wishlist is going to be a $1000--so, you know, *bigger* problems. A more reasonable target is mid-20s (low $30s at best) within 2-5 years assuming there is no moon landing and the retail interest dies off and CLOV becomes just another ticker in the garden. The current 12-month average price target is $10.30.  Again: **This is gambling**.\n\nThere are a bunch of believers for this stock (like any ticker that gets its own sub reddit), and I think if we end up in the long-gamble, much like poor Lord Stannis, they will be in for some disappointment.\n\n[What you thought you bought vs. What you actually bought](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/giidi4f4q7d71.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c200009a29a4702ba7ca271b799dd3dce03ade6c)\n\n\\------------------------------------------------\n\n**Part 6. And now my Watch has begun**\n\nI'm a bagholder. I'm not gonna lie about it, bullshit you, tell you I'm happy about it, or claim I've discovered the secret to curing your financial woes. Much like Stannis, First of His Name, Rightful King of the Seven Kingdoms, I thought I was to be the savoir of my own story and yet here I am, freezing my balls off at the Wall with a bunch flee-ridden dudes and an old lady in magic makeup, waiting to see if the cold or the ice zombies kill me first.\n\nAs you can see from my positions below, I'm not in the worst spot--not in the best, either. My odds of break-even are pretty good. I might have to wait two years to get there, but I think I'll get there even if CLOV falls off the face of the internet. My odds of doubling my money are okay, if I'm patient enough. Which I won't be... obviously. Odds of 10x in 10 years *without* the Wizardry: 0.1%, ***exactly***. Like all my trades, my entry into this position is full of shoulda, coulda, woulda's.

He also called NOK a buy, so definitely buy CLOV instead NOK.","137":"So you made some money on a Yolo and now you want to take the leap from full-blown retard to a low functioning Autist. Here's a breakdown of my port to give you a starting point from someone who used to be just like you. Disclaimer: This is not financial advice and you shouldn't assume that I have any idea what I'm actually talking about. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAbout Me: I am a former GME ape who managed to turn $5k into $30k back in January without having any idea what I was actually doing. Over the next 5 month's I had varying levels of success with other Yolo plays. At 3 different points, I hit $60k, $65K, and $55k, but those highs were separated by lows of $28K, $32K, $42K. By the middle of May I had enough of this roller coaster and developed a trading strat that I felt leveraged my desire for big gains with my desire to protect my fucking money.  Note that these numbers are **max potential values**. You don't need to have all your cash in the market at once. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. **The Boring Shit: ETFS - 60%**\n\nI get it, when you had $5000 the concept of putting half of that in an ETF and letting it grow slowly over time had absolutely zero appeal. Turning $2500 into $2650 over a three-month period does absolutely nothing for you. That's money that could go into a play that could have exponentially more upside. You're chasing the dream. It can be hard to get out of that mindset later, it's only after you have gained and lost something substantial that you start to understand the appeal of safe investments like ETFs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow I distribute that capital amongst ETFs is as follows\n\n**SPY - 20% -** SPY is *the* market benchmark. When we are in a seemingly never-ending bull market it just makes sense to have some of your portfolio move along with it. I set a trailing stop loss at 2%. My logic for that number is as follows: at 1% you could cash out on a small dip and could miss out on the potential upside when it goes back up. A 2% drop is much more likely to be a part of a much more significant correction. In that case, there is a much higher chance that I can simply buy back in further down the dip. Alternatively, a 3% trailing stop loss would reduce the risk of me cashing out on a smaller correction and missing the desired entry point back in, but would limit my ability to capitalize on the dip in price. \n\n**QQQ - 60% -** I heavily concentrate into QQQ because it better represents the Tech\/Growth market than the SPY. When I realized nearly every company I was very bullish on fell under this umbrella I decided it was better to invest a chunk of my capital into QQQ rather than opening long positions on like 5 different tech companies. Trailing Stop loss 2% for the same reasons listed above.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe other 20% I distribute between ETFs in other market sectors that I believe are poised to do well. For Example, I am invested in BETZ because I am bullish on the gambling sector, COMB because I am bullish on Commodities, and IPO so I stand to gain from IPOs without having to speculate on companies that haven't yet entered the market. When applicable I wheel these shares with CCs at fairly conservative strikes for a slow drip of premiums while I hold. If options aren't available it's 2% TSL.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**LEAPS - 20%**\n\nI use leaps to maximize potential returns on my long positions more efficiently than shares, but less risky than shorter-term calls. I cap these plays at 10%-20% of my total capital. When searching for a company to go long on I have a few parameters I always follow.\n\n1. Only one company per market sector. - These plays are inherently plays that are trying to beat the market. I pick a market sector I am bullish on and do basic fundamental and technical analysis on a variety of stocks. I try to identify a potential growth play as well as a potential value play. \n2. Only open positions at entry points based on technical analysis - Now I'm not going to try and fool anyone and say that my TA is always perfect, but being consistent with *how* I choose how to enter at least gives me a consistent data set to build off of. If the conditions are never met for entry I simply continue to wait or don't open the position. There's no rush to throw all your money in right away, there's nothing worse than finding a great potential play but having your capital locked up in a shitty meme play you opened.\n3. Always keep an 80-20 ratio between value and growth plays. Value plays have inherently less risk than growth plays long term, as such keeping this segment of my port heavily skewed towards value lowers my overall risk level to some degree. Value plays are usually slower, more consistent winners, making selling calls on top of the LEAPS a viable strategy with significantly less risk of unrealized gains than trying to PMCC a growth play. Another benefit to this is that it makes me be significantly pickier with whatever growth plays I choose to invest in.\n4. Never over-leverage on a Long Position. I never put more than 6% of my capital into any one play. This seemed counter-intuitive to me at first especially since my first 4 months of investing I was 60%+ GME at any given time but it allows me the mental freedom to keep an eye on my entire port rather than staring at one chart because I *need* it to go up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Theta Plays - 15%** \n\n These plays can consist of a variety of different options strategies that I have learned over the past half a year. What plays I choose to enter vary month to month based on the current market conditions.  Theta plays are nice in that there are many different scenarios in that they can be utilized. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDuring earnings season I typically sell CSPs one or two weeks out, always making sure that I close the position before the earnings date. If a meme stock just exploded and IV is through the roof I might open a diagonal call spread in order to leverage the significant difference in theta between weekly and monthly calls with significantly less delta exposure than a typical debit or credit spread. Call credit spreads are used on stocks I am bearish on the short term. I don't take time to search out bearish plays, but if a company I am long on presents a short-term bear pattern it makes sense to open a play on that. This also helps keep me grounded, it becomes easy to want to disregard potential red flags on a stock you are bullish on, but if those red flags start looking like dollar signs you will become much more honest in your analysis. If a stock I am following has been trading sideways for a long period of time I might open an Iron Condor in order to profit on the fact that that shit don't move. The last theta strat I use is 0DTE SPY Put Credit Spreads. These can be done three times a week are pretty safe plays as far as day trades go. If the SPY has a stable bullish trend line going for the day open the spread right underneath that and close it before 3pm.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SPY Calls - 5%**\n\nOnce a retard, always a retard. There are days (like today) where you look at the SPY chart and can't help but buy some FDs. Obviously, this shit is a rare occasion. if I did this every week I'd eventually run out of money. But making sure that I have capital set aside *just in case* means that I don't have to scramble closing positions in the event a big play presents itself.","138":"An unbiased take on the Robinhood IPO: The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly! **Preamble:**  Let\u2019s just say that Robinhood has seen better days. A vast majority of us absolutely hate Robinhood right now. I feel that it\u2019s justified given the blatant disregard they had for retail investors during the GME saga. Adding to this, most of their revenue is driven by the extremely controversial Payment for Order Flow (PFOF) which is currently in the focus of SEC.\n\nBut rational investors do not reject a company completely based on how they feel about the company\u2019s business practices. In an ideal world, capital allocation happens based on alignment with the mission statement and practices of the company, but there\u2019s more than one way to make a profit in the market.\n\nThere are plenty of examples of companies doing extremely well even though they have been in the continuous focus of public ire and legal issues (Think Nestle with their dubious practices, BAC after the Occupy Wall-Street movement, EA with their micro-transactions, and Amazon with worker abuse).\n\nAnd for all the hate Robinhood gets and posts about moving out of Robinhood, just sort the gain\/loss\/yolo posts for the last month in any investing subreddit and you can still see a significant chunk of trades being made through Robinhood.\n\nYou can choose to not use their product, but it\u2019s not financially prudent to reject an investment opportunity without due diligence. All the DDs that I have seen exclusively focus on the negative aspects and then reject the IPO, and I think that\u2019s unfair. Especially given that over the past 20 years, [\\~69% of IPO\u2019s have gained value on listing day with an average increase of 12%.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/ny6wpp\/i_analyzed_3600_ipos_over_the_past_two_decades_to\/)That\u2019s a 12% average gain in just one day!\n\nBasically, what I wanted to know was this \u2013 **Is Robinhood IPO a good investment opportunity?**\n\nSo, strap in while I try to condense 300+ pages of Robinhood S1 and my own views into a 5-minute read on **The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly of Robinhood**.\n\nThe Beginnings\n\nRobinhood had a spectacular launch by any metric. They had [amassed nearly 1 million users](https:\/\/medium.com\/inside-viral-loops\/how-robinhood-got-nearly-1-million-users-before-the-company-even-existed-dfb1a57231f8) before the company even existed by gamifying their beta program. Their promise was very simple. $0 transaction fees for all the trades.\n\n[ ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/x2uft7pjiwc71.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=29f594d10a96fc494640e62171baef195855855e)\n\nFrom the very beginning, [Robinhood had planned to create revenue](https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2013\/12\/18\/zero-commission-stock-trading-robinhood\/?_ga=2.76461904.47963929.1626865862-335952608.1624635175) from\n\na.\u00a0Premium API access\n\nb.\u00a0Trading on margin\n\nc.\u00a0Interest from holding custody of user\u2019s assets\n\nd.\u00a0Payment for order flow\n\n### The Good\n\n**Growth:**\n\n[ ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/t9tg350liwc71.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd626b15048e4b0d63c1a7e5a3a1ae0d00ddf261)\n\nThe company has grown exponentially over the years (even before the meme stock frenzy) with them approximately doubling the funded user base every year. The current retail frenzy only pushed up this growth rate. Adding to this, 80% of the users who joined them in 2020 were through word-of-mouth and Robinhood Referral which enabled them to grow organically. We don\u2019t have enough data to tell how this has changed following the GME scandal, but the one thing we can be sure of is that people are definitely still talking about them. The revenue has also followed suit growing by 309% for the year ended Q1\u201921.\n\n**Profitability \\[1\\]:**\n\n[ ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/sccvtzuliwc71.png?width=472&format=png&auto=webp&s=639fb6255f6298bca22ee6f3d286da79429a9f3b)\n\nIt\u2019s highly unlikely for a company that is growing almost 100% every year to be profitable, especially in the tech world. But Robinhood was briefly profitable in 2020 before having a $1.4B net loss in Q1\u201921 due in part to a $1.5B fair-value adjustment to convertible notes and warrant liability.\n\n**Product:**\n\nIt\u2019s undeniable that they have a very well-designed product suite. It makes it very easy for first-time investors to invest in stocks (this is also reflected in their user base with more than 50% of them being first-time investors). The Robinhood gold monthly subscription program currently has more than 1.4 MM customers. Adding to this, their \\*rypto, cash management, and educational solution combine to create a well-suited ecosystem for first-time investors. The stickiness of the product can easily be seen in the monthly active user numbers.\n\n[ ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/c06u6ksmiwc71.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=52e1b83a70ececce4283513e39f5521d764dbd14)\n\n### The Bad\n\n**Revenue Stability**\n\nRobinhood\u2019s income is highly dependent on retail investors getting into the riskiest investments \u2013 Options, \\*ryptos and Margin. This would be extremely dependent on a highly volatile market that we saw over the past year. Once\/if this settles down, the revenue stream is bound to reduce. This in itself would generate a conflict of interest with Robinhood actively encouraging this risk-taking in the user interface, through [dark patterns and gamifying the experience](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/07\/08\/technology\/robinhood-risky-trading.html).\n\n**Competition**\n\nAlmost all the major competitors who used to charge a per transaction trading fee have now [cut down their commission to zero](https:\/\/money.usnews.com\/investing\/portfolio-management\/articles\/brokers-that-offer-commission-free-trading). While this might not be the only USP of Robinhood, for a new investor coming into the trading ecosystem, Robinhood is not a compelling choice given the controversies surrounding them. The only thing they have going for them with regards to competition is an exceptional user interface, which again is subjective to the user.\n\n**Valuation**\n\nAccording to the [updated prospectus](https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/0001783879\/000162828021013986\/robinhoods-1a1.htm), Robinhood is aiming for an initial price target of $38-42 a share, which would value the firm at $27-35 Billion. The company expects to raise around $2.2 Billion from this IPO. While a high valuation is not unlikely for a tech company, $HOOD is potentially valued now at 37x historical FY 2020 Price-to-Sales or P\/S. This, when compared to Charles Schwab (10.8x) and Tiger brokers (20.1x) is on the higher side. Most probably the justification for such a high valuation is their current trajectory of customer growth and the average age of the customer (younger customers tend to be more valuable over the long run).\n\n### The Ugly\n\n**Payment For Order Flow (PFOF) \u00a0and Regulatory Risks \\[2\\]**\n\nAhh, finally we come to the most controversial part of Robinhood. The irony here is that PFOF was invented by Bernie Madoff. If you want a detailed understanding of PFOF, you can read it [here](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/p\/paymentoforderflow.asp) or [here](https:\/\/a16z.com\/2021\/02\/17\/payment-for-order-flow\/). The TLDR version is\u00a0\n\n>A broker takes your market buy order for 100 shares of Acme, Inc., aggregates it with all the other small Acme buy orders, and sells that to a market maker, who fills the order. The market maker pays your broker for the volume\n\nThe spread between the buy and sell orders are then shared by the market maker (in Robinhood\u2019s case Citadel) and the Brokerage (Robinhood).\n\n[ ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/6dl9gqdoiwc71.png?width=515&format=png&auto=webp&s=c14cda402a97628c136bc66d406d8e1ef41973e2)\n\nAlmost all the major players (except Fidelity) have some amount of revenue coming in from PFOF and this is not necessarily a bad thing. From my understanding, this actually benefits the retail investor by moving the cost of the transaction from the user to the market maker.\n\nBut the main concern for Robinhood here is the amount of revenue they are generating from PFOF.\n\n[ ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/se7aogbpiwc71.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=01521f90aa415d277ebb372996cbf212544676b4)\n\nFor Q1\u201921, 81% of the company\u2019s revenue came from transaction-based revenue (PFOF). In contrast, PFOF contributes [less than 20% for TD Ameritrade](https:\/\/dashboards.trefis.com\/data\/companies\/AMTD\/no-login-required\/0P4oc9vg\/TD-Ameritrade-Revenues-How-Does-Ameritrade-Make-Money-) and Charles Schwab. Adding to the high risk of having more than 80% of revenue from one source, Robinhood has been repeatedly fined for not having the customer\u2019s best interest in mind.\n\n\u00b7\u00a0FINRA fined HOOD $1.25M in 2019 for not getting customers the best prices\n\n\u00b7\u00a0FINRA announced that Robinhood would pay a record $70M in fines and restitution over the outages and Robinhood agreed to the settlement.\n\n\u00b7\u00a0They are facing more than [90 lawsuits after the GameStop trading halt](https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2021\/02\/17\/robinhood-faces-lawsuits-after-gamestop-trading-halt.html)\n\n\u00b7\u00a0Finally, SEC chairman Gary Gensler has said that not every country allows PFOF and they are going to take a closer look into PFOF.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nRobinhood started off with an extremely promising idea and then dropped the ball at its most important moment. Undoubtedly, they are going to report a blowout Q2 earnings report shortly following the listing and the stock is going to pump (They would have made a killing with the Dog\\*coin rally in April and May and other meme stock rallies such as AMC\/CLOV in Q2\u201921).\n\nAnother interesting insight that we could make from their Q2 report when it\u2019s announced is if they had any net user attrition following the scandal. The age-old saying of \u201cany publicity is good publicity \u201c would be put to test! If they still maintained their growth story with AUM and active user base increasing consistently, that would be impressive, and we would know that the investor sentiment that we are seeing now is not actually translating to lost business.\n\nWe might need to re-evaluate this analysis once the IPO is over and they have announced their Q2 report and the market has settled down. But right now, given that we have an overall picture of the company and how they make money, **I feel that the risk factors far outweigh any potential listing gains that you could make**!\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n\\[1\\] It\u2019s extremely hard to be objective when the company keeps on trying to pull one over you. The following chart is from Robinhood\u2019s official filing to SEC. They have shown +7MM and -57MM net income as the same size (that red line is the same length in both). Note that the losses are also shown in green and the scale is completely off. The actual scale can be found in the post.\n\n[ ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/5lk9oppqiwc71.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=5908ee207b1cbc278f53185cc9b6656b22e8a8ae)\n\n\\[2\\] Fun fact: The risk factor section in the S1-Filing is 75 pages long and over 52,000 words. No wonder their Chief Legal Officer Daniel Gallagher (Ex-SEC Commissioner) got that $30 million bonus.\n\n*As always, please note that I am not a financial advisor.*\u00a0Hope you enjoyed this week\u2019s analysis.","139":"\ud83d\udc9a Andy on EV Charge Stocks: I Like $EVGO a lot, and it's on sale today!

EVgo has the balance of cost-to-install and utility-to-drivers figured out, which is absolutely key to scaling in this industry.\n\n**I don't like $CHPT** \\- I think it's a trap because the product is not very useful in real life, despite being \u201c#1 largest EVSE network in the US\u201d. The more I unravel, the more I realize that this network is more about raising money\/valuation than it is about charging cars and getting drivers on their way.\n\n**BG & Motivation**\n\nPeople will need to charge their cars, and EV adoption is climbing big time, so it seems like investing in charge stations is a great bet, as long as you invest in the right one!\n\nThis idea started because I actually wanted to own my own charge station in a strip mall.. or a Wendy\u2019s parking lot\u2026 or something. My research into that taught me enough about the material costs of electricians and permits\u2026 and thus I have pivoted into trying to buy charge station stock, instead of a physical charge station. (If anyone knows how I can own my own commercial EVSE in strip malls in NJ, please message me! I am interested!)\n\n**Who am I? \\[I try to restrict being a shill to this section\\]**\n\nEveryone is presumed a shill posting investment advice here. Here is my stake: I own and operate a 1-man car lease brokerage LLC. I help connect people that want to lease new Hyundai Cars & SUVs (Electric, Gas, and Hybrid) to authorized dealerships that have those cars at fair prices. I post content (including price guidelines) on car buying\/leasing forums to better educate prospective customers on market conditions when it comes to leasing their new ride. Beyond that, customers can text me, where I charge a $249 brokerage fee to provide a more personal level of service, and an escalation point outside of the dealership. You may have seen enough \u201cdealership horror stories\u201d to understand why I may have a place in the new car market. Frankly, my level of pricing\/process transparency is unique in the US market for new Hyundai vehicles. All that aside, this post isn\u2019t about getting you in a new car today.. it\u2019s about profiting off of charging your car in the future, whatever you buy\/lease and wherever you buy\/lease it from.\n\n**If you look at how important Gas prices have been to the economy\u2026 it\u2019s a no-brainer that EV charging is going to be big money.**\n\nMore chargers will be a necessity, and the lack of enough fast chargers is a potential bottleneck to seeing more new EVs join the road. If there is nowhere to charge the cars, I\u2019m worried that I will lose opportunities to connect prospective customers to new EVs. As an EV driver myself, I find EVgo to be the most convenient app and station network to find a charger, and so I bought a heavy position in CLII before the merger. Today, I bought more as the stock dipped below $11 again!\n\n**Why EVgo is the Best Charge Network for Consumers.**\n\nEVGO stations are, on average, and by my approximation, 30-50x more expensive to install, but charge a car 7x faster \u2013 compared to the average Chargepoint Station. Over 100 miles of range per hour, vs 25 miles of range per hour (again this is on average \u2013 most of Chargepoint\u2019s stations are Level 2).\n\nElectrify America (Volkswagen) does have a few faster stations that are, on average, 100x more expensive to install than ChargePoint Level 2 stations, or 3x+ more expensive to install than EVGO stations. Those stations can charge compatible cars, even faster, [as fast as 160 miles in 22 minutes](https:\/\/media.electrifyamerica.com\/en-us\/releases\/75). but I believe the infrastructure costs will keep those stations at designated sites, major interstates, etc.\n\nEVGO provides that \u201cSweet spot\u201d where its feasible to deploy to the average American strip mall, 50kW charge stations in more places. Per Forbes: [https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/bradtempleton\/2020\/07\/09\/the-future-of-ev-charging-may-be-at-50kw-not-the-gasoline-thinking-of-250kw](https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/bradtempleton\/2020\/07\/09\/the-future-of-ev-charging-may-be-at-50kw-not-the-gasoline-thinking-of-250kw)\n\nAs an EV Driver, it is delightful to pull up to a station that is conveniently near the shops\/business\/attraction you already want to go to, and know your car can add 100 miles of range per hour while you\u2019re parked running your errands. In my opinion, in this business, it\u2019s not about a race to having the fastest charge station in the middle of nowhere where you have to watch Netflix in your car. This is what EVGO gets right, consumer-facing. Fast enough charging in the right places.\n\n**Why EVGO makes sense as an Investment to Me.**\n\nIn addition to a superior charging network, and partnerships with major automotive players, the executive leadership at EVGO has strong ties to the Biden Administration. Biden recently test drove the all-electric F150 with a big smile on his face, so I\u2019m going with the political climate of EVs and EV charge stations to be healthy. Biden also visited an EVgo station recently.\n\nMy philosophy is that even if this dips, people will \\*need\\* to charge their cars, and there\u2019s no way it\u2019s not a solid long-term play. This stock doubled in price when the EVGO\/CLII merger was first announced, but now it\u2019s basically back down to its original valuation, which is what made me feel that now is the time to strike again.\n\nAdditional Facts:\n\n* EVGO is the only 3rd party charge network that displays its own logo in-Dash on charging Teslas (due to partnership with Tesla)\n* EVGO only builds new stations that will be cash-flow positive in 7 years or less, based on their model of EV adoption in given locales.\n\n**Why CHPT is Annoying for Consumers.**\n\nThe problem with Chargepoint is two-fold.\n\n1. Most of their chargers are sloowwww.. but labeled as \u201cLevel 2 fast chargers\u201d (25 miles of range added to your car, per hour plugged in)\n2. \u201cFind a Charger\u201d apps\/GPS\/etc don\u2019t always differentiate charger types when routing, frequently directing EV drivers to shit stations that leave them stranded in parking lots for extreme amounts of time. Frequently, the driver thinks they are going to a \u201cfast charger\u201d \u2013 but their definition of Fast is very different from Chargepoint\u2019s definition of fast.\n\nThe advantage of Chargepoint is: it\u2019s simple & cheap to install. You just need a 240V 40A circuit, such as one for a dryer or air compressor, to add a Chargepoint to your existing building\/lot. If you want to charge faster than this, you need 480V three-phase power. The difference in investment-to-install goes from a $10k job to install one charger to a $300k+ job to install one charger.\n\nThe result is Chargepoint advertises this massive network of chargers, but in reality they\u2019re only useful if they\u2019re at.. say.. a hotel.. where your car will be plugged in overnight. You see these things at supermarkets and hospitals and at strip malls all over, but they only recoup 20-30 miles of range while you\u2019re in the store running your errands, basically negating any benefit after circling a parking lot and finding one to plug in. You also see a bunch of small Boomer town halls getting excited about \u201cbeing part of the future\u201d for installing one ChargePoint L2 [charger](https:\/\/www.kingston-ny.gov\/evstations) in a [municipal](https:\/\/www.kioskmarketplace.com\/news\/connecticut-town-installs-ev-charging-station\/) lot somewhere.\n\nThe best example I can give is, on two different occasions I got stuck on a Chargepoint. My destination was 100 or 200 miles away, but I only had about 30 miles of range left on my car. The nearest Chargepoint was 25 miles away, and the nearest DC Fast Charger was about 50 miles away. I could not make it to the Fast Charger, so I had to divert to a Chargepoint. Since the Chargepoint was a detour, I needed to sit at the Chargepoint to recoup 40 miles of range before I\u2019d be able to make it to the fast charger. So I spent 90 minutes in a hospital parking lot in the middle of nowhere. Then, my car had just enough range to drive to the nearest fast charger. Once I got to the fast charger, another 90 minutes added 300 miles of range to my car. But still, because I was 10 miles short on range getting there, I had no option but to add nearly 3 hours of detour. Over 80% of Chargepoints are useless for getting you any further than the next charging station. Consumers expect the average charge station to perform 10-12x faster than what most of Chargepoint\u2019s fleet provides! (And 10-12x faster than Chargepoint is still a lot slower than getting Gas)\n\n**Why Reddit Has Made me Think CHPT is Also a Scheme.. Financially**\n\nSo this part is inspired by Reddit. I noticed during the height of the GME volatility that there really was enough evidence of some of these \u201cpopular\u201d blogs pushing an anti-GME shill agenda type of thing. I saw that Cramer interview and I took a step back and realized that it did make sense that the companies buying Google Ads to hype stocks might have a financial stake in those values. And sure enough, when you Google for NYSE:CHPT, those same type of sites come up: StockNews, SeekingA\\*pha, InvestorPlace, Motley Fool, etc. These guys are pumping CHPT, and so this is where I can see this alleged shill-blog behavior (could be either ignorant or dishonest) in a market and landscape I actually understand the fundamentals of.\n\nI think about being stuck for 90 minutes at a Chargepoint to add 40 miles of range to make it to an Electrify America where 90 minutes added 300 miles of range and took me home, and I call bullshit on these Pro-$CHPT articles. Thank you, Reddit, and thank you to those sites themselves that tipped off the general public at how they work during the period of peak GME-volatility. That historical information gives me confidence in asking this \\*opinion\\*, and shower thought, \u201cWhat if a large Chargepoint shareholder actually tried to use a Chargepoint Station, got stranded or inconvenienced on the side of the road, and realized that this needs to pump\/dump to get out, thus paying for some media coverage to hype the stock?\u201d\n\nI just don\u2019t want to buy $CHPT because the service isn\u2019t useful to me. The question I\u2019d love to ask anyone that owns that stock is, is the service useful to you? Have you used it to charge your electric car?\n\n**A point on Electrify America (main competitor of EVgo growth)**\n\nWhat not everyone knows is that **Electrify America is a wholly owned subsidiary of Volkswagen, and its existence is punitive, as a result of the Dieselgate settlement**.\n\nThe Electrify America stations are awesome, but also very costly to deploy. 150kW charging needs really beefy transformers and electrical equipment to charge your car that fast. On interstates, 150kW and 350kW charging will be king. But on the more local level, in malls and supermarket and movie theater parking lots, EVGO can install 50kW stations at a fraction of the cost of what VW Group is installing 150kW EA stations at. Electrify America is also a bit of a showcase of the technology, and enables VW to sell more cars like the Porsche Taycan to compete with Tesla. Their end-game is more about interstates than about around-town EV charging. EA\u2019s pricing is also currently regulated as a result of the whole dieselgate fiasco, whereas EVGO\u2019s pricing is not regulated, and the charge station owner is free to mark up the electricity.\n\n**Final Point: EVSEs are more like ATMs than Gas Stations.**\n\nI believe that the EVGO model will ultimately follow the ATM model. An enterprising company will put one in every parking lot that makes sense until there is saturation. At that point, rent and rates can be negotiated between the business\/utility\/ATM owner. Gas Stations are more standalone, whereas the sell of EVSEs is putting them in places that make strategic sense \u2013 where people are already driving and spending 45-120 minutes in one place.\n\nIn Summary, I like $EVGO. I don't like $CHPT. And if you haven\u2019t yet: Try driving an electric car! They\u2019re so much fun to drive as long as you can find a place to charge!\n\nThank you for reading!\n\n\ud83d\udc9a Andy","140":"Forecasted earnings for the most popular WSB tickers: $GME $AMC $BB $PSFE $SOFI $SPCE $TSLA $AMD $NVDA $CLF Here are the forecasted earnings for the most popular WSB tickers:\n\n$GME\n\n[$GME](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/bxxkkkltkra71.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=c64fc0fa4e84c534969a44b8a23b25c3fec4cbc4)\n\n$AMC\n\n[$AMC](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/q93ws41jmra71.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=13d6905852aefe27f427de317e40a95502d66b23)\n\n$BB\n\n[$BB](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/tn8o9b3vmra71.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ab85ab32c07143644924dcc6e9b5d4d0be5b62b)\n\n$PSFE\n\n[$PSFE](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/8pt0vb9lnra71.png?width=1066&format=png&auto=webp&s=d9f83182587183b9495c2d0f66084b8e14094533)\n\n$SOFI\n\n[$SOFI](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/xt1rdewpnra71.png?width=950&format=png&auto=webp&s=29d61006c33eb05378f27dce11015ced68e1be8b)\n\n$SPCE\n\n[$SPCE](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/19o8gsi4ora71.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=050256f4cfcebff544bcce5112c3439f73d537c0)\n\n$TSLA\n\n[$TSLA](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/w7jp2z1yora71.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=53a4ef02156d73a05ac0fcd963ba75787e2540ba)\n\n$AMD\n\n[$AMD](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/lggjzxq6pra71.png?width=1364&format=png&auto=webp&s=a093d0922d251e9947b6733ef4a7e5b094d47931)\n\n$NVDA\n\n[$NVDA](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/je39qa9epra71.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc40ef31a1872f0f04e5eb7d7dce11da5ddad462)\n\n$CLF\n\n[$CLF](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/2k6x4gn9qra71.png?width=1159&format=png&auto=webp&s=e887d16dbd19b772b1d5b739521aedac1c5feeca)\n\n*Source:* Refinitiv Eikon\n\nI will include additional tickers upon your request.\n\nNow go lose some money, you retards\n\nEDIT\n\n$CLNE\n\n[$CLNE](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/rqj6rdd8sra71.png?width=1362&format=png&auto=webp&s=56c5bad66bd32b4a4b29ada90dd7e9652d44fdbf)\n\n$AAPL\n\n[$AAPL](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/5c6cspehcta71.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=78df98dc28c428bfe2dbe40c3a6cebc488965fdf)\n\n$WKHS\n\n[$WKHS](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/swirc6hlcta71.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d5c08d804c5461548ded8ac9f11bb087eb16859)\n\n$WISH\n\n[$WISH](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/9pyjpr5pcta71.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=0153cde0f8ccf06ab7bf6ac349aacb103f533820)","141":"A practical template for understanding and trading bear market moves.

A month ago I gave you some insight into how small my penis is by sharing my template of [broad bear market moves, based on 100 yrs of bear markets](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/ny8u84\/all_crashes_are_similar_only_perceptions_change\/).  In this post I'll further display my boyhood by getting to the specific swings and trades I tend to find in a bear market move.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's the template we're going to be using.

Move into some more recent examples where I can show you my real time forecasts on the moves as they were posted and then we'll round it off giving some forward looking examples so you can tell me how fucking stupid I am if they don't work out.\n\nWe used the same basic structure [in the last post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/ny8u84\/all_crashes_are_similar_only_perceptions_change\/), leaving the forward looking forecast that AMC would be rejected and begin to fall off of the 60 level.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe'll kick things off with everyone's favourite car stock, Ford (This statement would have been true at some point in history...)\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/vnp252x0wea71.png?width=1727&format=png&auto=webp&s=2fb5b64df0a3771188f26ae19169156cbfb4df41\n\nSo up until about 2000 F was a stonk!

There are two chinese guys who own most of the shares outstanding Zhitao He and Fred Chang, owning approximately 60.91% and 35.98%, collectively 96.90% of the company,  so Zhitao owns about  224,394,452 shares and Fred owns about 130,724,530 shares. The shareholders of Newegg before the merger own  1.31% of shares outstanding, so 4,759,564. Leaving the public float  1.79%, aka 6,503,527.

How squeezy is it? Well I came across this company doing a completely different analysis. I was interested in failure-to-deliver data that the SEC provides and what it could tell me. You see recently there have been alot of seemingly random stocks popping. Me and some others share the opinion that it\u2019s due to NSCC-2021-002 being implemented a couple weeks ago, and rule DTCC-2021-005  being implemented a couple months ago. See [this thread](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/jn_ku\/comments\/m4fnfg\/gamestop_moass_no_tinfoil_hat_required\/) to see it\u2019s significance for all the meme\u2019s we know and love. So I got all the FTD data from the SEC from 08\/2020 - 06\/2021 (1st half of June) from the [SEC\u2019s website](https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/data\/foiadocsfailsdatahtm), and calculated FTD\/Float for all the meme stocks we know and love, and some rando stocks that popped recently as well. For $NEGG I calculated the float to be the midpoint of average of the two number, 3m.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[i meant 6\\\/15\\\/2021  whoops](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/vypk6jmnzt971.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d2574130393469dc40d032dbd92d62d9aff4ef0)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[i meant 6\\\/15\\\/2021  whoops](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/a6mvd6nnzt971.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=b6ede5517207f88c05781718371d6ec37428b6a6)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI gave the outliers colors, and all the other stocks grey scale. So yup your hunch is correct shit has become more volatile after cooling down a bit after the GME squeeze. Outliers usually are the most volatile stocks, GME\/AMC  ftd data was screaming \u201clook at me\u201d before the actual pop in shortly after. $NEGG is screaming the same thing right now.\n\nLet\u2019s consider Ortex data and its relation to FTDs. Ortex doesn\u2019t have a API and if it did I don\u2019t have time to look at it so I\u2019m doing a spot check. So let\u2019s pick a random stock say $SENS\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/hnrmnlyozt971.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=4babb5f83a72ccdb9fcf1470c7beb0b6090f8d04\n\nThe average loan age hit one of it\u2019s peaks on June 7th at 54.23days,  so a good amount of loans were taken out on around April 14  (*54days before June 7th*). Go back to the FTD graph search for $SENS, the peak of \\* \\`FTD as a percentage of Float\\` almost exactly lines up\\*. Let\u2019s try another one, $GME.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/bf9dy4rpzt971.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4e2186f0090584cb6efa7aa170577533fcc5f18\n\nPeak of average loan age at Jan 25 2021 of 85days, placing the date on Nov 25th, the FTD graph shows this as well. Ok, last one let\u2019s check $UWMC\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/8jm3pzeqzt971.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2219785964acacb666a42e2e77e707838a59a93\n\n$UWMC had a peak of avg loan age on Jun 10th, subtract 41days from that day and you get April 29th lining up pretty well with $UWMC largest FTD spike.\n\nOk so I\u2019m basically saying that for stocks without data on ortex you can get a sense of where the shorts have opened positions by looking at the peaks of ftds. I only checked stocks with relatively large peaks as a percentage of float idk about others. So basically for $NEGG there has been a considerable amount of short positions opened May 15 - Jun 15, these guys are underwater.\n\nNext notice that GME FTD spike wasn\u2019t the day that the tendie god turned on the money printer that magical January, it was actually in November. Every stock that has reach GME level of \\`FTD % of Float\\` moons later, the spike never really lines up with the dildo to heaven. It could happen a week later, months later, days later, but it seems that for the outliers its going to happen. $NEGG is in the middle of a squeeze and its FTD spike rival stocks that have gone +200 to +400% during the moonshot. The smaller the float and the higher the spike, the more the pop. I haven\u2019t quantified this.\n\nIf you checked interactive brokers during the day you would have noticed that $NEGG had 0 shares available to short, and the borrow rate is >50%. At peak squeeze borrow rate usually spikes >100%. Lastly, in the last two days the short volume ratio has gone up by a factors & volume has gone up as well\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/k32u8odrzt971.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8700f42420fd701af7899bffd6551844984163d\n\nOne thing I failed to mention is that the stock is already expensive to buy -- $20 -- ensuring that doubling down on shorting requires substantial capital. Looking at iborrowdesk.com we see that nice juicy slow creep up of borrow rate, and reduction of shares available to borrow, while the price slow bleeds up. So $negg is expensive to double down on and it expensive to borrow. Now look at your fave stock that has squeezed borrow rate   > 100% rn $negg borrow is a moderate \\[50%? Need check\\]. So basically what I\u2019m saying is that $NEGG is in the beginning to mid part of a squeeze. Not a squeeze perpetuated by a hardened group of loyalist and propelled by whales. A squeeze caused by a <3.5m shares float, while all the exchanges having the wrong information, the realization is happening that there were barely any shares to begin with. This will be like a bank run, and I don\u2019t have a logical price target. It could go up to $70.\n\nLastly, for squeezes price instability is needed aka liquidity is drying up. If you\u2019ve been watching the intraday movements at all, with wide bid\/ask spreads and limited orderbook. This plus increases in historic volatility indicated price instability\/liquidity drying up.\n\nLiquidity\/ price instability is one of the main characteristics in which you can identify a squeeze; in general it indicate future volatility either a big move up or down, (too many buyers smashing the ask button, or too many sellers smashing the bid button) but we have enough information to identify the direction\n\nSee this wrinklebrain comments for more info about liquidity:\n\n* [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/maxjustrisk\/comments\/o37n9h\/weekend\\_discussion\\_jun\\_19\\_20\/h2idegc?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/maxjustrisk\/comments\/o37n9h\/weekend_discussion_jun_19_20\/h2idegc?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n* [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/maxjustrisk\/comments\/o83chk\/weekend\\_discussion\\_jun\\_26\\_27\/h39t83c?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/maxjustrisk\/comments\/o83chk\/weekend_discussion_jun_26_27\/h39t83c?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nNote that if I had something better than thinkorswim I would be looking for the barcoding [candlestick pattern](https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=barcoding+stocks&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS908US908&oq=barcoding+&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0j46i175i199j0l7.2849j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) oh well, have close enough approximations that indicate that its happening.\n\n*Asking around for ActiveTick data to see if this pattern exists, to be continued\u2026.*\n\n# Technicals\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/as1fpqlszt971.png?width=1193&format=png&auto=webp&s=513c1003e2662c1276386a8c019371a931b23708\n\nThis Cup and Handle makes me get a little chubby dude.\n\n# Fundamentals\n\nThis is the part i care least about,but it feels good to not yolo on a shit company (sorry $RIDE hodlers).\n\nNewegg has been a one stop shop for PC building for years.

I love Newegg as a company, and I'm freaking amped that they're public, so full disclosure, I've got biases. That being said, I think it's a solid buy. It seems only one analyst has really put a price target on it. I don't know who the analyst is, but any google search for a price target pings back the same, beautiful, 44$ prediction, spread across all of our favorite market commentators. (WSJ, Market Watch, Yahoo) If that's not enough to get you excited, we go to their financials. In 2016 they made a measly 13M$. 2017 came around, and they made an abysmal 1M$. 2018, though? 2.15B$. Mind you, they went from making 1Million dollars... to 2.1 BBillion. 2019, and 2020 were both in the 2 Billion dollar range. (Via WSJ) And now? GPU prices are inflated to high hell, son! Despite that, Newegg seems to be able to Earnings announcement is going to be fantastic! Lastly, let's take a look at technicals. Yesterday and the day before, NEGG had a huge run up! Literally having doubled its price at one point. (Ran from 10$ to 21$ before coming back down.) In that time, it showed strong support at 13. I thought we might see 13$ again today. Besides that, it showed support yesterday, at it's first dip, at 15$, bounced from there up to 19.5, before getting rejected. After it's rejection, it showed support at 16.75 for AH\/PM, at 15.75$ for the intraday low. AND THEN IT BOUNCED BACK TO 17.75! If we break down under 15$, We might see 13$, again. Right now, it's gearing up to retest 21$. A rejection from that will likely put us back in this 17.75 range. If we break that 21$ resistance? Then we might get a test of 22$. We might see another gamma squeeze as brokers start hedging for the 22.5$ Calls.\n\n*(btw he\u2019s off about the gamma sqz; options just got introduced, everything else is interesting)*\n\nIt also has some recent good news: [https:\/\/www.tomshardware.com\/news\/neweggs-new-pc-building-service-might-hold-stock-on-rare-components-behind-pre-assembly-paywall](https:\/\/www.tomshardware.com\/news\/neweggs-new-pc-building-service-might-hold-stock-on-rare-components-behind-pre-assembly-paywall)\n\n# Positions\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/no2woixuzt971.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=04fa15e546fc8ae511df1879c0e5833437cdf097\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ykjovwnvzt971.png?width=1538&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca9370ca929c3ecec2f8b46ad4bbeb70c711442e\n\nI\u2019m risky af probably better positions out there, took out 20k yesterday (Jul 6, 2021), positions above are as of of pre-market July 7.\n\nThe 13 $30 calls bought Jul 6, 2021for about $3 a pop, end of day they were $6.3, high of $8.1.

I'm probably going to get a lot of downvotes, but I'm going to be straight up honest here.\n\nWe are not a team, this is not a cult, and this is not fucking collusion.\n\nGME, AMC, & CLOV are three completely different plays. Stop fucking comparing the 3 with this cult like attitude.\n\n**GME** \\- Was being shorted because as per \"technicals\" it was a company that was going to shit (bankruptcy) if they didn't change leadership and incorporate strategic changes to their business model aka E-Commerce and the like. Additionally, the biggest reason GME picked up in late December\/early January is because it had a ridiculous\/unprecedented short interest of %140. Making the short squeeze extremely likely to occur. The stock picked up, gamma squeeze and short squeezes occurred and it's still the play to this day. Why? because the remaining \\~15-20% short sellers still holding their positions are the same ones from the beginning who have accumulated billions in loses, thus still considered a major play + the company making big changes to their board of directors, adding e-commerce and more etc.\n\n**AMC** \\- This stock sucked dick when it was first picked up. The only reason this stock got picked up was because of nostalgia and because of people missing out on GME. The SI% on AMC back when GME rallied up was well below 20%. This company as well was on the verge of bankruptcy. It got picked up by the supporters like us apes and more shorts loaded in. AMC due to the retail investors \"Picking\" this stock to rally up actually has started to work on their business model and accrued $1B in investments and has started to really concentrate on building the business into a success (hopefully). When the CEO said the talks of bankruptcy are no longer on the table, is because even they knew at the time that filing for bankruptcy was a real possibility for the company. Again, the CEO has fucked over investors in the past by trying to continually dilute the float with adding more shares. On top of that prior to the stocks rallying up the board and CEO's paid themselves handsomely when the company was about to fail. Now, the narrative is different for AMC as the shorts that are in this stock are the same ones from the beginning and have also accrued unrealized losses. Also, seems the company has really pivoted to reconstruct their business model to become a success once COVID-19 is no longer hindering the world from being normal again, thus, making AMC still a very big play.\n\n**CLOV** \\- Was ridiculously shorted the moment it hit IPO. This had nothing to do with GME or AMC. The short interest on CLOV has been there since IPO. The play for CLOV is that it's a Medicare Advantage Disruptor, and provides a real use case and a cost effective solution to the traditional Medicare Advantage sub-segment that hasn't changed in ages. This stock has a large short interest, now probably greater then AMC and GME combined, low float, no debt, and has a very bright future for growth. It's also heavily invested by Alphabet (Google) and other major players. The firms shorting CLOV are not the same as those who shorted GME and AMC, separate that from your minds.\n\nYes, Melvin Capital, Citadel and others targeted GME and AMC, but this has no relevance to CLOV. No one gives a fuck, a viable stock that has a potential to disrupt a market segment that is also heavily shorted is the play for CLOV. That's it, simple as that.\n\nAll 3 of these stocks are completely different plays. Yes, a short squeeze and\/or gamma squeeze will always be appreciated on any stock. But get this through your heads, THEY ARE NOT THE SAME PLAY! They are completely different in respect to each other.\n\nWSB is a casino, we're here to place bets and hope for the best. This is not a team sport, this is not a cult, and this is not collusion.\n\nIf you don't like a stock, then don't throw money at it. But stop with the shilling and the cult attitude predominantly from GME and AMC diehards that can't grasp that WSB is a casino and not a subreddit solely about GME or AMC. (I'm not talking about GME and AMC holders as a whole, most of you are chill af, just some that are constantly shilling everything with a ticker thats not GME or AMC).\n\nNow with this shit said, I'm a big supporter of all 3. But for fuck sakes they are not the same play, stop comparing the 3.\n\nDon't forget AMC dropped to $6 and AMC bagholders were bag holding for months before it moved. GME dropped to $40 and GME holders were bag holding for months before it moved.\n\nEveryone needs to chill the fuck out, play your plays and keep it moving. Stop shilling shit and comparing shit when they're not correlated at all.\n\nBB and NOK became \"Meme\" stocks because fundamentally, they were undervalued for what the company actually does and where they're positioning themselves for the future.\n\nPeople just need to stop comparing and having these debates. 3 stocks, 3 completely different plays, fuck off and throw your money at which ever stocks you like and hope for the best, just stop with the comparisons and cult shit it's ridiculous.\n\nAlso, the short squeeze is nowhere near in sight. You think the short sellers are dumb as fuck? They're going to wait until inflation hits and fucks up the whole market. They're probably betting that once the market goes tits up, people bag holding these stocks will sell, why? Because they anticipate people will need to pay for bills, mortgages\/rent, their children etc, and with the cost of living, cost of commodities inflating due to inflation, I can easily see how they're going to hold onto their positions (shorting these stocks) until this occurs. They're banking that when shit goes tits up, the investors in these stocks will also go tits up and FUD will kick in causing massive selloffs. (My personal opinion).\n\nSome plays on WSB are value plays, short squeeze plays, gamma squeeze plays, undervalued plays, oversold plays, etc the fucking list goes on.\n\nWSB is a god damn casino, so treat it as such. I wish you all the best and many tendies, regardless of what you're invested in. Downvote me to oblivion, idgaf.\n\n**Important update**: I want to say thanks to everyone for the awards, upvotes and comments.\n\nI want to clarify some FUD here after the traction from this post. When I was referring to \\~15-20% short sellers for GME I **was not** referring to short interest or the \"naked\" shorts everyone is talking about. Simply, that the original short sellers that are still in their positions haven't closed out their positions yet, same goes for AMC, and the big MOASS that everyone is mentioning is not what I meant when I said gamma squeeze or short squeezes. I was simply referring to when GME spiked to $438 and months after again to $330. I wasn't talking about the big MOASS.\n\nI've been on WSB since December 2020 but only joined on January 28th, 2021 when I felt like I wanted to start to contribute myself. I was here before there was 500k members. I used to only use reddit to view posts and discussion and never really felt the need to create an account until I found stock\/investment subreddits etc. Hopefully this clears some shit up. Again, the purpose of this post was to explain why these 3 stocks are not the same and shouldn't be compared to each other and for people to stop shilling others and having this \"cult\" like attitude\/behaviour.\n\nOh! and the reason why my post mentions GME, AMC, CLOV is because it was the 3 top tickers on the thread for the day this post was made, 07\/06\/2021.\n\nCheers,","144":"The Weekly DD - Full Robinhood (HOOD) S-1 Analysis and Breakdown **Overview**\n\nAs infamous as Robinhood may be, the company has seen solid growth over the last 6 quarters. This growth, lead by covid lockdowns and the rise of the Gamestop saga most likely sped up the process of the average Joe becoming acclimatized to trading from their pocket.\n\nAlthough this growth was unexpected, there was another phenomenon that set Robinhood up for the layup. This was the fact that the average retail trader is becoming more and more educated on trading equities, options, and crypt0currencies. What was once a risky thing to do has now become almost standardized in a short period of time. Let\u2019s go through some of the key-stats for the company.\n\n**Business Model**\n\nThe full range of what \u201cRobinhood Markets\u201d (RHM) does is structured into 3 subsidiaries: Robinhood Financial (RHF), Robinhood Securities (RHS), and Robinhood Crypt0 (RHC).

They are growing incredibly fast on all key stats and metrics that include cumulative funded accounts, monthly active users, and net assets under custody. To put things in perspective in a stellar 2020 they did roughly 1 billion in revenues and so far in Q1 2021 alone they\u2019ve already done 522 million (on pace for 2 billion revenues for fiscal year 2021). Their bottom-line is teetering between net-profitability and net-loss and management has said it is uncertain which side of the coin net revenues will fall on in future quarters (short-term).\n\nHaving said that, from the S-1 management also see\u2019s growth continuing with a large share of the market still being un-tapped. Their biggest opportunities lie in the fact that 60% of Americans do not trade outside of their retirement accounts and majority of young-adults aged 18-29 still do not invest at all (the median customer age is 31 years old). Robinhood also has a lot of room to grow in international markets, mainly Europe and Asia.\n\nGoing off the data from previous years and looking at how Robinhood scales as they grow. It seems that on average for every $1 in revenue the company grows in scale, operating expenses will increase by approximately 75 cents. The most notable *increase* in expense for Robinhood has been their technological and development expense. This is understandable as the company has been scrutinized for when their services have gone down at seemingly inconvenient times for retail traders.\n\nLastly, the biggest risk for Robinhood is their PFOF component which constitutes nearly 75% of total revenue. Robinhood\u2019s business model relies on PFOF and any regulation on that segment would put their business at risk.\n\nPositions: None because the stock is not listed yet.","145":"A different kind of post - Classic narrative Lately a new narrative has taken over the interwebz.\n\nInstead of investing in innovation and entrepreneurship, it is researching which stocks have heavy short interest and creating a movement to exploit this in order to create explosive growth.\n\nThe technique is clear and obvious.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.\n\nNow onto the classic part of this post:\n\nEvery day I check a list of equities.  I don't pretend to think this is a great list or even a good list but it's my list hah\n\nI first look at Tesla (I still think it is over valued but I like to see how it tracks).\n\nI then look at Ride, NKLA, QS.  NKLA in my opinion being the trash of trash and a great example of how a bull market can keep anything afloat Lol\n\nThen I go to Pltr, Peloton, Bmbl, Door Dash, Uber, Lyft, Airbnb, Snowflake.\n\nThen I go to Nakd, and Fold.\n\nThen I check out some classics like Pfizer, AT&T, Coca-Cola.  I weirdly like to look at Moderna.\n\nThen I check out Endeavour Group Holdings, Coinbase, Thredup, Walkme.\n\nThen I check out Canopy.\n\nThen BB, AMC, GME.\n\nThen SLV, GLD.\n\nThen Trillium, CRISPR.\n\nThen onto the coins.\n\nThen RKT and SPCE.\n\nIt is a weird routine I have each and every day almost.\n\nI think it provides a good exposure to a various class of equities sometimes by groups, sometimes by weird segments of the investing sphere.  \n\nI think everything is insanely priced and way to high hah but we are in the everything bubble so that is what it is.\n\nAll in all the classic narrative is that it provides me a good understanding of what is happening in the various big blocks of the investing world.  Also through google finance I get some good recommends on companies that I don't know about that maybe I will like based on that list and then I expand it sometimes.\n\nCompanies like CRISPR being the things I want to invest in for a better world.  Despite that I am not touching any of this shit with a 10 foot poll based on the pricing and our current market.\n\nWhat equities would you add to look at and why.\n\nI'd love to know what your lists are and the reasoning you like to track those particular sets of equities and such. :)\n\nLet the shit throwing begin as I know many of you identify as apes but I still like to identify as the evolution known as human.","146":"GME and GOEV charts look eerily similar the past 3 months If you overlap GME and GOEV's 6 month chart, it looks like they follow the same pattern since the end of March.\n\nGOEV: Blue\n\nGME: Orange\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/4ej8j0sga1871.png?width=1916&format=png&auto=webp&s=d7f33925af3ac781047d2bba5a0b5cbc1f937f86\n\nBefore March, the price action is completely unrelated.

People are asking for my position screenshot so here you go. Best of luck to everyone who's already jumped in. Spread the good word about LZB as far wide as you can. Let's make next week LZB week on Wall Street.\n\nHello everyone,\n\nI just made an options play yesterday on LZB (La-Z-Boy) that I think is very exciting so I'll share it here.\n\nI bought:\n\n$45 call options exp July '21\n\nCurrent stock price is $37.85.\n\nTL;DR\/Reasons\n\n* **Market cap = $1.66B = Same as GME and AMC in January 2021.**\n* **Down nearly 15% over the last 2 days despite earnings beat on all metrics simply due to current global supply chain issues.**\n* **Now trading 33% below fair value of $53.39 as per Nasdaq.com**\n* **Last time stock traded near current $36 support level was after last major dump on February 1. Stock recovered to $41 (10%+) by February 8 and hit $45 (20%+) by March 12.**\n* **As per June 15 earnings report, orders are currently backlogged at record levels for all products due to record demand.**\n* **Trailing 12 months P\/E ratio = 14.31 = Now cheaper than furniture industry average of 17.67 for this iconic brand!**\n\nLong version\/full DD\n\nAfter the 10 bagger+ successes of GME & AMC I think Reddit is ready for a new 10 bagger. I have looked long and hard for that opportunity and I think it is LZB. Why? This stock has everything Reddit needs!\n\n1. **LZB has extremely low market cap so it is easy to trade up the ticker -** LZB market cap is about the same as GME and AMC in January of this year before the mega pumps in price! Even without Reddit involvement this stock is pretty much guaranteed to go up from here as per [Entrepreneur.com](https:\/\/www.entrepreneur.com\/article\/374743) but if Redditors start buying this up this is EASILY the next ten bagger due to the low market cap.\n2. **It is trading well below fair value after being dumped over the past 2 days -** [Nasdaq.com](https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/an-intrinsic-calculation-for-la-z-boy-incorporated-nyse%3Alzb-suggests-its-21-undervalued) published an article yesterday saying the stock was trading 21% below value when it was trading at $42. Now it is at $36, the long-term support, which makes it 33% below fair value! Why did it dump? In their earnings call, they issued a warning about a temporary negative impact to profit margins in the short-term due to raw material price increases right now. However, they also said these issues will be offset by previously announced pricing actions as the company works through its immense backlog in the back half of the year. So basically, the dump is a super overreaction as their earnings report came out the same day J Powell did his press conference and caused the whole market to dump.\n3. **The stock will recover soon because it does this -** Because this stock has low market cap any news causes a dump that soon recovers. Simply looking at the chart over the past 6 months will show other such instances including the last major dump to this support level on February 1 and the subsequent recovery by 10%+ in only 8 days and a 20%+ recovery in just over a month after that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4. [**Forbes.com**](https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/warrenshoulberg\/2021\/06\/15\/la-z-boy-q4-proves-home-is-where-the-money-is\/) **notes that LZB is the poster child for the boom in home furnishings sales** \\- Some quotes for those that don't want to click through to the Forbes story -\n\n>If you want to know how real the boom in home furnishings sales is and how much America is spending to make their homes nicer, all you have to do is ask La-Z-Boy.  \nBy one measurement that the company uses, \u201cwritten same-store sales\u201d for the entire Galleries network doubled, increasing 100% for the quarter. For the year, those sales were up 31%.\n\nTheir CEO noted the following in the earnings call (also covered at Forbes) -\n\n>For the fiscal 2021 fourth quarter, record sales led to all-time record profits driven by increased production capacity, excellent performance by our company-owned La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries stores, and continued growth and profitability at Joybird.  \nFiscal 2022 is off to a great start with continued robust written order rates and a record backlog, setting us up well for a strong year of shipments ahead.\n\n5. **LZB beat on all important metrics including EPS and revenue as per their June 15 earnings report**\n\n6. **And yet this iconic king of furniture brands is currently cheaper than the furniture industry average thanks to this dump**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf Reddit gets interested in this low cap stock I expect it to go to the moon. I recommend getting in like I did. Best of luck and don't forget to buy one of these with your tendies\"\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nLastly, I want to add that the analysts covering LZB have all maintained and or raised their price targets into the 50s. The lowest price target is 46 which would still be a nice gain from where we are now.\n\nLZB has strong potential in the short and long term in my opinion. For a fantastic earnings beat, the drop in price was an overreaction, I think it will bounce.

There\u2019ve been a lot of phenomenal sentiment trackers around WSB, and wanted to give a results-first take on that approach \u2014 what I did was create one that focuses just one what people in this sub are saying. I\u2019ve created my own sentiment analyzer, and have been investing in it for more than a year now. If you want to take a crack at using it yourself, here\u2019s the\u00a0[source code](https:\/\/github.com\/tstewart161\/Reddit_Sentiment_Trader).\n\n# The Important Stuff\n\nLong story short for the week -- you'll $WISH you had $AMC in your portfolio last week, and...eh I got nothing. Anyways, when you compare this sentiment tracker to the benchmark social sentiment ETF, BUZZ, this one wins hands down. **This algorithm has returned 55% since March 2 (when BUZZ came out), compared to SPY's 10% and BUZZ's 7%.**\n\nI rebalanced my portfolio last week to include the 15 stocks below (equal-weighted), giving me a \\*\\*2.18% return week over week (net of any fees\/slippage), compared to a 0.39% loss for SPY and 0.66% loss for my benchmark, the VanEck BUZZ Social Sentiment ETF\\*\\*. **Important to note that not every week is a breakout win** (even if some member stocks in the ETF are), and not every week is a win at all. I've had some weeks where I've trailed both SPY and BUZZ by a lot, but overall I'm beating SPY YTD and BUZZ since its introduction.\u00a0\n\nYour typical sentiment analysis stuff coming through. I do this stuff for fun and make money off the stocks I pick doing it most weeks, so thought I'd share. I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. In addition to scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I also logged the popularity of the comment (giving it something similar to an exponential weight -- the more upvotes, the higher on the comment chain and the more people usually see it) and\/or post, and finally checked for the sentiment of each comment\/self text post.\n\n# How is sentiment calculated?\n\nThis uses VADER ( Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning), which is a model used for text sentiment analysis that is sensitive to both polarity (positive\/negative) and intensity (strength) of emotion. The way it works is by relying on a dictionary that maps lexical (aka word-based) features to emotion intensities -- these are known as sentiment scores. The overall sentiment score of a comment\/post is achieved by summing up the intensity of each word in the text. In some ways, it's easy: words like \u2018love\u2019, \u2018enjoy\u2019, \u2018happy\u2019, \u2018like\u2019 all convey a positive sentiment. Also VADER is smart enough to understand the basic context of these words, such as \u201cdidn\u2019t really like\u201d as a rather negative statement. It also understands the emphasis of capitalization and punctuation, such as \u201cI LOVED\u201d which is pretty cool. Phrases like \u201cThe turkey was great, but I wasn\u2019t a huge fan of the sides\u201d have sentiments in both polarities, which makes this kind of analysis tricky -- essentially with VADER you would analyze which part of the sentiment here is more intense. There\u2019s still room for more fine-tuning here, but make sure to not be doing too much. There\u2019s a similar phenomenon with trying to hard to fit existing data in stats called overfitting, and you don\u2019t want to be doing that.\n\nThe best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not - or develop a strategy investing in these stocks before they go parabolic. \\*\\*Although the results from this algorithm have beaten benchmarked sentiment indices like BUZZ and FOMO (on a risk-adjusted basis), sentiment analysis is by no means a \u201clong term SPY-beating strategy.\u201d\\*\\* I\u2019m well aware that most of my crazy returns are from GME and AMC (and more recently, WISH). These tickers do show up in BUZZ, but after they do on Reddit and at a lower weighting.\n\nSo, the data from last week:\n\n# WSB - Highest Sentiment Equities This Week (what\u2019s in the portfolio)\n\nEstimated Total Comments Parsed Last 7 Day(s): 300k-ish (the text file I store my data in ended up being 55mb -- it\u2019s nothing crazy but it\u2019s quite large for just text) \n\n&#x200B;\n\n|**Ticker**|**Comments\/Posts**|**Sentiment Score**|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|WISH|5,328|2,839|\n|CLNE|4,715|1,317|\n|GME|4,660|904|\n|BB|2,216|780|\n|CLOV|2,094|777|\n|AMC|2,080|646|\n|WKHS|936|295|\n|CLF|908|269|\n|UWMC|855|165|\n|ET|804|153|\n|TLRY|569|116|\n|CRSR|451|79|\n|SENS|282|75|\n|ME|82|36|\n|SI|59|35|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSentiment score is calculated by looking at stock mentions, upvotes per comment\/post with the mention, and sentiment of comments.\n\nHappy to answer any more questions about the process\/results.","149":"Fisker ($FSR) and Canoo ($GOEV), Their Discrepancy in Value, and Suspicious Canoo Price Action \\*This DD serves as mainly a bull case for Canoo and is not intended to be a bear case for Fisker.\n\n**Introduction:**\n\nFisker and Canoo are both EV companies that completed mergers with special purpose acquisition companies to go public and immediately gain access to capital. This was the route of choice for many other EV companies as well, since the automotive business is naturally capital intensive and this was the quickest avenue for them to get funding. I chose to compare Fisker with Canoo because they are both **legitimate** EV startups on similar timelines, and were compatible for comparable company analysis. \n\n**Current Valuations:**\n\nFisker has 295.24 million shares outstanding, and with a closing stock price of $19.30 is valued at **$5.7 billion**.\n\nCanoo has 237.5 million shares outstanding, and with a closing stock price of $9.67 is valued at **$2.3 billion**.\n\n**Models:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Canoo's Lifestyle Vehicle](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/bbz3ywca6u771.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d77153f52d1d954f8c3660306e92a21ada8999f)\n&#x200B;\n\n[Fisker's Ocean SUV](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/piv2ehs05u771.png?width=1260&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e23371f0deedde93db66e98cf08c94a364f2efb)\n\n\nThese are the two models Fisker and Canoo chose to begin production with. Clearly Fisker's Ocean SUV looks like something we are used to while Canoo's Lifestyle Vehicle is a modern\/reinvented minivan. The most used bear case against Canoo is the bold design of the minivan. However, what is overlooked is that the fully electric minvan market is **100% untapped** and Canoo is the only EV maker with plans to release one. Fisker's SUV is nice, but the electric SUV market is going to be one of the most competitive in the industry, with Tesla already having the Model X and Model Y, GM releasing it's electric Bolt SUV, and Ford releasing the Mach-E SUV. Canoo will have **no direct competitors** with their Lifestyle Vehicle. While it has a bold design, it's extra interior space will make it desirable regardless of it's look (who wouldn't want to take a Lyft\/Uber in that?).\n\nThe ocean starts at $37,499 while the lifestyle vehicle starts at $34,750. Canoo has 3 trims other than the base model: Delivery, Premium, and Adventure ([seen here](https:\/\/www.canoo.com\/canoo\/)) that will run more than that. Fisker likely will too but hasn't released any.\n\nCanoo already has released two other models (a Pickup truck and Delivery Vehicle) that they plan on producing in 2023. It's clear they are targeting the areas that have been untapped by EV's, practically guaranteeing themselves adequate demand.\n\nFisker has not released it's future models.\n\n**Production:**\n\nBoth companies plan to have production begin in Q4 of 2022, both doing so with the help of outside contract manufacturers. Fisker has a contract with [Magna](https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1720990\/000119312521192732\/d175606dex101.htm) for it's Ocean model and one with [Foxconn](https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/foxconn-to-build-cars-for-electric-vehicle-startup-fisker-11614169530) for a future unknown model. Canoo has a contract with [VDL Nedcar](https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1750153\/000155837021008512\/goev-20210616xex10d1.htm) for the production of it's first model, the Lifestyle vehicle, expecting to produce 1,000 units in 2022 and 15,000 in 2023. Fisker's long term plan is to stick with outsourcing it's production while Canoo has recently announced a contract to build it's own manufacturing facility in [Oklahoma](https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1750153\/000155837021008512\/goev-20210616xex99d2.htm).\n\nCanoo has been making vehicles for testing for months, and has over 500,000 test miles. [see here](https:\/\/twitter.com\/canoo\/status\/1405551289321263108)\n\n[Picture of Test Vehicle Taken in Buckeye, AZ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/7l32db087u771.png?width=3000&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1f7c929038678a3d7326266afcda07952d26443)\n\n**Financials:**\n\nCanoo had $642 million cash on hand on March 31st based on there last 10K.\n\nFisker had $985 million cash on hand on March 31st based on there last 10K.\n\nCanoo recently stated they have enough cash on hand to last them through their first production phase (Q4 of 2022). We can assume Fisker does as well, but they have not given a specific estimate.\n\n**Bearish Cases:**\n\nThe biggest bear cases for Canoo earlier this year was their pivoting away from the subscription model\/engineering services and the departure of their former CEO Ulrich Kranz. However, both go hand in hand and make perfect sense. In order to have their subscription model work, they would have to pay the cost of all the vehicles they planned on using upfront before generating any revenue. Their CAPEX is already going to be high enough and this plan made 0 sense. Helping other companies engineer their own electric vehicles also seemed counterintuitive. That would be like Burger King helping McDonalds create a new, healthier burger. These ideas were made by Ulrich Kranz, a famous engineer (clearly not a businessman). The board of directors realized this, and Ulrich decided to mutually part ways. It was not a hostile event and he still is holding over 1 million shares in the company.\n\nFisker's biggest bear case is probably it's CEO's, Henrik Fisker, previous failed attempt at starting an automotive business. His first company was also named Fisker and went upside down after a first product launch riddled with problems and a failed attempt to retool a factory(which is why he is probably sticking with the contract manufacturer route).\n\nBoth are often called pre-revenue duds\/bubble stocks. However, EV is the biggest business opportunity in the automotive industry since 1903 when the first Ford was made. With an estimated $2 trillion dollar automotive market up for grabs with gas prices soaring and green energy trending, I believe high EV valuations are warranted.\n\n**Back to Valuation:**\n\nAfter all this, why is Fisker currently worth 2.5 times more than Canoo? This type of discrepancy is not warranted.  You can argue it's hard to value pre-revenue companies(it is), but by that large of a margin? When they both have accomplished the same milestones and are on the same production timeline? I think it's more fishy than that. Canoo has had 2 months full of positive news and is still trading down, pinned under it's original NAV price of $10. Whenever it has broken it (2 times the past 3 weeks) it has quickly and sharply retreated back under 10.\n\n**Potential Explanation:**\n\nAfter March (when the news of the CEO departure and business model changed were released), GOEV shares were heavily shorted. Ever since then it seems the price has been actively manipulated.\n\nHere is a chart with the share price of GOEV (blue) and GME (orange) the past 6 months.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/0lwvqv6l9u771.png?width=1916&format=png&auto=webp&s=79be0b0a77caf2a00ad6c7659be5627b837cae85\n\nAs you can see, **before March** GME and GOEV movement were completely unrelated. But **after March**, they became very similar. Canoo could have gained hedge fund interest similar to that of GME. Otherwise it should easily be trading much closer to Fisker's valuation. Short interest has steadily risen and is now **almost 40%** (see my last [post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/o7pl8h\/goev_the_best_way_to_play_russel_reconstitution\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) for exact data).\n\n**Conclusion\/ TLDR**\n\nCanoo and Fisker are the most promising companies out of the EV startups. However, they are trading at valuations nowhere near each other. Canoo is severely undervalued in comparison to Fisker. Could be the result of short manipulation. Due to Russell 3000 Inclusion, volume should be up this week and things could get interesting.\n\n**Positions:**\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/mzb63hq0au771.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ce5a1861076e565ae7957e5c557b5be66a4552b\n\n**Disclosure:**\n\nThis is not financial advice.

Right now, it\u2019s at 60% buy and 40% hold. Analysts believe Wendy\u2019s is a BUY, with the most recent rating from Northland Securities rating it a buy with a price target of $30. Here\u2019s a link to some recent analyst ratings. [https:\/\/www.marketbeat.com\/instant-alerts\/nasdaq-wen-a-buy-or-sell-right-now-2021-06-2-3\/](https:\/\/www.marketbeat.com\/instant-alerts\/nasdaq-wen-a-buy-or-sell-right-now-2021-06-2-3\/)\n\nThird, the Rick and Morty advertising campaign - two internet favorites and the perfect mix of meme and undervalued stock. The Morty\u2019s pop-up restaurant drew in a lot of attention on social media, and the Rick and Morty-themed drinks \"Mello Yello BerryJerryboree\" and \"Mello Yello Portal Time Lemon Lime\" are available at more than 5,000 US Wendy's locations throughout the duration of the release of Rick and Morty season 5. As hype for Rick and Morty returns, Wendy\u2019s is set to profit from a large increase in demand for their BerryJerryboree and Portal Time Lemon Lime with the average restaurant profit margin of over 70% on soda sales.\n\n*Processing img ii8umcplw3771...*\n\nhttps:\/\/www.cnet.com\/news\/wendys-rick-and-morty-drinks-taste-like-candy-and-interdimensional-adventure\/\n\nFourth, Wendy\u2019s is opening stores in the UK. \u201c\\[Wendy\u2019s\\] plans to open hundreds of restaurants in the next several years, according to a company spokesman\u201d. As Wendy\u2019s becomes more available to our European brothers and COVID recovery progresses, we\u2019re sure to see huge increases in profits internationally.\n\n[https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/brits-queue-up-for-new-wendys-as-american-fast-food-invades-u-k-11623153601](https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/brits-queue-up-for-new-wendys-as-american-fast-food-invades-u-k-11623153601)\n\nFifth, Wendy\u2019s Breakfast. I\u2019m sure by now you\u2019ve heard that Wendy\u2019s has breakfast. It\u2019s pretty good, and since the inception of Wendy\u2019s breakfast last year it has accounted for 7% of their total sales, and is predicted to reach 10% by 2022.\n\n[https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2021\/03\/03\/business\/wendys-breakfast-sales\/index.html](https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2021\/03\/03\/business\/wendys-breakfast-sales\/index.html)\n\nAnd finally, Wendy\u2019s social media activity is still the biggest draw for meme potential for $WEN. According to an actual scientific study done on The Wendy's Twitter account, \u201cCreative humour and corporate communication norm violation promote the company's positive image and high user engagement.\u201d In other words, being funny and \u201cnot like other companies\u201d on social media is the most progressive advertising form that Wendy\u2019s has adopted, and it\u2019s worked extremely well, to the point of other companies following suit and copying the Wendy\u2019s example. Wendy\u2019s has had interactions with other big meme stocks on twitter as well, such as GameStop. If Wendy\u2019s Twitter would acknowledge WSB and their retail investors, it would be met with a lot of enthusiasm. If we could gain enough traction, I could see us getting some free frostys.\n\nThe scientific study is available to read here - [https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0378216620301120](https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0378216620301120)\n\nWendy\u2019s is undervalued, according to both analysts and WSBers. There is a lot of potential. Analyst price targets are around $30, and another WSB user compared McDonald\u2019s and Wendy\u2019s and came up with a valuation of $50+ per share, based on revenue and market cap data. [u\/amerikayo](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/u\/amerikayo\/) posted their comparison to McDonald\u2019s valuation that is worth reading here - [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/nvapjt\/wen\\_dd\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/nvapjt\/wen_dd\/)\n\nTLDR; WEN moon is inevitable.

Buy Macy's! Been lurking here and tired of seeing the same old GME, BB, CLOV, PLTR etc.  So how about an oldie but a goodie?\n\nYou\u2019re probably wondering why you should listen to some random guy on reddit who does not have diamond hands and doesn\u2019t post regularly on this forum. Well, you shouldn\u2019t. But you\u2019re lazy and do not want to do your own research. I am not in finance by trade, in fact, I am more of a real estate analyst than anything but I took an interest in equities and have an entire library worth of books from the classics such as Buffet\u2019s mentor Benjamin Graham, etc.. so of course you can take my word for it.\n\n**What Macy\u2019s is NOT.** **Why are the Shorts and Analysts\u2019 wrong?**\n\nI came to write **about Why the Shorts have it wrong on this one.** **As of May 28th, It\u2019s 17.8% short**!? Which I just do not understand. Besides the fact that they have a freaking awesome fireworks show on the Hudson river every year, they are basically an anchor tenant in every single mall. This is not JC Penny or Sears. **This company is holding 1.8 Billion in** **cash and not going anywhere**. Yes, malls have been on the beatdown because of the pandemic, but things are coming back and they\u2019re coming back fast.\n\nThis is not just a GME type company who is going to benefit solely from the shorts being squeezed and forced to buy back their positions at a higher price. This is a company that has been around for a long time with a solid business model and fundamentals.\n\nThe 1st quarter for 2021, Macy\u2019s beat out the earnings estimates from analysts by a huge margin yet a lot of them are still bearish on the company.  They reported their adjusted earnings of 39 cents per share which beat out Zack\u2019s Analyst Consensus of -41 cents. The analysts\u2019 had it wrong then and they still have it wrong now. Macy\u2019s has taken a beating this past month, which is a good thing if you want to buy the stock on the cheap.\n\n**Pent up Demand for Shopping**\n\nIf you\u2019re going to follow guys like Peter Lynch who talk about how you can beat wall-street just with your eyes. Go ahead and head down to your local Macy\u2019s and see it for yourself. You have the information with your eyes before Wallstreet can enter those numbers on a spreadsheet. Have you been to any malls lately? If you haven\u2019t, I\u2019ll tell you that they are absolutely packed.\n\nMacy\u2019s sales surged 56% year over-year last quarter yet sales are still down due to the pandemic so there is still room for upside. As offices re-open, people are going to start shopping again for their work clothes, etc. which is a key market for Macy\u2019s.\n\nUsually industry stocks move in lock-step with one another (a rising tide will lift all boats) and the retail sector is no exception. According to Zack\u2019s Industry Rank, the retail segment ranks 9 out of 250 industries meaning retail is going to be in pretty good shape. Analysts are starting to warm up a little bit over the past month by revising the earnings\u2019 estimate for the stock but of course you\u2019re going to want to get in earlier rather than later. They have revised the estimates from -19 cents to +13 cents per share for the quarter and from $0.76 cents to $2.15 per share for the year.\n\nThey have their Credit Card \/ Loyalty program, a major source of income for them, which added 1.7 million members. In addition to their retail operations with Macy\u2019s, Bloomingdale\u2019s, they are also investing heavily in their online segment which will be an additional area of growth\/sales for them as their 47% of their 4.6 million new customers came in digitally.\n\nEDIT: Also, the owner of the Carolina Panthers David Tepper bought in January.  I don't have Diamond Hands, but this dude sure does.\n\nSo all in all, not only am I supporting by buying stock, I\u2019m also going to rack up some money on my Macy\u2019s card.  What do you all think?\n\nDisclosures: Do not own Macy\u2019s stock but do plan to buy.","155":"An update from a crazy mostly-options trader This is an update to [my post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/b7qz14\/ok_wsb_heres_some_gain_and_loss_porn_for_you_all\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) from a couple of years ago in which I lost over $50k and then, at the time of posting, had almost made it all back.  What has happened since then?  All kinds of crazy shit.  (So it goes with options.)\n\nSimilarly to back then, I now have an impressive 1 month chart and not-so-impressive all-time chart, so I thought it was a fitting time to give an update.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[1 month chart](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/4wrwsgcnbh671.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e5efada36b1d7ce9648acad0590a85431efbe3d8)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[All-time chart](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/zmhx543rbh671.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8877a8cdc96cdac0e6203f5b52b57eeb18c33d6f)\n\nAfter I made my post, my account shot up to nearly +$90k.  I actually think it went over $90k, but Robinhood's all-time chart isn't very exact on the numbers.  (Side note: one thing I want to mention about these charts is that the percentages are not accurate according to my account value at the time because I have been depositing over the years... For example, when I was +$90k here, that was actually around a 200% gain at the time, not a 92% gain.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[My all-time high](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/hoqqy1ptbh671.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=36b8115cbe938a2d0fa2ec3b66aa7812dc296e76)\n\nHow did I get so many gains?  Well, this was a long time ago, and I make hundreds of trades per year, so I will just focus on some of the highlights in this post and hopefully that'll be good enough for the mods.  My biggest gains during this time were $AMZN calls prior to the 2020 crash and $INO calls and $SPY puts during the crash.\n\nHere's a screenshot I took of one of my $AMZN positions:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[AMZN gain 1\\\/31\\\/2020](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/q2aqy7ixbh671.jpg?width=1439&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b413b81186cca063745a7c9f6c21c6025addb1fb)\n\nHere's a $10k $INO gain:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[INO gain 3\\\/3\\\/2020](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/4iih5wwybh671.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7108da399df140c2677500a49fb5365c41ccff56)\n\nWell, I'm sure you saw that my gains didn't last, and I imagine you're thinking I lost them all during the 2020 crash.  Yes and no.  As I mentioned, I made a lot of money on SPY puts during the crash (I likely didn't screenshot these because it was a bunch of small, quick trades).  I actually only made money during the initial crash and completely dodged that bullet.  So what did happen?  Well, after the stock market rebounded significantly from the bottom, I bet heavily that it would go back down.  And well, as you know, it didn't.  So I lost all of my massive gains to $TSLA and $SPY puts after the rebound only kept going up.  I managed to find a screenshot of some of those losses:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Some SPY put losses 4\\\/8\\\/2020](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/q6xvm1hdch671.jpg?width=1426&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=db354d6bb5cea7b9dd4b081ee2abc9bf57d6da45)\n\nOnce I lost all of my gains, I just sold everything and took a break from risky trading.  You can see the chart is mostly sideways for 6 months before it plummets again.  This plummet I lost over $60k, even more than my old losses that I crawled back from.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[New all-time low](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/3d30zf4vdh671.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2da69f1e157782c71906ab00e39a701006ccf2c3)\n\nSo how did I get those massive losses again?  Well, in late 2020\/early 2021 I lost to $TSLA puts and $GME calls.  Both of these were good buys, I just sold them too soon.  My TSLA puts were bought when TSLA was over $800, but I got impatient and sold a few weeks before it would've made me money.  GME... Well, I don't want to talk about GME.  I sold just before it went crazy.  My position would have made me a millionaire.  I took a screenshot of my position before I sold because I had a feeling I would regret it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[GME position 12\\\/9\\\/2020](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/zknq2bklch671.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e6ac53d8bbc8970c5c322b4ae27d68ede8ea613d)\n\nI bought in on the GME squeeze thesis posted here in WSB, and I still believed in it at the time I sold.  But I had commented here that I was in on it, and I started to worry about the legality of it and decided it wasn't worth it.  What an idiotic decision.\n\nThe TSLA puts and GME calls weren't actually the majority of my losses, though.  That honor goes to my next position, $PFE calls.  This was actually another well-timed buy that went wrong because I sold too soon.   I bought PFE almost exactly at the bottom in late Feb stock-wise, but as the stock kept rising, my options kept deteriorating.  Eventually, I couldn't handle watching my options and account fall to near zero while the stock kept rising, and I gave up and sold.  Had I held on another week, I would have made all of my money back.  Another 2 weeks, and I would have had big gains.  I didn't screenshot this disaster and would have to dig through my history for details, but I feel like no one would care to have these details.  Suffice to say it was about 1,000 call options the decayed despite upward stock movement.\n\nAnd thankfully, I made back all of my losses anyway, as you can see from my all-time chart.  After all of my disasters, I decided I was done with short-term trading and was just going to invest via LEAPs in some high growth companies.  So I did some DD and bought LEAPs on companies I thought were undervalued, most notably $SPCE, $XPEV, and $WISH.  I bought these planning to hold long term and didn't expect these would rocket higher immediately after I bought them.\n\nI didn't screenshot full positions, but here are some of the trades in my history if you feel you need proof for the recent gains.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[SPCE buys](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/fr4u3i62dh671.png?width=716&format=png&auto=webp&s=9019221417f56ce97cb827ae25540d2c18820cd8)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[SPCE sells](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/7fb30dt3dh671.png?width=712&format=png&auto=webp&s=8bd46e160981d9bea69e7be2199acc6fda5f5ba3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[XPEV buys](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/6vhafze8dh671.png?width=714&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc543ee9d002978c3ba8e75bff0c7ff682fbf5e1)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[XPEV sells](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/pco0yzy9dh671.png?width=727&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb209ac22850b9a5f3fab10029ca2eea2347a5a3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[WISH gains](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/doe68wjgdh671.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=826e8870c8389a81aa95ee2dab83ce5df38e864c)\n\n(I made more money than is shown in these screenshots; again, they're not the full positions.)\n\nI also liked someone's DD here of $CLOV, and decided to take a small position in CLOV as well.  This screenshot is just before selling, so luckily I held onto these gains:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[$4.5k into $31k.

So where am I now?\n\nActually, I'm back heavily in $WISH.  Here's my current WISH position:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[WISH current position](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/g0hywmp2eh671.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4a08b1cf153dae3812d85292e5e7b06e9045a4f4)\n\n(These screenshots are from Thursday but they're close to the same value now).  I could go into detail telling you why I like WISH so much right now, but there are plenty of DD posts to be found.  What it boils down to is that this thing is still at less than half of its IPO value, and I think it's severely oversold for a growing e-commerce site, regardless of what some people might think of the products.  You think the quality of products is too cheap to be successful, I'll just kindly point you in the direction of $DG and its chart.  Note I bought a lot of WISH shares here even though I don't usually buy shares.  The premium on WISH options is a bit high, and I'm trying to chill out a bit after my massive unexpected gains this last month.\n\nI also have smaller positions in $ACAD, $AYX, $QS, and $RUN.  I like a lot of other stocks right now, but I just have my money tied up currently.  For example, I want to start new positions in $PLTR, $OPEN, $SNOW, $F, $AEVA, and $VIEW when I get a chance.  I also want to get back in $SPCE and $XPEV if I get a dip, as well as hoping for a dip in some others like $DIS and $DDD, and a ton of other companies whose stocks are just too expensive for me at the current moment.  I also don't think you'd be wrong to be into metals, especially nickel.  Hopefully I haven't mentioned any banned tickers here.  There are a lot of multibagger opportunities out there right now, imo, assuming hyperinflation and rising interest rates + QT don't cause a massive bear market, of course.\n\nAlthough I feel like I'm decent at this, I also felt like I was decent at it before I lost $150k in 2020 and 2021 from high to low.  To be fair to myself, the measures the government and Fed took to prop up the market\/economy were unprecedented when I bought those SPY puts, and most of the recent losses on TSLA and PFE were good buys but bad sells (i.e, sold too early).  But that doesn't change that I ultimately made a bad trade.  Anyway, you can ask me for options or trading advice and I'll try to answer, but honestly right now I'm still not feeling the most qualified.\n\nOne last thing, a lot of people down $50k (which was like 90% of my account at the time) or my recent $65k losses would have thrown in the towel on options completely.  I'm proof you can turn it around... I've done it twice now.  That said, I'm also proof that you can lose it all quickly in the options world.  I wouldn't advise most people to do this.  I have separate retirement funds, college funds for my children, and make a decent living with a relatively secure job.  I would be okay if I lost it all.  This is just me trying to win a ticket to early retirement.  But don't do it if you can't afford to lose it.","156":"Daily option statistics for CLNE, AMC, BB, WISH, GME, CLOB, WKHS, PLTR, NVDA, and others.

Some of you dipped into $CLF last week but we're going further. We Marvel multiverse now (ps Loki sucked ass).\n\n**United States Steel Corporation a.k.a. $X steel**, is the oldest steel producing company in the U.S., and 2nd largest behind Nucor Corporation ($NUE). It was founded by J.P. Morgan, Charles Schwab and other rich ass wall street boomers in early 1900s. With an unstable market ahead due to inflation and fear projections, here are reasons why this boomer company older than Buffett himself is your fix of Pepto Bismol and Xanny combined, as Hot-Rolled Coil steel prices continue its All Time High run into the summer:\n\n**\\*\\*Short Interest\\*\\***\n\nFind it yourself, I don't care about it.

What history you ask? US Steel stock peaked exactly 13 years ago in June 2008, along with many other steel stocks, then proceeded to fall off a cliff due to the 2008 financial crisis stemming from overleveraged greedy ass wall street banks getting defaults on their mortgage gambles. This was amplified by the fact that steel production was at 90% capacity for these companies all jumping in to take advantage of the bubble that had formed, raising HRC prices to then-All-Time-High of \\~$1000. Needless to say, steel tanked after and they learned their lesson. You can bet your ass they won't let that happen again to remain ridiculously profitable post-inflation.\n\n[June 2 HRC futures](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/r1n6lg7aot571.png?width=1119&format=png&auto=webp&s=0255d98e0605d606a8c0351807171207c462a523)\n\n[June 16 HRC futures](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/chssf8zaot571.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=540de73dc1d96c289718f1bdf51f815d3abb59e4)\n\nAbove are the HRC prices of June 2nd, followed by yesterday June 16.

It ain't exactly the same scenarios, but I'm bullish and there's room to run on the stock.\n\nSteel stocks have run \\~100-200% depending since Covid\/March 2020.

He knows.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Technicals** \\- Here's some charting back 9 months on $X and $CLF (orange line) compared - **From the technicals, my findings are as follows:**\n\n[X and CLF compared charts, 9 months](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/am3d7uhgot571.png?width=1360&format=png&auto=webp&s=8405aef585e9cbd68f46980d0f24a7904c069a05)\n\n* CLF shares historically trade below X by \\~$2-$4. This changed in February 2021, circled in chart as #1, due to X offering 42 million shares to the public, increasing the float up to \\~250m shares. I thought this would be the turning point for CLF but investors gobbled it up and the dip was short-lived.\n* This told me X is gonna X no matter what, it's the United Steel States Corporation founded by J.P Morgan himself among others. Even with ZERO recent hype while $CLF has WSB eyes for a week, you can see that X moved parallel (as steel should) to CLF, and maintains the lead. That will continue. CLF goes up, X will rise harder. More upside.\n* **2** indicates the run-up pre\/post earnings. Most steel companies report earnings at a similar time. CLF will be the next one in mid-July. Imagine steel companies continue trading sideways while their predominant steel product in HRCs rise to new ATH's in a recovery summer with infrastructure plans on the horizon and severe supply shortages. Can't? Me neither. Pleas fly again.\n* **3** leading up to 4 in yellow circles are the market pullbacks in May, triggered by worse-than-expected CPI report. Remember last month? PLTR bled all the way down to $16, digital currency took a massive 50% hit from ATH, and Cathie Wood was no longer giving you wet dreams. But X steel? 24% dip down to $23.40 level, bought up immediately again within the week. Now, chilling on the resistance.\n* **4** is resistance. Even on bloody days, X refuses to dip below \\~$25.75 and $25.40. It's there right now as I type. Apart from that bloodbath in May, X does not dip below that channel in the two-month chart. Yesterday, it hit this mark again - market bled and X hit this resistance for the 10th time in 2 months. And I am about $35k USD certain that it's ready to bounce to a new high. Inflation is real, so where does money go? Hold cash and lose money? Lol, no. \"Guarantees\". Bonds\/Trusts. Cyclicals. Companies that make money. X is going to make some damn money this year. Where does JP Morgan want to put their $500 billion?([https:\/\/markets.businessinsider.com\/news\/stocks\/jpmorgan-jamie-dimon-stockpiled-500-bln-cash-prepare-higher-inflation-2021-6-1030522253](https:\/\/markets.businessinsider.com\/news\/stocks\/jpmorgan-jamie-dimon-stockpiled-500-bln-cash-prepare-higher-inflation-2021-6-1030522253)) \"Steel is a generational opportunity\" their words.\n* X had lower earnings during the pandemic compared to CLF, but reported higher earnings (Adjusted EBITDA \/ EPS) in Q1 2021. As X has higher margins, assets and debt overall, US steel has a lot more room for recovery\/growth than other steel stocks, which it is primed to obtain AND beyond at this rate. The Return of the King is in the works.\n* X has dividends. It's small, but a company to post one of their most profitable years in history with raised guidance after a shares offering will likely return something to shareholders. RKT special $1 dividend? Torchlight Energy special preferred A dividend share? Not sure. Expecting something on this front towards their earnings next month however.\n* Price targets by analysts don't matter and often, I'm more tempted to sell than buy depending on the coverage. But JP Morgan along with other banks are hoarding literal billions in cash due to QE, inflation and low rates, and they won't sit on it for long, they're going to buy in, if not already. They are smart money after all. Here are the price targets for $X.\n\n\\-Credit Suisse - $35 May 4\n\n\\-Morgan Stanley - $32 May 17\n\n\\-UBS Group - $30 June 4\n\n\\-JP Morgan - $41 June 16 (yesterday)\n\n\\-Goldman Sachs - $25 April 9 - this is outdated and will update by end of this month probably. No way we see below $30 in July IMHO.\n\n* Thus, upside potential is higher for X. Among American steel stocks like $CMC, $NUE, $SCHN, $STLD, $CLF, and $X, US steel ran the least Year-to-Date (+50.51%). X steel also had the highest of highs among Steel stocks in '08.\n\n[Steel Armageddon '08](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/hlvyxzxoot571.png?width=760&format=png&auto=webp&s=3fbc5f50b75d14f677e2a0c8c10a4d67654a4d65)\n\n**But honestly, fundamentals mean shit and this is a casino. So here are two main reasons why I like $X.**\n\n**1. Market Capitalization:** X's market cap is one of lowest among steelmakers. Their float at \\~260m shares is half of \\~500m in $CLF and other stocks like $WISH, $AMC, $BB, so on. Market cap is the biggest reason why we likely will never see something like $GME again. Before last week, CLF's daily volume of \\~18m(4% float) was lower than X's volume of \\~21m(9% float), despite having double the available shares. X moves more swiftly and momentously than you can expect of this boomer. I imagine X's volume to \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 heading into July without a doubt. They are THE United States Steel after all, soon to post historical earnings in a commodity boom.\n\n**\\*\\*2. The United States Steel Corporation. US Steel. Ticker -X-.\\*\\*** Fucking X.

So here goes. This past year has been insanity, and I think it has caused quite a bit of disillusionment and will also be detrimental to many bank accounts as we move increasingly closer to higher inflation and a rising rate environment. Hear me out.\n\nSo, some context, following my trading style, I was all over GME in late August when Cohen released his 13D; GME was already on my radar because of Burry, who's investing\/trading style I try to mimic. DFV\/Roaring Kitty, Rod, and others were also a big inspiration in spreading good, solid DD. It was a true deep value play. When GME released its Q2 2020 results on September 8th, it was terrifying, because we dropped almost back below $6; however, one thing shined through, and that was the almost $1 billion in free cash flow (fcf). The big push after that ER drop of course was the Microsoft partnership. That showed exactly how committed the console vendors were to keeping GME in business - making a console is actually not profitable, its the sales after the console, and GME is a huge part in reducing Customer Acquisition Costs for console vendors. Of course the SI was always the big thing - 140%, but it wasn't what made many of us have \"diamond hands\", it was the business, and its crucial role in the gaming industry - hell, what made Burry go deep in GME? When he got confirmation that the new console cycle would include disc drives. Anyways, my whole point is this - what made GME, GME, was its deep value, that it was, in the infamous words of Burry - \"A long term franchise trading at a significant discount from growing intrinsic value.\" Which, always, is the preference when you are looking for the best possible trade to execute.\n\nSo what does this have to do with ViacomCBS - VIAC? Well, it is precisely that, it is a long term franchise trading at a significant discount from growing intrinsic value. How so? Ok, first, the basic test is this: what is its margin of safety based on discounted cash flow analysis (dcf); what is its enterprise value divided by earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization (ev\/ebitda); and what is its price\/free cash flow. This basic first pass test shows VIAC has: 49% margin of safety, 8.0 ev\/ebitda, and 7.8 price to free cash flow. These are all really, really good for what is a long term franchise; and they have over $3 billion in fcf, a big fat number. Yes, debt is $19 billion, but they have total assets of $54 billion. Oh yeah, p\/e is 9.8, which is not, in my opinion, the best metric for value, but its pretty damn good.\n\nOk, so they pass the basic deep value screener. But the real clincher is this. They aren't just \"value\" but are also showing GROWTH. Burry pounds this home, and he learned it from Graham & Dodd and Buffet. You don't look for just \"value\" or \"growth\", you find BOTH. So how is VIAC doing this? Well, look at how aggressive management is with their streaming strategy, which they are being extremely aggressive. First, we know they released Paramount+ in March, rebranding CBS All Access. Was it good, no. It was shit. However, they made it clear they are, and did, improve it. They recently dropped 1,000 movies, will drop a new movie every week starting in 2022, and, importantly, they will CEASE to license their content to third party streamers. No more movies\/shows going to Netflix\/Amazon. Besides CBS and Paramount Studios, VIAC owns Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, BET, MTV, CMT, VH1, and several other networks that have hugely popular series. When they get all of that content exclusive to Paramount+, woah. For instance, look at Disney+, it took them about a year to get all the Marvel and Star Wars movies all centralized on Disney+, and when they did, subs went through the roof. Better believe ViacomCBS will get ALL their HUGE number of big movies and shows streaming exclusively to Paramount+. This is a big deal. Of course VIAC owns Showtime (doesn't hurt to mention they had the huge Mayweather PPV event this quarter) and between Paramount+, Showtime and BET+, they have 36 million monthly active users (MAUs). I think we will also see a bundle of Paramount+ and Showtime, and they just released an extremely cheap and competitive limited ad service for Paramount+ for $4.99. They are also being extremely aggressive with international markets - you know, the other billions and billions outside the United States.\n\nThen there is Pluto TV, their AVOD (ad video on demand, Paramount+ is an SVOD, subscription on demand) free TV streaming service, literally free, and excellent, check it out if you haven't. They paid $300 million for it back in 2019; it now has over 55 million global monthly active users (MAUs) and rising. AVODs are the future, and it is projected Pluto will bring in ONE BILLION in ad rev by 2022. That is huge. Also, over the top (OTT) advertising is the future, and ViacomCBS owns the best OTT technology. OTT is basically this, based on your browsing history, connected devices, they will target you with ads that might be of interest to you, not simply the ads that everyone sees. This is the way all advertising will go, and VIAC is leading the way with one of the biggest free AVOD services, Pluto TV. Finally, Pluto TV is a \"super funnel\" to Paramount+. Everyone in the streaming business will tell you, the gold standard is to have a strong AVOD and SVOD, and that is what VIAC has.\n\nThen of course there is Paramount Studios. They just had the highest grossing movie of the pandemic, A Quiet Place II. But even more important, the studio is fully reopened and in full production. Huge. Then of course CBS. Sure, older viewing audience, but don't balk at that. They have 6 of the top 10 shows in primetime TV. That is HUGE ad revenue. Also this quarter they had March Madness Finals, Masters, and the PGA Tour Finals that Mickelson won. Then they have the NFL, Champions League, and so much more in terms of sports, as well as the number one news network. All that can be streamed live on Paramount+. That is just more growth, more revenue, and advantages other streaming services don't have.\n\nThe real important point is this however: VIAC is the second largest content creator in the world, second only behind Disney. That is right, the second largest producer of shows, movies, and sports. In fact, that is all they do. They aren't a cable or phone company, they don't run an amusement park. They just make content, and content is KING in the streaming business, which is where we are all moving towards. They are the only major content producer that is vertically integrated that is left standing - i am not going to talk about merger and acquisition rumors, but Shari Redstone is more amenable to selling than we all think - and it makes VIAC incredibly valuable, incredibly valuable: VERTICALLY INTEGRATED. That means they don't just produce content, but they can distribute it via their own networks. MGM, bought by Amazon recently, was not vertically integrated. Now, when you look at their market cap, $26 billion, relative to all the content they own and their networks to distribute that content, they are INSANELY undervalued. Bottom line, this is a rare event, like GME was.\n\nIf you're getting concerned about what is happening in this market, what has happened over the last year, and get a feeling the \"party\" is about to end. Look even more into VIAC. I'm not going to pander and say I am a retarded autistic ape who eats crayons. However I do eat a shitload of chicken tenders.","161":"Former hedge fund trader breaks down why TWNK is an insanely good value play AND speculative meme stock to ride  \ud83d\udcf7\ud83d\udcf7\n\n**TL;DR** \\- *$TWNK has great value, can be a great long-term play with steady income through buying stock only or buy-write call option strategy,* ***\\*AND\\**** *it's an insanely good short term speculative play because it has higher\/similar short interest % than GME or AMC and trades on way less volume with an insane \\~20 days for shorts to cover so it has \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 potential!*\n\n\"Guess it's impossible to post on WSB? If anyone knows how help me out. I'm not new to Reddit but I'm old (40s) and haven't used it in years so I lost my username lol.\"  -Posted for user: u\/TeddyPayne12\n\nI'm a former hedge fund trader who left the business years ago to pursue a more meaningful career, aka I've been poor ever since \ud83d\ude02 No but for real \ud83d\ude2d Started trading seriously again last year when the market crashed and did fairly well. Loving this Ape era, missed GME but still holding some AMC calls!\n\nI'm super bullish on $TWNK for 2 reasons (with a bunch of sub-reasons): because I believe in its **value** (analysis below) and it's a double play trade for **speculation**.\n\n**1. VALUE**\n\nthere's very little downside risk in the stock, which makes it a perfect pure equity play (buy the stock)-OR-you can buy-write it all day long (buy stock and sell equivalent number of calls, so you collect the premium and make a great return PLUS you put a stop-loss order on your downside so you can't lose a penny).\n\n*EXAMPLE OF BUY-WRITE*: TWNK closed at $16.50 last night. The July $17.50 calls were $1. If you buy 100 shares of the stock for $16.50 and sell 1 option contract at $1, you've spent $1,550 total (100 x $16.50 for stock) minus (1 x 100 x $1 for calls) = $1,550.\n\n1. If the stock goes to $17.50 or above -- the contract will be exercised, so you'll have no position left but you'll have just made another $100, making $200 on your $1,550 which is 13% in a month(!)\n2. If the stock hovers in between $16.50 and $17.50 -- you sell at whatever price it ends at, add that to your $100 from selling the calls and that's your profit -OR- you sell the next month's calls and collect more profit while the stock hovers\n3. If the stock goes down then you just set a stop-loss limit order at whatever price you don't want to go below and you'll lock in profits\/minimize losses (since you're protected on price down to $15.50 from selling the calls)\n\nRegarding TWNK value, there have been some posts in the past 1 week to 4 months that did a pretty good job so I won't repeat them here but take a look then I'll tell you what I think.\n\n1)[https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/nxinqq\/hostess\\_twnk\\_is\\_a\\_sleeping\\_giant\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/nxinqq\/hostess_twnk_is_a_sleeping_giant\/)\n\n2)[https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/nw3a0r\/why\\_im\\_balls\\_deep\\_in\\_twnk\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/nw3a0r\/why_im_balls_deep_in_twnk\/)\n\n3)[https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/nz073d\/hostess\\_brands\\_twnk\\_followup\\_to\\_my\\_long\\_thesis\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/nz073d\/hostess_brands_twnk_followup_to_my_long_thesis\/)\n\n4)[https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/nvhe4k\/hostess\\_is\\_it\\_time\\_to\\_go\\_balls\\_deep\\_in\\_twnk\\_for\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/nvhe4k\/hostess_is_it_time_to_go_balls_deep_in_twnk_for\/)\n\nHere's what I'll add:\n\n1. **Possible news TODAY**: investor meeting at Evercore ISI Consumer and Retail Summit ([webcast here](https:\/\/www.hostessbrands.com\/events\/event-details\/evercore-isi-consumer-retail-summit))\n2. It consistently beats market expectations\n3. Upcoming summer season with more drivers on the road and sky high post-pandemic travel expected will boost sales, which are driven by convenience stores and through which they have a \"differentiated distribution model that gives Hostess unique access\" per Morningside analyst report\n4. It has consistently beaten market expectations and added value for investors ever since it re-emerged as a \\*brand new company\\* after bankruptcy -- not a reorg of the old one. Per one analyst report: \"After the 2012 bankruptcy, investors purchased only the brand rights and recipes from the bankruptcy court, freeing them of employee benefits and other labor obligations that had weighed down the company in the past.\"\n\n**SPECULATION**\n\nAbove are my reasons for *investing* in $TWNK, but below are my reasons I am *trading* it right now.\n\nIf people decided this was the new meme stock, it would be a wild ride -- it's 17% shorted per the latest report (5\/28) and trades on very little volume -- around a million shares a day normally with 131 million shares outstanding. By comparison, AMC traded about 5 \\*million\\* shares a day before all this craziness happened, with 450 million shares outstanding and 22% short interest. GME traded about 3 million shares a day on 72 million shares outstanding and 20% short interest.\n\nBecause of the volume -- it's short ratio is super high -- 20.15 as of today, which means it would take shorts 20 days to cover. That makes it about as ripe for a short squeeze as a stock can get.\n\n**BOTTOM LINE**\n\nCan't really find a reason why not to buy the stock, or at least buy-write it and protect yourself on the downside. If people pile into it -- we could be talking about serious money if the stock pops.\n\nDisclosure\n\nI am long TWNK stock and I have a covered call position worth about 5% of my portfolio, which is nothing big (\\~$80k lol)\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThis is not financial advice and I am not a financial advisor.","162":"DD on BBBY: grotesquely over-shorted stonk with great fundamentals compared to competitors I'm not going to talk about BBBY's new management that's turning the company around (just like in GME!), or that 32% of its float has been shorted (that's pretty ridiculous all by itself) - I'll just post some fundamentals for y'all to look at and make your own conclusions:\n\n1. P\/E ratio of 18.47 vs industry average P\/E of 19.57.\n\n2. P\/B ratio of 2.66 vs industry average of 5.83.\n\n3. P\/S ratio of 0.35 vs industry average of 0.89.\n\n4. P\/CF ratio of 11.79 vs industry average of 23.19.\n\nQuarterly earnings will come out in less than a month, on July 14th. BBBY has been under intense short-seller attack after briefly spiking at $44.51 on 6\/02. Just last week, it got driven down by 9% on Wednesday and another 9% on Thursday. All of that was on zero news: just plain and simple short-seller feeding frenzy...\n\nI'm not posting this to hype anything up or to distract anyone from AMC\/BB\/GME (there's plenty of over-shorted stonks with good fundamentals for all of us) - I'm merely writing down my own research as I learn more about BBBY. With every dip, I either average down or buy more calls. When - not if, but when - this spikes up again, it'll be fucking glorious. :)\n\nThe earnings will come out on July 14th. A lot of Wall Street types seem to like BBBY's fundamentals and its transformation, which is why I expect a reversal of the downward trend as we get closer to that date.

For those of you who missed out on the sweet tendies from WWE last week here\u2019s your chance to redeem yourself. Vizio is no GME or AMC, but as long as I\u2019m getting 1000% gains mainlined to my mommy\u2019s basement I don\u2019t give a fuck. \n\n# I: Fundamentals\n\nI know 97% of you retards don\u2019t about fundamentals let alone even know how to spell fundamental, but for the 3% that can tie your own shoes here\u2019s some highlights from their Q1 [results](https:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20210511006163\/en\/VIZIO-HOLDING-CORP.-Reports-Q1-2021-Financial-Results): \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Net revenue increased 52% year over year to $505.7 million for Q1\n* Platform+ net revenue increased 120% year over year to $52.2 million\n* Gross profit increased 82% year over year to $86.7 million\n* Adjusted EBITDA increased 218% year over year to $40.4 million\n* SmartCast Active Accounta grew 57% year over year to 13.4 million\n* SmartCast Hours grew 70% year over year to 3.6 billion\n* Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) increased 76% year over year to $14.52\n\nAnd here\u2019s the part that gets me the most excited, Gross Profit from Platform is up 152% year over year. Vizio is already ranked #2 in best selling TV brand and #1 in best selling soundbars, and now they\u2019re going to start competing in the smart TV market. The king of the smart TV Market right now is Roku, controlling a [30% market share as of Q1 2021](https:\/\/9to5google.com\/2021\/05\/03\/roku-global-streaming-marketshare-drops\/#:~:text=Conviva%20reports%20(via%20Protocol)%20that,to%2030%25%20in%20Q1%202021.). The King is hurt right now, reeling from their awkward breakup with [Youtube TV](https:\/\/clark.com\/streaming-tv\/roku-announces-youtube-tv-breakup\/). Turns out Youtube TV actually prefers Vizio\u2019s [magnum dong](https:\/\/www.engadget.com\/vizio-smart-cast-owners-no-longer-need-two-apps-for-you-tube-132131066.html#:~:text=Just%20here%20to%20drop%20a,in%20the%20next%20few%20days.). I\u2019m willing to bet Vizio becomes a major player in the streaming market, plus they have the advantage of already being a huge TV manufacturer. Roku certainly got a head start, but we\u2019ve seen companies blow a 3-1 lead before \\*cough\\* Skype. We all know streaming is the future, and the future of Vizio\u2019s Smartcast (and by extension our tendies) right now is bright. And I\u2019m not the only one who thinks this, As of 6\/11\/2021 Vizio has 7 Buy ratings and a consensus price target of $30.29. For the mathematically challenged that\u2019s a *33.6%* upside from where the stock is now. Or put simply to any boomers skulking around, that\u2019s 3.36 years of returns compared to your boomer index S&P fund, and I\u2019m being fucking generous. \n\n# II. Catalysts\n\nVizio is getting into the data tracking\/advertisement business as well, recently reporting that they have just surpassed [11 million addressable enabled TVs](https:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20210609005230\/en\/VIZIO-Surpasses-11-Million-Addressable-Enabled-TVs) in the US. Why does this matter? It's yet another income stream for the TV manufacturing god, and one that has been insanely profitable for other companies. For those of you who live under a rock, almost all of these tech companies are competing for your data to sell to advertisers, and Vizio is finally getting into the game. We're only a few years away from lightspeed briefs ads being beamed into your dreams while you sleep, so for Vizio to start carving out a market share in this space I think is pretty significant. \n\n# III: Technicals\n\nHere\u2019s why I think VZIO can be a WWE junior.\n\n**Extremely low float:** The float on this is around 18 million shares, which is less than half of the float on WWE. And for you AMC and GME retards, Vizio\u2019s float is only 4% of AMC\u2019s and less than half of GME\u2019s. If you\u2019re still confused let me say it this way. If everyone subscribed to wallstreetbets wanted 2 shares there wouldn\u2019t be enough shares to go around. I\u2019ve been sniffing around and this is the lowest float non-bullshit stocks I\u2019ve been able to find. And by non-bullshit I mean Vizio actually has a respectable market cap and actually makes money. \n\n**Volume is low:** Volume is extremely low and trending lower. Average volume is only around 400k and has been trending downward ever since the IPO. \n\n**Options are cheap:** IV on this stock is only 54%. For reference, when CLNE popped the IV was around 80%. If there is any kind of volume spike this IV will go up considerably. It is crazy to me that the IV can be this low when the consensus price target has a 33% upside. \n\n**Moderate SI:** The SI is only moderate sitting at 7%, but still enough to cause some heartburn. And fuck it, it\u2019s you know what season. With the IV so low if the shorts were forced to cover we could see some serious tendies. \n\n**Huge Omega:** With the IV so low it won\u2019t take much movement for our options to print. The [Omega](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/o\/omega.asp), or elasticity is huge. For example, when Vizio went up 3.60% last Friday June 18 2021 Calls increased 84%, or an Omega of 23.4. Plus not only is the Omega large, the options chains are fucking *scarce.* July FDs only go up to $30 strike, and if you were paying attention to the Fundamentals section that\u2019s below their target price. \n\n# IV: Conclusion\n\nThis is my pick for a low-risk high reward play.  Its got everything I looked for plus the options are cheap. On the 3.6% move last Friday even my Nov 19 $25 calls went up 12%. It was fun riding the WWE tending train last week, and I think we could have a similar situation here. \n\nYou could even play this stock like a boomer (buy and hold, can\u2019t go tits up) and come out with some solid gains if we hit the consensus price target. I think the July 25C have a great chance of printing. I\u2019m personally holding shares, June 18 22.5 C, July 16 25 C, and Nov 19 25 C, and if this post gains traction here I'll probably add some 25C FDs. \n\nNot financial advice, buy some shares and options or don\u2019t, I don\u2019t really give a fuck. I just like the stock and the 32\" Vizio my mommy got me for birthday so I thought I'd share this post with you degenerates.

The short seller has recently waged other critiques against Lordstown Motors Corp. and Nikola Corp., which contributed to heavy losses on the stocks.\n\n\u201cThis report is written by someone who is short on DraftKings stock with an incentive to drive down the share price,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nDraftKings shares have slipped from a March record\nThe Hindenburg report on DraftKings focused on the company\u2019s technology platform subsidiary SBTech, as well as profits made by insiders who have cashed in on the stock\u2019s surge from its deal announcement. DraftKings had soared nearly 400% from December 2019 when the company announced its three-way deal to go public alongside SBTech through Monday\u2019s close.\n\nDraftKings said it conducted a thorough review of SBTech\u2019s business practices and that it was \u201ccomfortable with the findings\u201d before the deal was completed in 2020.\n\nCredit Suisse analyst Benjamin Chaiken defended DraftKings in a note, saying investors should use the stock\u2019s drop as an opportunity ahead of potential gambling legalization in Canada and in New York. The analyst rates the stock \u2018outperform\u2019, with a price target at $85.\n\nBroad Declines\nWeakness for sports betting companies went beyond DraftKings as the Roundhill Sports Betting & iGaming exchange-traded fund (BETZ), a sports betting and iGaming ETF, dipped as much as 2.5%. Flutter Entertainment Plc., which owns DraftKings\u2019 rival FanDuel, fell as much as 5.5% in London.\n\n\nDraftKings shares have stumbled over recent months amid a dearth of top sporting events and a broader slide for high-flying companies. The company is one of a slew of startups that have gone public through mergers with special purpose acquisition companies.\n\nThe gaming company has yet to turn a profit and is not expected to post positive earnings until 2026, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\nHowever, Wall Street analysts are broadly positive on the company with 20 rating shares a buy and eight having hold-equivalents. None rate it a sell and the average 12-month price target of $70 implies shares will rise 49% over the coming year.\n\nShort Risks\nShort sellers are increasingly facing pushback on trading platforms and social media, where retail traders publicly challenge investors who stand to profit from a company\u2019s woes.\n\nTrading in so-called meme stocks has remained hot since the start of the year after Reddit users rallied behind video game retailer GameStop Corp. after investors including Citron Capital\u2019s Andrew Left and Gabriel Plotkin\u2019s Melvin Capital announced bets against the company.\n\nLeft said the money manager covered most of its short bets against GameStop at a loss of 100% in late January and later said his firm would discontinue offering short-sell analysis.\n\nRoughly one-tenth of DraftKings shares available for trading are currently sold short, according to data compiled by S3 Partners. That compares to a February low of 5.2%.\n IM LONG THE STONK WE TOOK EM OUT ONCE \n ...let's do it again to the moon\ud83c\udfa9\ud83e\udd8d\ud83d\udc4f\nSource: https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2021-06-15\/draftkings-tumbles-after-attack-from-short-that-hammered-nikola","165":"$VZIO - Tendies in 4K   \n\nTLDR;\n\nExtremely low float \\~ 18 mil\n\nSolid Fundamentals, great company outlook if anyone even cares anymore.

For those of you who missed out on the sweet tendies from WWE last week here\u2019s your chance to redeem yourself. Vizio is no GME or AMC, but as long as I\u2019m getting 1000% gains mainlined to my mommy\u2019s basement I don\u2019t give a fuck. \n\n# I: Fundamentals\n\nI know 97% of you retards don\u2019t about fundamentals let alone even know how to spell fundamental, but for the 3% that can tie your own shoes here\u2019s some highlights from their Q1 [results](https:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20210511006163\/en\/VIZIO-HOLDING-CORP.-Reports-Q1-2021-Financial-Results): \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Net revenue increased 52% year over year to $505.7 million for Q1\n* Platform+ net revenue increased 120% year over year to $52.2 million\n* Gross profit increased 82% year over year to $86.7 million\n* Adjusted EBITDA increased 218% year over year to $40.4 million\n* SmartCast Active Accounta grew 57% year over year to 13.4 million\n* SmartCast Hours grew 70% year over year to 3.6 billion\n* Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) increased 76% year over year to $14.52\n\nAnd here\u2019s the part that gets me the most excited, Gross Profit from Platform is up 152% year over year. Vizio is already ranked #2 in best selling TV brand and #1 in best selling soundbars, and now they\u2019re going to start competing in the smart TV market. The king of the smart TV Market right now is Roku, controlling a [30% market share as of Q1 2021](https:\/\/9to5google.com\/2021\/05\/03\/roku-global-streaming-marketshare-drops\/#:~:text=Conviva%20reports%20(via%20Protocol)%20that,to%2030%25%20in%20Q1%202021.). The King is hurt right now, reeling from their awkward breakup with [Youtube TV](https:\/\/clark.com\/streaming-tv\/roku-announces-youtube-tv-breakup\/). Turns out Youtube TV actually prefers Vizio\u2019s [magnum dong](https:\/\/www.engadget.com\/vizio-smart-cast-owners-no-longer-need-two-apps-for-you-tube-132131066.html#:~:text=Just%20here%20to%20drop%20a,in%20the%20next%20few%20days.). I\u2019m willing to bet Vizio becomes a major player in the streaming market, plus they have the advantage of already being a huge TV manufacturer. Roku certainly got a head start, but we\u2019ve seen companies blow a 3-1 lead before \\*cough\\* Skype. We all know streaming is the future, and the future of Vizio\u2019s Smartcast (and by extension our tendies) right now is bright. And I\u2019m not the only one who thinks this, As of 6\/11\/2021 Vizio has 7 Buy ratings and a consensus price target of $30.29. For the mathematically challenged that\u2019s a *33.6%* upside from where the stock is now. Or put simply to any boomers skulking around, that\u2019s 3.36 years of returns compared to your boomer index S&P fund, and I\u2019m being fucking generous. \n\n# II. Catalysts\n\nVizio is getting into the data tracking\/advertisement business as well, recently reporting that they have just surpassed [11 million addressable enabled TVs](https:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20210609005230\/en\/VIZIO-Surpasses-11-Million-Addressable-Enabled-TVs) in the US. Why does this matter? It's yet another income stream for the TV manufacturing god, and one that has been insanely profitable for other companies. For those of you who live under a rock, almost all of these tech companies are competing for your data to sell to advertisers, and Vizio is finally getting into the game. We're only a few years away from lightspeed briefs ads being beamed into your dreams while you sleep, so for Vizio to start carving out a market share in this space I think is pretty significant. \n\n# III: Technicals\n\nHere\u2019s why I think VZIO can be a WWE junior.\n\n**Extremely low float:** The float on this is around 18 million shares, which is less than half of the float on WWE. And for you AMC and GME retards, Vizio\u2019s float is only 4% of AMC\u2019s and less than half of GME\u2019s. If you\u2019re still confused let me say it this way. If everyone subscribed to wallstreetbets wanted 2 shares there wouldn\u2019t be enough shares to go around. I\u2019ve been sniffing around and this is the lowest float non-bullshit stocks I\u2019ve been able to find. And by non-bullshit I mean Vizio actually has a respectable market cap and actually makes money. \n\n**Volume is low:** Volume is extremely low and trending lower. Average volume is only around 400k and has been trending downward ever since the IPO. \n\n**Options are cheap:** IV on this stock is only 54%. For reference, when CLNE popped the IV was around 80%. If there is any kind of volume spike this IV will go up considerably. It is crazy to me that the IV can be this low when the consensus price target has a 33% upside. \n\n**Moderate SI:** The SI is only moderate sitting at 7%, but still enough to cause some heartburn. And fuck it, it\u2019s you know what season. With the IV so low if the shorts were forced to cover we could see some serious tendies. \n\n**Huge Omega:** With the IV so low it won\u2019t take much movement for our options to print. The [Omega](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/o\/omega.asp), or elasticity is huge. For example, when Vizio went up 3.60% last Friday June 18 2021 Calls increased 84%, or an Omega of 23.4. Plus not only is the Omega large, the options chains are fucking *scarce.* July FDs only go up to $30 strike, and if you were paying attention to the Fundamentals section that\u2019s below their target price. \n\n# IV: Conclusion\n\nThis is my pick for a low-risk high reward play.  Its got everything I looked for plus the options are cheap. On the 3.6% move last Friday even my Nov 19 $25 calls went up 12%. It was fun riding the WWE tending train last week, and I think we could have a similar situation here. \n\nYou could even play this stock like a boomer (buy and hold, can\u2019t go tits up) and come out with some solid gains if we hit the consensus price target. I think the July 25C have a great chance of printing. I\u2019m personally holding shares, June 18 22.5 C, July 16 25 C, and Nov 19 25 C, and if this post gains traction here I'll probably add some 25C FDs. \n\nNot financial advice, buy some shares and options or don\u2019t, I don\u2019t really give a fuck. I just like the stock and the 32\" Vizio my mommy got me for birthday so I thought I'd share this post with you degenerates. I sit in front of a computer for a living so I\u2019m probably actually autistic.","166":"$CRSR DD Part 2 or why Corsair will swallow the gaming industry and be a 'millionaire maker' stock Sup apes. In my first [DD last week](https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/nxhh7d\/crsr_dd_or_why_you_should_park_all_your_cash_in\/), I gave a short rundown of why Corsair is incredibly undervalued, and how it should be in **everyone\u2019s portfolio**. With Part 2, I\u2019m addressing a lot of the comments I got as well as going a bit deeper into how Corsair will make this industry their bitch and reach ATH in 2021.  \n\n-\n\n\n**Why is Corsair in a strong position to leverage the gaming and streaming industry?**\n-\nCorsair didn\u2019t snooze, but rather spend the last years hunting for good companies to acquire. Being well funded, profitable and raking in cash every year allowed them to expand in all directions with a core focus on the fastest growing niche: Streaming. Have a look at their investor relations page:\n\n-\n\n*\u201cCorsair is a leading global provider and innovator of high-performance gear for gamers and content creators. Our industry-leading gaming gear helps digital athletes, from casual gamers to committed professionals, to perform at their peak across PC or console platforms, and our streaming gear enables creators to produce studio-quality content to share with friends or to broadcast to millions of fans.* \n\n*CORSAIR also includes subsidiary brands Elgato, which provides premium studio equipment and accessories for content creators, SCUF Gaming, which builds custom-designed controllers for competitive gamers, and **ORIGIN PC**, a builder of custom gaming and workstation desktop PCs and laptops.**\n\n-\nWith Elgato they positioned themselves years ago already to capitalize on one of the fastest growing entertainment subsegments (Streaming). While acquiring SCUF Gaming and ORIGIN PC allowed them to also expand and play in the console market as well as Pre Build PCs and laptops. **They basically moved up the ladder from RGB fans, keyboards, RAM sticks and Cases to EVERYTHING you need to play, stream or game properly.**\n\n**How much faster is Corsair really expanding?**\n-\n\nI cannot stress this enough, but their last quarter results really blew it completely out of the water. Seeing how they raised guidance, I think August will be even more brutal. One for value:\n\n* **$529.4 million** in net revenue, an increase of **71.6%** year-over-year. \n* **$175.9 million** net revenue for Gamer and creator peripherals segment, an increase of **131.9%** year-over-year.\n* Gross profit was **$160.3 million**, an increase of **103.9%** year-over-year, with a gross margin of 30.3%, an improvement of 480 basis points year-over-year. \n* Operating income was **$67.3 million**, an increase of **404.5%** year-over-year.\n* Adjusted operating income was **$80.4 million**, an increase of **221.4%** year-over-year.\n\n\n-\nDo yourself a favor and whip up a site like FinViz, punch in your favorite meme stock and have a look at their revenue number vs market cap. There\u2019s a reason why GME got picked up by DFV. Sales is still king and undervalued companies with aggressive growth have insane potential short and long term.\n\n-\n**Why hasn\u2019t it blown up yet to +100?**\n-\n\nThere is a good amount of chatter about two things. One being market manipulation, the other is that there is very little retail investor interest, compared to the amount of net sellers. The second point actually holds up, the stock never really got picked up by retail investors (or apes) and a lot of the commenters that did buy it up, mentioned how they were perfectly content with amassing shares every month while the price is still low. Pure but selfish value investing. \n\n-\n**Eagle What?**\n-\n\nThis one was also pointed out a lot. Corsair is owned by a private equity firm called EagleTree. They purchased the majority stake back in 2017 (which in turn allowed Corsair to expand much more aggressively) and now is obligated to reduce their share position over the next years until they only hold 10% of the company. \n\nThey currently hold 61.9%. The shares sold are mostly picked up by **Vanguard**, **Blackrock** and a few other small institutions, plus retail of course. Looking at insider transactions we can see that EagleTree usually sells shares twice a year with the last transaction happening **June 3rd 2021**. \n\nThis point doesn\u2019t concern me too much personally, as it\u2019s normal for private equity firms to reduce their stake after IPOs and Corsair is barely dipping $2 even with EagleTree selling 5 million shares. Now having sold their shares just now, it will probably be quiet for the next 6 months. \n\n-\n**Back to 2021 and how you can make money**\n-\n\nThey have a strong customer base which they've built up over the last 20 years, and thought f+ck it, let\u2019s go all in on this market. Tits and streaming? Amazing! Controllers for consoles? Let\u2019s do it. RGB Spinners on your lambo? Fuuckyea.\n\n-\n\nInstead of focusing on boring office peripherals that every Chinese company provides, they instead decided to slap RGB on everything and are loved for it. \n\n-\n\n**Now EagleTree is gonna continue doing what eagles do, and we will continue doing what apes do. I\u2019ll continue buying this company and watching their ER like a hawk while analysts jack themselves off over the sort of numbers Corsair hits out every quarter.**\n\n-\nI said it once, and I\u2019ll say it again. If you don\u2019t hold Corsair shares, you are pretty retarded. But since that\u2019s half the sub already, just do your wife\u2019s boyfriend a favour and pick up some shares while they are still dirt cheap. He will thank you for it once they hit **$70** or even blow through the stratosphere with **+$100.**\n\n-\n\n**TL:DR**\n\nCorsair CEO Smart. Put this in your boomer dad\u2019s portfolio (shares) and If you like gambling, buy some calls. \n\n-\n\nPosition: 100 shares at $33 and 12x 40$ Nov Calls. (yes I\u2019m poor, and you can do better).","167":"Vietnamese dong? So my exwife texted me a picture stating that some customers came in her restaurant and left her a tip of 300,000 Vietnamese dong.

Bee doo bee doo GME, AMC, CLOV, WKHS, SAVA, BB.","168":"A visual explanation to short squeezes The year of 2021 will be one filled with market anomalies, but the one that took the market by surprise was the Gamestop short squeeze that was driven by a rally to take on short sellers from the WallStreetBets subreddit. Although short squeezes may seem simple, they are a bit complex when you *look under the hood.* This publication is meant to graphically show how short squeezes happen as well providing the mechanics on why they occur.\n\n**The mechanics behind longs and shorts**\n\nTo understand short squeezes we have to understand the mechanics of *longs* and *shorts.* Most investors usually invest using by *going long* on a stock. This is when an investor purchases the stock and then hopefully sells it a higher price in the future. A *short seller* is when an individual wants to bet against a stock hoping that it falls. But instead of selling the stock at a higher price for a profit, they want to *buy the stock back* at a lower price, we\u2019ll get more into the short positions if this seems confusing now.\n\nShort sellers have all sort of motives, some short sellers are actively trying to take down companies (see activist [short sellers](https:\/\/www.hec.edu\/en\/knowledge\/articles\/how-activist-short-sellers-police-financial-markets#:~:text=Activist%20short%20sellers%20are%20a,corporate%20frauds%20or%20financial%20misstatements.)), some do it because they think the stock is overvalued, and others may do it to hedge out their portfolio (see [long short](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/l\/long-shortequity.asp#:~:text=Long%2Dshort%20equity%20is%20an%20investment%20strategy%20that%20seeks%20to,%2Dvalued%20and%20over%2Dvalued.) strategy).\n\nWe won\u2019t dive too deep on longs and shorts but below covers the relevant material to understand them. Here is a *simple* process for entering longs and shorts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/flhcbdv51p471.png?width=927&format=png&auto=webp&s=07b1a38557bb176decff9dca745e2118f3cbe623\n\nTo reiterate the most important part of these positions are\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/siavo5961p471.png?width=304&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f447c0639e8693a0f9e4ba887a0b76327470718\n\nWe can see that an investor that goes long has to **buy** to get into the position, and **sell,** to get out of the position. And a short seller has to **sell** to get into a position and **buy** to get out. (The technical terms for the short seller are **selling short,** and **buying to cover**).\n\n**Price Discovery Analysis**\n\nTo analyze a stock\u2019s price we will use the price discovery method. We\u2019ll start with a standard supply and demand curve for modeling stock prices. Although this explanation works in theory and the mechanics behind this model are applicable in real life, it is technically impossible to know the future movement of supply and demand curves. To do so would require one to know all of current and potential investors\u2019 future decisions, which are hard to predict.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/p2a50m371p471.png?width=1094&format=png&auto=webp&s=2de58d6059ff1b46277d814224cbdae8f6538fe1\n\nIn this simple representation where supply stays constant, an increase in demand leads to a higher price and a decrease in demand leads to a lower price.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/9zviv8r71p471.png?width=1394&format=png&auto=webp&s=6832c9ff03e755ef89c5c94028f8a31dbcd3ef2e\n\nEven though keeping supply constant is **not technically accurate,** it provides for a better visual explanation later\\*\\*.\\*\\* In general, changes in supply would mean that there are less or more sellers in the market.\n\n**Orderbook analysis**\n\nTo analyze movements in the stock we will examine the *orderbook*, which displays the type of order and the quantity of orders for a certain price. It shows how prices change with incoming bids and asks. The *bids* are the orders to buy the stock and the and the *asks* are the orders to sell the stock. In stock trading there is usually a slight difference between bids and asks (the *spread*), we can see that the spread between the highest bid ($125.82) and the lowest ask ($126.80). A *transaction* doesn\u2019t occur until bid and ask agree upon a price (which would look like an order on each side of the price). So in this case if you were looking to buy the stock you would have to meet the lowest ask which is $126.80.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/3uaq33l81p471.png?width=236&format=png&auto=webp&s=a599b5d90613f08f5a053d54d33e0d7e67bdfa56\n\nThis is a sample orderbook that I found from [TradingView](https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/). A live orderbook would be filled with a number of bids and asks in each column. Orderbook information can be found in your brokerage account if you have access to level II market data. I like to think of orderbook dynamics as forces moving against each other. For example if there are more buyers than sellers then, the green vector will be bigger than the red vector which will push the price up. If there are more sellers than buyers then the red vector will be bigger, which will push prices down.\n\nThe following is a different visual representation of bids and asks that shows volume. Looking at the bids (*green)* we can see that there is a preference to buy the stock at a lower price. As for the asks (*red*) the majority of sellers are looking to sell the stock at higher price.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/48bp2v491p471.png?width=558&format=png&auto=webp&s=e5e87c7ed77f97c6951b30cac740d3469e063406\n\n**Gamestop Example**\n\nNow let\u2019s get into the mechanics behind a short squeeze, and in this case we will look at the Gamestop short squeeze which garnered a great deal of attention recently.\n\nIn this example we will start with 7 short positions. Each short position comes from a different short seller. We can see on the aggregate that the stock is downward trending for the most part. This works in the best interest of the short seller who **sells the stock and hopes to buy it back at a cheaper price**, and they will profit from the **difference**. We can also see that the short sell positions are represented with the *green* *profit bar* below the price they entered in at.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ojczn2t91p471.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&s=65987f0347a0ce2bed614323ceccab066a83f3cf\n\nNow let\u2019s talk about how the short seller\u2019s position may go awry. If the stock price increases which isn\u2019t what the short seller wants and they begin to lose money, then are going to want to exit their position. Keep in mind that **exiting** a short position requires **buying** the stock back. This is *the bug* in short selling, its this little feature that creates a short squeeze. Let\u2019s say a short seller wants out, they\u2019ll buy the stock back, but also going back to our price discovery method, buying a stock **increases the demand**, which **increases the price**.\n\nThis is where the squeeze occurs, each short seller **exits** their position which pushes the price up, causing the next short seller to lose money.\n\nThe timeline of trades would look like this.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/qu3rdfma1p471.png?width=690&format=png&auto=webp&s=037cfe11ab1b3d42c0340167076f541828a48f62\n\nGraphically it would look like this with the price on left side and the supply and demand on the right side. We can see that when the short seller buys the stock back they increase the demand which increases price.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/og7139gb1p471.png?width=1891&format=png&auto=webp&s=d505e0a7ddc97c446fd4cf90f6beb413dec217d8\n\nWe can see that when this all starts to happen the price can dramatically increase.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/2zvr183c1p471.png?width=1548&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c50d93d517fff2c4c6d58d27b7761cd358452f4\n\n**Why Short Squeezes happen**\n\nThe main factor that contributes to short squeezes is that a short seller who is looking to exit their position has to **buy** the stock which pushes the price up, and that hits the next seller and so forth.\n\nSome short squeezes may occur naturally, although they rarely do. This can happen if a stock posts good quarterly results or makes a positive announcement. That increase in price could trigger a short squeeze. For example when famed activist short seller Citron Research ran by Andrew Left switched his short position on Tesla Inc, that created a short squeeze(see [here](https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2018\/10\/23\/short-seller-who-is-suing-tesla-changes-his-mind-tesla-is-destroying-the-competition.html)).\n\nIf short sellers succeed and push the price of the stock down then there is a risk that a short squeeze may occur. *Contrarian investors* which are investors that take *go against the grain* approach in investing may bet on a company who\u2019s price is falling. Their purchase may cause a short squeeze, and its common for contrarian investors to try and garner public support which would rally investors. Value investors who constantly ask \u201c*is this stock overvalued or undervalued?\u201d* may see a stock that has been falling because of short sellers and say that its undervalued and buy up a bunch of shares causing a short squeeze.\n\nBut the most famous short squeezes that are studied come from market manipulation. This occurs when a trader or group of traders realize that with a large enough buy order will push the price up triggering a short squeeze.\n\nAlthough it feels like short squeezes have been happening a lot with talks about *meme stocks*, they actually don\u2019t occur too often. I would assume that as markets calm when our lives fully revert back to normal (or whatever normal is post-pandemic) there will be less of these events.","169":"With Vaccine Rollout in NZ, and future plans for border re-opening in 2022-24 Hey fellow apes, first time posting after being introduced to you through GME (bought @ 300+ and when it dipped to $90, earned my chicken tenders to say the least)\nAs I know there is a lot of stocks from GME, AMC, Palantir, etc. catching a lot of interest, I want to bring you guys some information from doing some DD in New Zealand where I am currently living and why you should look to put some money aside as the bounce-back for airlines comes into play with vaccine roll-out and sequentially border re-opening, especially those that are more affordable, namely Air NZ, and Qantas, but not limited to.\n\nAs you may know when Countries ran full restricted lockdowns, air-travel via tourism and delivery of goods via air (not only) received a huge economic hit.\nDuring the increase of cases leading up to the lockdown, there was a huge dip in stock price from Air NZ, Qantas, and namely Air Canada as well as Delta airlines for you guys in the US.  It all hit relatively at the same time between Feb 2020 - March 2020, when the pandemic spiked.\n\nSome airlines especially larger economies such as Canada and US airlines stocks are recovering. In order, Air Canada @ Peak 47$ dropped to $12.41 and is currently @ 27. Delta (one of many US airlines) @ Peak ~60$ dropped to 22$ and is now @ 48$.\n\nSimilarly, Qantas (Australia) @ peak 6.50$ dropped to 2.36$ and is now 4.71$ (it was closer to 8$ @ peak but it dropped a bit before it fell off completely at the timestamps, so keeping things specific to the pandemic)\n\nFinally, Air NZ @ peak $3.00, dropped to 80 \u00a2 and is back up to $1.63. Now I don't expect insane % increases the likes of what we see in e-commerce, and that of the diamond handed folk of WSB, but as the economy begins to recover over the next few years and Air travel for tourism and goods will return, expect the stock to return to normal (or increase as tourism will increase as borders re-open)\n\nI have more DD from ministry of health vaccine roll-out plans (publicly available and being a health student am now able to receive my vaccine) that lets me know that the current turnaround to have everyone vaccinated with relation to achieving herd immunity, and previous vaccine data of other diseases let's me know that it will be a few years before a solid rebound occurs.\n\nDD of publicly available GDP sources of our economy in the form of tourism and recognizing over-stock of perishables in wholesale, etc. That I can explain in another post.\n\nDD of previous cases namely Oil and gas, traumatic events and a variety of others that plummeted stock prices that have recovered to-date.\n\nNow I am not one to say it is good to be making money knowing it is because of the cost of lives lost that resulted in it. But I don't expect to be using this money on myself, you all have shown me what good can come from your donations, and I plan to do the same, or at least take care of my family.\n\nP.S, not a financial advisor, the whole 9 yards, you know the drill. Thanks DFV\/Roaring Kitty, you have been teaching me a lot w\/ those 4+ hour streams.\n\nI hope if anything, helps give you guys insight to start looking into this, to expand your portfolio if you decide to.","170":"$CRSR DD or why you should park all your cash in this crazy undervalued tech company Sup apes. Your favourite fruit is back for some sweet DD ($CRSR) that will catapult your shitty portfolio into the stratosphere. \n  \n\n\n  Ever heard of Corsair?\n-\nThey are the boys that fill your neat gaming PC full of dope parts. Not only are they a giant in this industry since their inception in 1994, they also got publicly listed last October for a measly **$15.**\n\n-\n\nNow, why should you care?\n-\n\nCorsair has all the properties that can make it THE stock of the decade for WSB - think AMD before they went from $4 to $80, now this time it's from $30 to $300.\n\n-\n\n**1.DeepF#ckingValue**\n-\n\nTheir current market cap stands at **3.12B** on **1.92B sales** and **148m profit.** That\u2019s insane in itself, their current market cap is minuscule and should be at least 5x their revenue. They are making cash hand over fist every quarter and are already a crazy growth rocket. \n\n\n \n\n-\nAs per recent earnings article: *\u201cMajor industry tailwinds seem to be helping Corsair achieve strong growth rates. In the first quarter, its overall revenue grew 72% year over year to $529 million. The company also continues to see improved profitability, as gross margin jumped from 25.5% a year ago to 30.3%.\u201d*\n\n\n-\n**2.Tiny float**\n-\n\nThey IPO\u2019d with only 91.95 million shares outstanding and a float of 88.4 million. This entire sub could outright buy the company out. Jokes aside, this isn't moving a 500m share giant like NOKIA, but rather like your beer filled kiddiepool.\n**3.Cheap Options**\n-\nFlat movement for the last months meaning LOW IV and CHEAP option prices. $40 Calls on November are $2. And long term leaps at $50 barely cost $1.40. Since inception last year, their shares went from $15 to $54 in the span of a couple months. This rally died off when people finally decided to take profits after the IPO. But if options are too rich for you, it's still an excellent time to buy shares and park your cash there while the run up to $50 happens.\n\n**4.Low Risk** \n-\nAlways arguable, but This company just IPOed, is healthy and makes tons of cash. No risk of bankruptcy looming around the corner, or shares being diluted if it his 50$ or 100$. YOU CAN SAFELY PARK YOUR YOLO'd CASH without the company blowing up any second.\n\n**What else?**\n\nAnalysts on SA have a big raging one for CRSR. (link in comments) and there is a very possible breakout about to happen + earnings coming up in August.\n\n\n\nNow what company fits better for millions of Gamestop apes? A Gaming company that will fill every GameStop with little ram sticks and gaming gear. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n\n\n** TL:DR ** $CRSR is a good bet that could safely triple your money...

Based on my intensely quantitative research, there is a \\~1\/3 probability of getting the correct item (i.e. the rest of the time, you get something else). Delivery time is usually a few weeks to forever (i.e. you may never receive your order).\n\nWish\u2019s main competitive advantages are the following:\n\n**1.** **Plethora of unique items:** Wish is home to some very unique items that you won\u2019t be able to find elsewhere. Best of all, the stuff is real cheap - all apes will be able to afford Wish products even if you blew up 99% of your account in the casino!

This DD covers just 3 points. I've compared BBBY with its main competitors: Target (TGT), Gap (GPS), and Walmart (WMT).\n\n1. Huge short interest as % float. In BBBY, it's 32%. That's a shit-ton of bananas if this thing pops. Keep in mind, that's just the official percentage. We all remember how GME was supposedly not being shorted anymore, right?  \ud83e\udd21  Here is the short as % of float in BBBY's competitors:   \nGAP = 6%  \nTGT = 2%  \nWMT = 1%\n2. Forward-looking P\/E. Now, I know division requires more toes and fingers than you've got (you might have to use your wife's boyfriend's), but take my word for it: forward-looking price\/earnings ratio is a pretty fucking big deal. The lower it is, the more reasonably the stonk is priced. With BBBY, it's 16. With its competitors:  \nGAP = 14  \nTGT = 19  \nWMT = 22\n3. Last but not least, fucking Cramer... I know he's an amoral piece of shit manipulator with access to tens of millions of boomers. I know he tried to fuck us over on GME and other stonks waaaay too many times. But at the same time, he's pumping up BBBY like there's no tomorrow. Did you know that BB spiked up from $8 on zero actual news? The catalyst (that's a thing that makes a rocket go BOOM) was some CNBC guest quickly saying he had some BB calls. The whole thing was just 10 seconds long, but it set off a spike to $10, and the rest was history. If a simple 10-second segment can do that to a grotesquely over-shorted stonk... All I'm saying is that I anticipate a boomer stampede to BBBY sooner rather than later.\n\nAnd that's it - plain and simple.

The borrow fee rate is not the short interest; that is the number of shares shorted. \n\nThe borrow fee rate is the amount it costs per year to short a share, as shorting requires borrowing. To put it into perspective, for a costant price, a yearly borrow fee rate of 116.7% would imply a daily cost of paying 0.3197% of the value of the shorted share.\n\n0.32% in the world of returns is a lot. \n\nYesterday, the short interest rate on CLOV was 43.54% (https:\/\/twitter.com\/ihors3\/status\/1402368431291314177?s=20). This number might be lower now, as the borrowing fee rate depends on other factors (volatility, ease of locating shares) than just the supply available; shorts may have covered a bit. It will, however, not be a lot lower. What this implies is that for some 30%-50% of the number of shares available on CLOV, the shorts are paying 0.32% of the price of the share just for holding the position, every. single. day. \n\nThe shorts are absolutely bleeding buckets. In fact, this situation, including the drop today, is incredibly similar to GME; I dare say even more so than AMC. Another great buy, support each other please.\n\nI currently hold multiple call options comprising 19% of my portfolio, and that's only because GME takes up 60%.\n\nObligatory rocket emojis \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nEdit: Since I made this thread I received a lot of good, confirming information, which I would like to summarize here:\n\n- The short interest rate is currently at 50.42% according to Ortex.\n\n- https:\/\/fintel.io\/shortSqueeze model states CLOV is currently most likely to squeeze.\n\n- questrade Canada also has a borrow fee of 59%.\n\n- Additionally https:\/\/www.shortsight.com\/ shows that CLOV has a bullish sentiment with a low share availability score of 4, meaning shares are confirmed really limited across the board. This means multiple brokerages are confirmed to have a hard time locating shares. That is huge. Remember what caused GME to not be allowed to be bought anymore? Borrowing fee rates were high for a ton of brokers, and some, including IBKR and Robinhood, had these high borrowing rates in place because they were running out of shares to locate. They could no longer provide the shares they are obligated to provide to those who either want to short or buy the share. And hence they shut both down, as otherwise the brokerages themselves would trigger an insane and instant shortsqueeze. An incredible indicator.\n\nEdit 2: More rocket emojis: \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80","181":"What Are Your Moves Tomorrow, June 10, 2021 CLOV, BB, and CLNE discussion can be found in the [Popular Ticker Thread](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/nvsynu\/daily_popular_tickers_thread_for_june_09_2021\/) thread!\n\n#[GME Earnings Megathread](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/nvs3c6\/gme_q1_earnings_megathread)","182":"SNDL having the highest Short-Interest Score on Bloomberg Terminal!!

Is it time to go balls deep in $TWNK for Pride month \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08 ? Last week I saw Hostess ($TWNK) mentioned by someone in the daily thread. The ticker caught my eye and inspired me to do some DD into the company. Here is what I found:\n\n* Hostess was taken public after filing and emerging for bankruptcy in 2012. Since then it has has strong revenue growth over the past 20 quarters\n* The company is now highly profitable and it has weathered the pandemic well.  Gross profit in the past 12 months has been $371 Million, up 39% compared to two years ago.\n* Hostess is funneling much of its profits into its business for future growth. It is also rapidly growing its [market share in the Sweet Baked Goods category](https:\/\/www.hostessbrands.com\/static-files\/e20aeeb6-2880-4278-a362-f222573d81f6)\n* The company is in the process of reinventing itself and the products it offers. They have announced plans and capital expenditures to break into the morning convenience food market.\n* They have also recently expanded their leadership team and appointed [this absolute stud](https:\/\/www.bizjournals.com\/kansascity\/news\/2021\/05\/28\/hostess-chief-growth-officer-dan-oleary.html) as their new Chief Growth Officer.\n* Altogether this puts TWNK is in the much-coveted position of being both a value (think Warren buffett) and growth (thing Bill hwang) type stock. At the moment, there is no dividend as the company is reinvesting cash into its business for future growth, but there are plans for future stock buybacks in 2022 and beyond.\n* ANALysts love the stock. The consensus from analysts is Very Bullish (out of the 11 analysts that have covered the stock, 2 TWNK is a strong buy, 6 say its a buy, and 3 say its a hold.\n\n*Now let\u2019s talk shorts*\n\n* Short interest is 20.77% of the float  That\u2019s higher than most meme tickers here (comparable to AMC GME, much higher than BB, WEN, etc). Furthermore, short interest has [increased 44%](https:\/\/www.marketbeat.com\/stocks\/NASDAQ\/TWNK\/short-interest\/) since the start of January are we\u2019re starting to see a number of pops this spring from [failed to deliver shares](https:\/\/sec.report\/fails.php?tc=TWNK).\n* The stock has very low volume right now (only an average of 1.2M shares traded per day). If a squeeze were to happen, at the current volume it would take shorts a month to cover.\n* Additionally, 123.67% of all the float is held by institutions, and very little by retail meaning that any significant volume will send the stock flying.\n* If TWNK turns into a crusade against shorty, I could see us squeezing to $69. *Right the stock is only at a 2B market cap so there\u2019s plenty of room to grow*\n\nThat\u2019s about it thank you for reading to the end. Despite the meme potential and parallels to GME, this stock has surprisingly flown under this sub\u2019s radar so far .

Melvin and Shitadel spy - The citadel employee who is just here to spread misinformation and cause panic. Probably deployed here for some more nefarious purposes. After seeing something that could be dangerous to them, they go and pay Motley Fool to write some negative article about it.\n2. Gold diggers - Greedy people who lurk around hoping to catch signs of next craze and make a fortune by \"buying low and selling high.\" Always on the lookout for the next hype.\n3. Diamonds Hands - The big boys of WSB. Actually know they are doing and don't post a bunch of crap about TSLA short-squeezing or the next GME. Only group to hold significant amounts of shares.\n4. Noobs (Paper hands) - The 8 year olds that are just here cause they think its cool. Only have 1\/2 a share of GME and talk like they have 100. Selling a the slightest dip.\n5. Paper traders - Also noobs but don't even actually trade. Trade on Wall Street Survivor or some other hypothetical trade website and think that what their doing is the real deal. Then they hop onto WSB and post crap DD\n6. Pump and Dumpers (Also schemers and scammers) - Market manipulators who try to influence the noobs in subtle ways, such as through their rhetorical DD and fake technical analysis. Buy at the dip of some random stock then try to hype on WSB for their own profit.\n7. Meme makers - Average traders who make meme content and funny videos. They're the ones who bring the culture to WSB.\n\nThanks for reading! Tell me if I should add anything!","191":"$CLOV - Will the Real Meme Please Stand Up? Given all the hype lately around meme-ageddon and the explosion in price movement, volume, and sentiment around everyone's favorite \"meme\" stocks lately, I thought I'd do a simple (really, really simple) comparative analysis based on 6 month charts of some of go-to tickers.\n\n**My purpose in doing so?** To see if we can establish a trend and differentiate these stocks in any meaningful way.\n\n**Why do I think this is important?** The \"squeeze\" narrative has been used a lot since Jan following the parabolic movements of several stocks. Since then, I feel that all \"squeeze\" and \"meme\" stocks have been psychologically grouped as the same, but their trends show they are not.\n\n**The simple hypothesis?** We should be able to easily differentiate the Jan stocks as compared to any of the others that gained attention post-January.\n\nThere was a defined and unique occurrence that took place back in Jan surrounding $GME, $AMC, $BB, $KOSS, $NOK, $BBBY, and Express. Since then, we have seen a wave of \"short squeeze\" narratives for other tickers, but the difference around the January stocks was how they appeared to all move in tandem and have a relatively strong correlation, setting them apart, and potential pointing to some broader scheme involved utilizing naked shorting and resulting in massive FTDs.\n\nIt goes to say this is an anomaly and I believe these stocks should be looked at differently when compared with other \"squeeze\" and \"meme\" stocks being pushed.\n\n**Side Note:** For these charts, all tickers will be set to full screen scaling on Trading View in order to see how closely their trends in price action move together, so it's not comparative of current price per share but of their general movements, when those movements took place, and individual gains.\n\nSome of the \"squeeze\" stocks that followed January's events, $CLOV, $RKT, and $MVIS, compared with $GME over a 6 month basis. $GME because it was the most notable Jan stock historically until recently.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[It may not be as apparent from this first picture, but there is divergence in these stocks trends. I would argue the second half of the chart appears more correlated because everything became sentimentally grouped together as \\\\\"meme\\\\\" stocks after the MSM started pumping WSB narratives for everything.](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/3jgm7j8rl1471.png?width=3335&format=png&auto=webp&s=457655244d8a809517d4a68c9ce168804f2d2f41)\n\nIt may not be as apparent from this first picture, but there is divergence in these stocks trends. I would argue the second half of the chart appears more correlated because everything became sentimentally grouped together as \"meme\" stocks after the MSM started pumping WSB narratives for everything.\n\n**What can I infer from this, just from looking at it?**\n\n$CLOV has done its own thing until closer to late March when it first started getting attention (again) after the massive influx of WSB participants post-Jan. Even so, if you look close enough, it has peaks and valleys that move against the trend of $GME.\n\n$MVIS also definitely follows its own tune.\n\n$RKT is actually the one of these 3 that looks like it could follow $GME, but it didn't \"squeeze\" in Jan with the others. It had a massive run up in the beginning of March that sticks out against the others.\n\nIt appears to me that it was really around March that this psychological collective was starting to be established as we see a little less divergence in trends, though they are still identifiable as different.\n\nNow compare $GME and $AMC. Although $AMC didn't run up in March, if you study these lines, you can see there consistent moves up and down at the same time as $GME until recently May.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[AMC bucked the trend the past few weeks and reached highs greater than the Jan peak.](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/fwbvwknvl1471.png?width=3323&format=png&auto=webp&s=330b350435447aabf0827de1b0f003ccb5e20d32)\n\nAMC bucked the trend the past few weeks and reached highs greater than the Jan peak.\n\nThe other 3 without $GME on the chart.\n\n[Kinda all over the place when you look at them in isolation and compared to each other.](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/af55m8gxl1471.png?width=3325&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1ceacfa257d8c8db7ec97530f0f5e3143a53221)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKinda all over the place when you look at them in isolation and compared to each other.\n\nNow if you're not sure there seems to be that much divergence, look at the Jan stocks together.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Because Big Money got scared and said fuck you](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/fk3i4r6am1471.png?width=3324&format=png&auto=webp&s=2806febf5c6904813f452ea47f165a322418f85e)\n\nJanuary peak when they triple fucked us says it all.\n\nThis may be a shoddy effort to show the differences I'm trying to highlight, but I think if anyone were to take the time to play around with some charts and overlay the tickers, you can see just from basic visual analysis that there is extreme similarity in all of the Jan stocks over 6 months, suggesting they are in their own bucket entirely independent of other \"meme\" stocks.\n\nIf we take the time to compare Jan stocks 1 on 1 with others, it highlights this difference.\n\nI'll use Express here because no one talks about it but it has Jan stock correlation. This tells me that it isn't sentiment driven and is seemingly moving with other Jan stocks for another reason that isn't \"retail\" pumping it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Express and CLOV](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ns66q7mzl1471.png?width=3337&format=png&auto=webp&s=a43dc1801e4f19503b88e13e7850d6cf09a01eea)\n\n[Express and RKT](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/c5gglej0m1471.png?width=3334&format=png&auto=webp&s=4af8b13a259c703ea76d6fccfa5417f773001caf)\n\n[Express and MVIS](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/1jw67jw1m1471.png?width=3335&format=png&auto=webp&s=04483e9f508589c143e4f3fe1a858ebf647efb9d)\n\n[Express and UWMC](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/erqfqgz2m1471.png?width=3330&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b5f08737f56ea50e6ae132e8ea8e11b9e73b8ae)\n\n**Why did I bother to go through all of this?**\n\nI think it's important to provide some distinction between the events of Jan and those respective stocks as compared to the more recent favorites. I'm not saying what will or will not \"squeeze,\" but I do think it's important to separate the narratives around \"meme\" stocks when evaluating risk and trying to understand what influences a particular stock.\n\nIf this wasn't so long already and if I had the character limit, I'd give my interpretation of the time line, when and why certain narratives formed, and how it's important, but I think the charts says enough.","192":"We Need Separate Daily Megathreads For GME \/ AMC \/ BB \/ CLOV Having a hundred BB posts a day is pulling out momentum AMC and GME have from this community.

This is a significant pivot point, it's the first time the price dips below $145 after that strong leg up in 2021. It also represents a higher low from that initial dip in the first 5 trading days **and the substantial increase in liquidity** **was bought** \\- lockup had expired so plenty of shares sold from insiders for tax purposes, lock gains, etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Second entry: consolidation and breakout from bottom](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/veek8ng511471.png?width=2379&format=png&auto=webp&s=2eddc663817c3f526ed5b6a4a2139239800ea6db)\n\nSecond entry point: that nice and clean breakout; RSI kept increasing and price consolidated, a round handle on the lows. I expected more resistance at the $145 but it flew past it. If it looks like a bottom, behaves like a bottom and feels like a bottom - it has to be a bottom.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, that's all fun and all but you're here because you want tendies and you can't go back in time and buy calls - bet you'd like that now tho.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut wait, there's more:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[bullish flag with big volume gap](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/4i8g5ec811471.png?width=2384&format=png&auto=webp&s=28dcc91b7e940b7f97029887511b946fc93e937f)\n\nThere's the magic! A perfect bullish flag with a **big volume gap above $150**. Let's recap: IPO priced at $65 and public debut at $145; price jumps to $175 - $200 range within 20 trading days and stays within that range for 4 months post Q4 earnings and **even as growth stocks sold off** during the trading rotation \/ inflation scare; $ABNB starts selling off with very little volume (hence the volume gap) 2 weeks before the lock-up period expires; liquidity tsunami at the bottom and increased selling from insiders post-IPO; liquidity is bought and price goes up, then consolidates. \n\nConclusion: there was very little interest in buying from $180 to $130 just before lock-up period expired. So it just took a few smart traders to dump positions 2 weeks before to make a killing. But there is significant buying interest now as the past days clearly show and there won't be volume resistance going up. This is a great setup for a very quick and very profitable rebound.

Summer is not cancelled. In the EU, almost all the population above 50 is vaccinated and in the US and UK even higher vaccination rates have been achieved. The clear effect: hospitals, deaths, ICUs are not going to get as pressured as they were last year. And that is the main driver for government decision to close up borders and lose the much needed tourism revenue over the summer. It's a great buy the FUD occasion for the hospitality industry in general but even more for $ABNB: no lockdowns = short term stays; some lockdowns = higher long term rentals; complete lockdowns = wfh from the beach. 62% of $ABNB summer nights in NYC booked are for long term stays and 24% of bookings in Q1 were for more than 28 days.

(disclaimer: I'm NOT here to help)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is what you're missing:\n\nThe way GME happened, the way BB and AMC and MVIS and BNGO happened, isn't by your FOMO fool ass jumping in (actually the tail part of it is but we'll get to that later), it happened because DD's occurred with critical analysis of stocks that were undervalued were placed here, and some smart people OTHER than you read it and understood it.  They bought and held for months, bringing up the floor value of the stock long enough that some other reasonably smart but less responsible investors took notice.  Then when they got in the price went up more, until a LOT of people noticed.  A lot of YOU people.  Of course you jumped in with FOMO, but you jumped in as they started selling off.  Then you started posting desperate attempts to get the stock to go up but you have no karma and have nothing meaningful to add so your paosts got filtered and all you could do is post \"me too\" like some brain dead AOL'er on other peoples posts.  \n\nThe era of GME and 80+ percent shorted stocks is gone now.  You changed that.  You didn't profit from it but you got the frenzy going, participated in it, and kicked Melvin's ass.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo what to do now?  Stop chasing! Yes you might win a casino bet concerning AMC now but ultimately (and AMC agrees), the stock is way over valued now and most of you are going to lose money.  Also, like all casino bets, ultimately the casino wins.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEvery once in a while a stock comes up here that is undervalued and has enough short interest, etc, that you might get a nice gamma squeeze out of it.  I think the best bet is to look at those, CRITICALLY, and decide if it's worth throwing in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTHEN WAIT.\n\nIf the stock is actually undervalued (like BB, AMC, GME were originally), you might get a nice pop, an incredible pop even.  But patience is key, and even if you don't get a pop the stock will still do well.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo what does this have to do with ASO?  Well its undervalued, fairly shorted, mostly institutionally owned, and waiting to get noticed.  Should you buy?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWELL  IT'S TOO LATE!!!!!!!!  \n\nTHE STOCK ANNOUNCES EARNINGS TOMORROW MORNING YOU IDIOT!!! TOO LATE TO BUY CALLS.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI WARNED YOU BUT YOU DIDN'T LISTEN TO ME.

(NYSE:AMC), BlackBerry Limited (NYSE:BB), GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) and Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (NASDAQ:BBBY) should focus on the upcoming inflation data that will be published this week, according to an analyst.\n\nWhat Happened: Steve Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Securities, told CNBC that investors in the so-called stonks, or shares favored by the retail crowd, must focus on May\u2019s consumer price index (CPI) that will be reported Thursday.\n\nThe CPI data could be a catalyst for the U.S. Federal Reserve to reverse its easy monetary policy. The Fed\u2019s next monetary policy meeting is scheduled for June 15-June 16.\n\nNoting that the market looks too expensive, Massocca said that while the retail trading mania is just one sign, a hawkish comment from the Fed could also trigger a sell-off. He believes the market is setting up for a 7% to 10% pullback at some point.\n\n\u201cWho knows what starts it. ... One of the candidates very likely will be some kind of reductions in monetary policy,\u201d the analyst reportedly said.\n\nDan Niles, the founder of Satori Fund, was quoted as saying that he is staying away from stocks that are heavily sought by retail investors or stocks that have large short interest and are targeted by Wall Street.","196":"$BB - Blackberry to participate in upcoming Investor Conference 9 Jun 2021 Blackberry will be discussing the latest developments in BlackBerry\u2019s technology and strategy, which is something I sure a lot of investors and a lot of us will be interested in listening to.\n\nLink: [https:\/\/www.blackberry.com\/us\/en\/company\/newsroom\/press-releases\/2021\/blackberry-to-participate-in-upcoming-baird-investor-conference](https:\/\/www.blackberry.com\/us\/en\/company\/newsroom\/press-releases\/2021\/blackberry-to-participate-in-upcoming-baird-investor-conference)\n\nBB holds up on its own.

Who knows, by Wednesday this shit shoots to $20 or more.\n\nAnd now my honest opinion - fuck all the moon shit, because frankly all I see happening is people left at the peaks holding bags. You want to do something with BB, just like GME and AMC?

Experts are already stating that this salad is the salad of the summer. See attached citation for review.  ([https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/wendys-brings-back-seasonal-summer-strawberry-chicken-salad-301306465.html](https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/wendys-brings-back-seasonal-summer-strawberry-chicken-salad-301306465.html))\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Second,** Wendys social media profile is no stranger to memes. Everyone has seen the \"Roast Me\" thing that Wendys has been doing. Well this will only increase with fellow autists supporting it. Academics have called this term \"metapragmatic roasting\" and its incredibly effective with the younger generation. Here is a chart demonstrating the breakdown of their tweets.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https:\\\/\\\/www.sciencedirect.com\\\/science\\\/article\\\/pii\\\/S0378216620301120#fig3](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/loppdub5mu371.png?width=357&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8c5b8485a2ab060d6c7f2a8585230fbd11dd707)\n\nHere is another article from business daily demonstrating the effectiveness of Wendys perceived social media presence. [https:\/\/journal.businesstoday.org\/bt-online\/2018\/wendys-twitter-presence-the-art-of-creating-beef-over-beef](https:\/\/journal.businesstoday.org\/bt-online\/2018\/wendys-twitter-presence-the-art-of-creating-beef-over-beef)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Third**, Both Gamestop and Wendys have been sharing in this Social Media \"Beef\" or \"Metapragmatic Roasting\" of each other. Their Twitter profiles are actively following each other and going off each others posts. See the below image for an example. ([https:\/\/twitter.com\/gamestop\/status\/1224739308013309952?lang=en](https:\/\/twitter.com\/gamestop\/status\/1224739308013309952?lang=en))\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Coincidence? ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/zug6vms5nu371.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=2144efe81af5d11abfd7702386aa5301defef822)\n\n**Forth, well this one is obvious but Wendys Chicken Tendies. Literally the perfect stock for this sub.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo lets talk technical. Supposedly $WEN (Wendy's) has a low public float of around 17 million shares. It has between a 4-10% short which will increase as the stock increases because fast food retail is a relatively predictable stock (Same reason why Utility Companies will get shorted to shit when they rise look at $NEE earlier this year).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith an average volume of around 1 Million per day there is a huge amount of Alpha to be had in investing in Wendys. Right now the Implied Volatility on options is tiny (29-34%) which means that you can get a position for pennies on the dollar. Further, buying shares is small as well as its currently not a volatile company. Either way its a good investment because of the Salad.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIm in at $22.97 and calls expiring on January of next year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is not financial advice, I am not a financial advisor. I just really like the stock, and Wendys.","199":"CLOV - Big Daddy of All Squeezes DD **UPDATE 6\/08\/2021: The squeeze has not happened yet, CLOV is set up nicely for both massive short squeeze and gamma squeeze. Not a single share has been covered, in fact there were more borrows this week (yes Hedges are shameless). I also want to emphasize on the lock up period for CLOV. The insiders cannot sell a single class B shares until the price is $30 for at least 90 consecutive days and have 700 million in cash so no need to fear any insider dumping\/dilution like other companies. I have not sold any shares. I expect a much much bigger return for my investment**\n\nI want to start off by saying this is not a post comparing CLOV to GME or AMC. While these stocks have some similarities, particularly being targeted by hedge funds for short squeezes, I\u2019m not going to get into that. This post is for anyone who is somewhat new to investing, still learning about shorts and squeezes, and those of you who are more knowledgeable but want the full picture of what\u2019s going on with this stock. You can also think of this post as a Part 2 to [my previous post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/CLOV\/comments\/ngesez\/this_is_the_bottom_and_youll_be_top_of_the_world\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). Brief description of my last post - it was about the stock reaching its bottom at $6.80 and only going up from there (which was correct).\n\n**TL;DR - Currently, the highest number of options purchased have a strike price between $7-18 for every single month. The goal is to stay above $12 to create a snowball of options being executed, thereby causing a gamma squeeze - the higher the strike price, the higher the limit to execute and the hedges are worse off.**\n\n**What Is Clover Health?**\n\nClover Health is not just another insurance company. They have combined Medicare insurance services with new patient-centered technology aimed at facilitating the ease and effectiveness of diagnosis, treatment, and most importantly, prevention. This company should not be classified as a health insurance company, but a tech company. Their AI learning and database, Clover Assistant, make it easier for providers to eliminate unnecessary and repetitive lab testing, repetitive diagnoses, and it consolidates a patient\u2019s medical history into one platform. This not only saves the patient headaches from navigating our decentralized healthcare system, but it also saves both patients and insurance companies an enormous amount of money by avoiding duplicated efforts. \n\nCurrently, CLOV covers 66,300 customers across 8 states out of the 61,212,247 Medicare beneficiaries nationwide, which equates to .0011% of the beneficiary population. As you can tell, this number is extremely low, which makes sense since they are a brand new company. When they reach even 1% of the beneficiaries, this company\u2019s stock price would be $100+ based on fundamentals alone. But I expect these numbers to skyrocket as they gain more members and their AI learning database improves more and more.\n\n[CLOV Medicare Advantage Plan by &#37; of growth compared to competitors \\(cloverhealth.com\\)](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/wuoalim07q371.png?width=3297&format=png&auto=webp&s=b38cba4adeb4fcbbeae5d53ea93751964480113a)\n\nCLOV has huge long-term growth potential, so the risk to reward is extremely favorable towards getting into the squeeze. Let me explain why.\n\n**Positive Catalysts**\n\nAll the negative catalysts are out of the way and everything is priced in. Here are some positives I\u2019m keeping an eye on: \n\n* DOJ\/SEC case dropping or settling (even if CLOV is found guilty of taking advantage of Medicare, it will still be positive because at max they\u2019ll pay a fine and that\u2019ll be over with). I highly doubt CLOV will be found guilty though because the Hindenburg claims are rather baseless and the DOJ were forced to inquire about this only because it\u2019s related to Medicare. \n* Biden\u2019s health care proposal reducing the Medicare qualifying age below 65 would create millions of new beneficiaries. The hype around the proposal alone will create a huge stock price increase in all healthcare-related stocks, so CLOV will definitely benefit.\n* CLOV is officially added to the Russell 3000, who will have to purchase a ton of CLOV shares.\n* PR of any new partnership, expanding to further states, and increasing current partnerships. They\u2019re growing rapidly as is, so news like this is bound to come out in the near future.\n\n**The Dark Clouds Surrounding CLOV**\n\n* As previously mentioned, the DOJ inquiry is still lingering and it\u2019s unclear when it will be settled. Although it\u2019s priced in, it is still something to watch out for.\n* Hindenturd\u2019s constant attacks despite insisting they don\u2019t have any positions. Why would Hindenburg attack Chamath Palihapitiya even though they aren\u2019t benefiting from it, according to themselves? This relates to the GME\/AMC squeeze; Chamath was a big proponent of the push against the hedges. He was outspoken about the squeeze on several occasions and gave GME his validation, which in turn hurt Citadel and other hedges shorting GME immensely. Hindenburg\u2019s report was created to hurt all of Chamath\u2019s IPOs, especially CLOV. Basically, this is retaliation against Chamath for standing with the retail investors, and if I had to take a wild guess, Citadel has paid Hindenburg to write this baseless report. I\u2019ve added a link at the bottom of this post about the Hindenburg allegations and the counter from CLOV for those who were not aware of all the allegations. (PS - Despite all the negative press surrounding Chamath, his track record is stellar.)\n* The constant manipulation by short sellers to create negative incentive. For instance, the fake lawsuits by Lifshitz that are shady at best; if you go to their website, you\u2019ll find the phone number listed goes straight to voicemail. All their social media lead to Wix.com platforms instead of their own. And, **THEIR PHYSICAL LOCATION DOES NOT EXIST** as shown in Google Maps. Lots of red flags.\n\n**Let\u2019s get down to the nitty gritty - The Daddy of all Short Squeezes**\n\nCLOV is currently over 42.58% as of Friday, making it the highest shorted stock on paper (and it\u2019s unclear how many naked shorts there are, which could easily be 70-100%+; it\u2019s impossible to know since those shares are shorted illegally). THE SQUEEZE IS INEVITABLE, it\u2019s just a matter of how much more the short interest increases, which will correlate to a bigger squeeze. Furthermore, the borrowed interest on CLOV stock has more than doubled to 3.7%, meaning those who are shorting have to pay much higher interest on borrowing the stocks, and that number will only continue to increase as demand increases. Soon, they won\u2019t be able to borrow anymore stocks and will have to short it naked in order to suppress the price further, essentially digging a gargantuan hole in which to bury themselves.\n\n[CLOV S\\\/I&#37; as reported by Ortex](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/yem0laz57q371.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d0602994d6bc0ddc1305c2737a8b1d70de3f7c58)\n\nNo need to fear the company dumping their shares or diluting it because the Class B shares are locked up - the directors aren\u2019t able to sell any shares until the stock price stays above $30 for 90 consecutive days or more. The company is $700 million cash flow positive and no debt, therefore there won\u2019t be any dilution.\n\nThe P\/S ratio is considered a particularly good metric for evaluating young, potentially high growth companies or companies in cyclical industries that may not show an actual net profit every year. Let\u2019s talk about CLOV\u2019s P\/S ratio for a moment. \n\nCLOV\u2019s 2020 revenue was $672.9 million compared to $462.3 million in 2019, which puts it at 45.6% increase in growth. They beat their own expectations and those of analysts by a wide margin. In 2018 and 2019, the market valued tech companies with IPOs at an average of 11.7 and 10.4 times (respectively) their previous 12 month earnings. Conservatively, that would put CLOV at $7 billion market cap, which is around $20+ fair value. But in 2020, that number doubled, which would increase CLOV\u2019s market cap significantly. However, for this consideration, I\u2019m using the 2018\/19 valuation to be conservative.\n\n**Bottom Line**\n\nThe fair value of CLOV is anywhere from $20-30 fundamentally, which makes it a very risk-free, undervalued stock that has been suppressed by short sellers. But this post is not about the fundamentals - this is about exposing the short sellers\u2019 manipulation of CLOV. On paper, this company is shorted 42.58% (though this is MUCH higher when you include the illegal naked shorts that aren\u2019t reported), making it the highest shorted stock as of Friday. This number could go much higher as short sellers continue to borrow stocks and suppress the price further, which only hurts them more the longer this is shorted. As is common knowledge from previous squeezes, hedge funds are not going to cover anytime soon; they have to be forced by triggering their margins. As the Fed hinted recently, hedge funds are the most leveraged they\u2019ve ever been in the last 20 years, which means retail investors can take advantage of them just like they\u2019ve been taking advantage of retail investors for 100s of years.\n\nI don\u2019t know how much it could squeeze, from $50-150 or much higher, and there\u2019s no telling where the ceiling will end up. The squeeze is inevitable, whether you or I buy it or not, but the process of how long it will take is up to the retail investing community.\n\nCLOV\u2019s Response to Hindenburg Allegations: [https:\/\/www.streetinsider.com\/Corporate+News\/Clover+Health+Investments+%28CLOV%29+Issues+Response+to+Short+Seller+Hindenburg+Research\/17921324.html](https:\/\/www.streetinsider.com\/Corporate+News\/Clover+Health+Investments+%28CLOV%29+Issues+Response+to+Short+Seller+Hindenburg+Research\/17921324.html)","200":"AMC Outperforming other stocks in terms of short seller pain FYI, AMC has had the most painful to short sellers since GME.

I wouldn't make this if I didn't believe in $CLNE. I like the stock, and I think it's \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf1d.

You can see this start around April 19 when the Amazon deal settled and a Raymond James Wannabe-analyst changed his rating to underperform and subsequently sent the price down to further his own dying career. The deal involves a warrant, allowing AMZN to buy CLNE stock at $13.49\/share which should have raised the price floor. Short interest is actually low now, around 7% (correct me if I'm wrong) , but the stock is worth at least TWICE what it currently is. Low volume has kept this stock down, just look at the daily chart and see how only a few thousand shares in under an hour can move the price of this stock.\n\n[The small spike notes a recent influx of newly purchased shares as a result of attention from a recent DD by u\\\/BlackDiamondBear.

While this play could bring you THOUSANDS of tendies upon lift off, you're investing in a company that supplies clean fuel (Renewable natural gas, RNG) to companies like Amazon that require constant fueling for their trucks. Electric Vehicles just haven't reached the capacity to power long haul fleets, but RNG can. Amazon realizes this and has already signed a deal with CLNE to use 8% of its stations, validating their business. They expect CLNE to be worth much more than $13.49 in the future, otherwise they wouldn't have signed the deal. While calls are great and can make you money quick, you're hopping on a rocket that's trying to fuel for lift off. SHARES are the play.\n\nNow if we take into consideration the amount of shares that will come into play if the $13 threshold is passed, that's 1.862 Million shares, not including the calls at other strike prices above and below.

Also, imagine if DFV owned enough shares to own GME. Well our very own Papa Chad Dickens nearly owns 5% of the company. He could buy em out if he really felt like it. We're talking WSB buying out an energy sector company. Imagine the headlines on that. This stonk's already moved like 30 cents in the past couple hours with only a tad bit of support.

I have noticed a pattern emerge with the current AMC trading and GME the first time.\n\nIt appears there a few day gradual buildup leading to a big upshot. On the upshot day there are halts and restarts. The following day for GME was huge as well and it continues now to slowly climb from a big dip.\n\nI am Interested in hearing Apes talk on any reason this current halt, dip, halt moment with AMC will not then moonshot like what we saw with GME the first time.","208":"Calls on L Brands ($LB)? For those who don't know, $LB is the parent company of brands like Bath and Body Works and Victoria's Secret, which they are reportedly spinning off soon. \n\nOn 1\/27\/21, during the original GME squeeze, LB tanked roughly 15%, as Melvin Capital reportedly owned a large stake in the company and had their short bets against GME destroyed. There was likely a combination of Melvin having to sell shares to pay back their shorts, and retail and algos piling on to short LB after realizing this.\n\nNow, with AMC up 100% today, LB is down over 5% at the time of this post. Is this a coincidence, or are traders shorting stocks that performed poorly during the last huge meme stock rally?\n\n I'm thinking about going in for a couple contracts on LB off of this hunch. There is no other company-specific news to justify this move, and everything I've read on them has been fairly bullish.\n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts on this one.","209":"Why AMC is rallying and why it will CONTINUE rallying \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf11 You guys need some re-assurance or a reason to buy more AMC? Here's some dd. Last week and today AMC has had a very good rally, but this is just the beginning, now let me tell you why. (I know finance can be dense and complicated so i'll try to keep it simple)\n\n# TLDR\n\n\\- There's a lot of options between 30 and 40 being placed which causes market makers to buy more shares causing a Gamma Squeeze today and after hours. If more large option volume is placed tomorrow between 40-50 the Gamma Squeeze will keep going, continuing so on and so forth.\n\n\\- Short holders will lose a lot of money as share price continues up, forcing them to buy more AMC to close their position sometime through the week.\n\n\\- \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf11\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf11\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf11\n\n# DD\n\nThe past few weeks have been great for meme stocks, but AMC is leading at the frontline of this rally outperforming the others like GME, BB, etc, boasting a 112% increase the past week. One of the reasons i've been able to hold confidence in, is AMC's option volume. A call is a contract to sell you 100 shares of a stock at a certain price. Behind this contract, are people called Market Makers. These are people sitting at investment banks and financial institutions, writing contracts for people to buy options if there is a lack of supply. Now let's look at the option chain for today expiring next week\n\n[Weekly call options from yahoo finance](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/4k96sf790s271.jpg?width=1327&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6bf3ccff9fc9a91c18dbf10af372fa488a89b5fd)\n\nIf we look at the 2nd column from the right, that's the current volume of call options. Whenever people buy options, in order for market makers to minimize as much risk as possible, they buy stock in order to stay \"delta neutral\". Fancy phrase I know. A very basic explanation is that no matter where the stock moves, the market makers don't lose money. Their goal isn't to bet against you, their goal is to scalp the bid\/ask margins. Now notice how the option volume is particularly high at 30, 35, and 40. As the price moves closer to these strike prices, market makers got to buy more shares in order to stay delta neutral. Now with this high volume, market makers need to buy **A LOT** more shares everytime the price goes up, which then snowballs larger and larger causing something called a \"Gamma squeeze\", which basically means STONK GO UP. Last week a similar phenomenon occured, now we can see it will especially rally up at the 30 (which it did), 35(which it did), and 40 mark (soon to come). Once we get closer to 40 hopefully tomorrow there will be more options being placed in order for the Gamma squeeze to continue, but until then we have the next phase.... the famous.... short squeeze...\n\nGamma squeeze is caused by an incrementation of options being placed which causes market makers to buy more shares to minimize their risk. Now that we've hit this point, the price has gone up a lot. Today alone AMC went up 40%. And. that. is. big. oh. no. to. short holders. Short holders are **borrowing** AMC shares in hopes AMC will go down so they can buy back the share at a cheaper price, luckily for us, these guys have not learnt their lesson! With AMC mooning from the Gamma squeezes, short holders will be hard red and and are **forced** to close out of their short position, requiring them to buy AMC driving the price up even further! This is what brought GME to it's peak of 400$\/share. If we look at the short interest a month ago.\n\n[Short interest a month ago from Ortex](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/yc81t36v0s271.png?width=1772&format=png&auto=webp&s=a80da820a287bc54ef2b20a905effe62f60bae4a)\n\nWe can see here AMC was 20% shorted. Through the month short holders continued to close more and more causing AMC to go up and up. This drove the value higher and higher, and now AMC is busting 38$\/share. Now notice that cute little tick at the bottom.\n\n[Short interest 2 weeks ago from Ortex](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/a8xq2ws71s271.png?width=1220&format=png&auto=webp&s=535e4ba376352ffc0e6f86ae37434372ce204faf)\n\nWe can see here AMC short interest dropped to 16% but it looks like these short holders are doubling down and are increasing their short position. Today alone we busted 40% increase in AMC, if we can keep going we can make short holders force to close and climb even higher heights. 16-20% doesn't seem like much, but doing the math....\n\nTotal shares in circulation = 448m ([taken from yahoo finance](https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/quote\/AMC\/key-statistics\/))\n\nFloat % = 18% (paid ortex subscription as shown above)\n\nShares shorted = 80.6million\n\n80.6 \\* 37$ (current AMC share value at the time of writing) = $2.983b\n\n.... needed to buy AMC. And that's before the AMC rocket takes off, it'll be even more while the rocket flies. So if any of you need any extra re-assurance, or a reason to put more money in, here ya go. If you guys want to continue the Gamma Squeeze, keep in mind the price needs momentum to carry up. Don't buy ridiculously far out call options like 70s or 80s because that won't give the stock an opportunity to climb up the 40s-60s range. It needs to be an incremental climb.\n\nThis is not financial advice, do your own research, and if you got any corrections for me please let me know! I'll edit my post or remove it completely if i missed\/did something wrong\n\n# Reversal\n\nI'd be bs'ing you if i didn't say that this could go horribly wrong. The narrative i explained isn't **guaranteed to work**. In the case of bad news, or a large sell off, this can cause the price to fall or halt. Then the Gamma squeeze can't be sqoze which will then prevent the Short squeeze. Another point to keep in mind is **we don't know exactly when the short holders will cover**. They can double down and wait us out, but if we can keep the Gamma squeeze going, they'll have to close. To hold shorts you must pay a premium of [10%](https:\/\/iborrowdesk.com\/report\/AMC) every year. This fee can increase though, and it has been steadily increasing as the price continues to go up.\n\nThis is not financial advice. Please do your own research and please... don't bet more than you can lose in case of these events. As for me, i'm waking up at market open tomorrow and yolo'ing the rest of my 10k into more call options before the rocket blasts.  \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf11\ud83c\udf11\ud83c\udf11\n\n# Exit\n\nI dont' want people to bag hold in case this thing pops like a lot of people did during GME. My plan to exit is to monitor when the volume on the option chain starts becoming low. You can check the [option volume here](https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/quote\/AMC\/options?p=AMC). Once the option volume becomes thin, there's not enough potential for a gamma squeeze. If the short interest becomes low, there's no chance for a short squeeze. If any of these happens, that's when i plan to stop buying weekly calls and sell my shares. Or if robinhood decides to ban AMC trading again....\n\n# Update\n\nIts happening, we goin to the moon bois! \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf11\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf11\n\nNow that we've hit in the money for all strikes (it just hit 70), short squeeze **probably** sqoze (this doesn't mean all shorts covered, just the immediate ones such as hedge funds that are too far in the red or can't afford the premiums) I exited all my call options and taking profits. To those who are undoubtedly gonna say something about being paper handed, it's a good idea to constantly take profits and protect yourself. DFV took profits periodically himself. Take care of yourself and don't get too greedy. With that being said I still have a few hundred shares in AMC and gonna wait for another opportunity to play more options again. Congrats to everyone that followed and profitted!!!","210":"A forecasted potential earnings Breakdown for AMC, BB, & ASO \ud83d\ude0e from one dork to a bunch of retards First things first, I hope you all understand that math is scientific, and these numbers will be pretty accurate but with all things finance sometimes assumptions must be made. The assumption being made here is that the stock market will react to AMC, BB, and ASO short squeezes EXACTLY as it did to GME. A true apples to apples comparison of what has happened to GME being applied to our other favorites.\n\nUp first is teaching you how to calculate earning in the form of a percentage. The formula goes like this. (Current Value - initial Cost)\u00f7initial cost x 100= percentage return. \n\nGmE started at roughly 18$ before it gained squeeze worthy traction and eventually topped out at $483. I chose 18$ as the starting point t because earning up until that point were smooth and slowly trending upwards on a 1 year chart. GmE has 70 Million Shares outstanding. It's 18 to 483 dollars increase gives it a return of 2,583% roughly.\n\nApplying this to AMC goes like this. AMC had a \"pre-surge\" stable price of 10$. 10x25.83=258$ however GME only has 15 percent of the shares outstanding that AMC has so you have to consider the market Cap. $258x.15%= $38.70 expected squeeze price. All variables being the same at its highest AMC could go to $38.70 \n\nBB is going  to be very similar to AMC because of a large market cap. BB \"pre-surge\" stable price is $10 as well, this is being generous because a good argument could be made to use $8-9 but I decided to use 10. So 10x25.83=$258 however GME only has 12% of shares outstanding as BB so that has to be factored in 258x .12%= $30.96  I believe at the height of any BB squeeze due to market cap the price could soar as high as $30 using GME variables.\n\nHere is where things get interesting ASO has a \"pre-surge\" stable price of $30 and GME has 77% of shares outstanding compared to ASO, a Much higher variable, with a much higher starting price, and a higher short interest than BB & AMC. Here we go 30x25.83= 775$ \n775 x.77= $596 squeeze price potential\n\nSo in essence we can triple our money or better on AMC & BB depending on when you bought in. AsO has the potential to be HUUUGGE\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\ude03","211":"What is DTC and why you still shouldn't care I often see people in the daily thread leaving lazy comments about, \"Ticker X has short interest of Y%\". This is dumb, and you should feed bad about wasting our time with something so useless.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# What is short interest\n\nHere we find the first reason why this is dumb comment. Short interest is an incredibly vague concept. Usually you see it reckoned as a percentage of the float, or the shares outstanding, but even this is not a consistent definition. Thinking back to the GME runup there were two numbers being thrown around for Short Interest, 140% and 270%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe first number (140%) was short interest divided by the \\*total shares outstanding\\*. If a company has 1000 shares outstanding and 200 shares have been short sold, this works out to a 20% short ratio. But not every outstanding share is available to trade on any given day. Many will be owned by the company itself, insiders, and institutions that are not legally allowed to sell them without doing a bunch of publicly available (priced in) paperwork. So sometimes you'll see numbers like the second (270%) which use the shares that are available to trade on any given day as the denominator. If only 700 shares are available to the market that will increase the short float to almost 30%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTrouble is, how do you define a share that is available to trade? If you don't know the definition that was used when calculating the number you're throwing around, then you don't know what the short float number \\*actually means\\*. And if you don't know or can't explain it then you shouldn't be wasting our time with it because its meaningless.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# What is Days to Cover\n\nThere is *another* way of reckoning short interest that actually does have some validity. **Days to Cover** is a measure of how many days of trading it would take for every short position to be unwound. This is the total number of shares shorted divided by the average trading volume. That ratio is the number of days *on average* it would take for shorts to cover. If every short position had to be closed as quickly as possible it would take that many days *if every share traded were used to close a short position* for short interest by any metric to reach zero. This is at least a little bit useful because you can tell how long an increase in buying pressure from short positions being closed is likely to last.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Why even DTC is not particularly useful\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven DTC can be an inconsistent metric, though, as likely not every short position must be closed immediately (reducing DTC) and the fact that it is taking the *average* volume means that a single high volume day could easily drop that number substantially. You don't know what's going to happen just because you have access to a single metric which is also available to every other trader on the market -and that includes those with open shorts. Going back to the GME example, even at the height of the short squeeze craze DTC was sitting at just over six days. Six days of *average* volume to cover and we saw trade volumes that were an order of magnitude higher than that average. Does that mean the shorts covered? Who knows. You certainly don't, even if someone on the internet told you they didn't.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# It's probably not a short squeeze\n\nWhile the concept of a short squeeze is valid, you need to understand that they are incredibly rare events. If you want to make trading them your primary strategy, have fun, but be ready to wait a **long** time (*years*) for the next opportunity. You don't know when short positions need to be unwound, and there's no way for you to force anyone to do it involuntarily. You can be sure that they are doing everything in their power to minimize their losses\/maximize their profits and you should do the same. Why should we believe that a ticker that is 30% short with a DTC < 1 is going to squeeze? If you can't explain that, then it's not worth crowing about. *Nobody cares about your half-thought out conspiracy theory.* DFV spent a *year* building his case and still came within a few months of his positions expiring worthless. Michael Burry almost went bankrupt waiting for the housing market to crash. *You don't hear the stories of the ones who lost it all, even if they were right on the premise*.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you've got knowledge of squeeze that is incoming, great, but build a case for it. Wildly screaming, \"GME SHORT INTEREST 30%\" in the daily is not a case. Shouting \"GME DTC 1.4 DAYS\" is a little more informative, but ultimately meaningless without further context. Can they afford to spread the covering out over several days? A week? *Four fucking months?* How many are held by a single entity, and therefore likely to be closed all at once? What is the price doing? Why would they get squeezed if the position is profitable and looks to continue being profitable for the foreseeable future? If you don't know, then nobody is going to care.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# No Bullshitting\n\nWe have a rule here: \"No Bullshitting\". \"Don't make shit up, and be responsible giving and taking advice. This includes talking about things you don't know about. You should listen, not talk. Nobody wants an ill-informed opinion. Lurk More.\" *Nobody wants an ill-informed opinion*. **Nobody wants an ill-informed opinion**. If you're in the daily thread vomiting numbers that are effectively meaningless in an attempt to pu&#xFEFF;mp your pet stock, expect to be (at best) ignored. I know you're excited, and this may be your first foray into the market. Welcome. Lurk more.","212":"BYND The case for BYND\n\nImproving fundamentals: It just received a double upgrade and now has two consecutive analyst upgrades. The total addressable market for BYND is potentially in the trillions of dollars: displacing animal-based beef, pork, eggs, cheese, and chicken. The World Economic Forum has argued that global meat consumption must fall within the coming years. According to Forbes, 60% of Gen Z is looking to base their diets on \u201cplant-forward\u201d foods. \n\nBYND market cap\u2019s only $10 billion. It\u2019s growing like a weed. Yearly revenue growth for the past three is 131% compounded annually.  \n\nAnd BYND might have a durable competitive advantage. According to analyst Alexia Howard, for BYND, \u201cas plant-based products tend to be relatively complex to manufacture, moats could prove to be deep.\u201d Additionally, as of 2019, the company had one patent and 21 U.S. and international patent applications.  \n\nIt\u2019s attempting to achieve price parity with animal-based meat in the next few years and ultimately even produce for cheaper. As the first-mover, it also has the potential to achieve economies of scale faster and become most attractive from a price standpoint. Its competitor Impossible Burger has had to turn down partnerships because it hasn\u2019t had the infrastructure that BYND has and couldn\u2019t produce sufficient product to service big partnerships. BYND\u2019s further along and has been able to garner partnerships with the likes of KFC, McDonald\u2019s, Starbucks, Pepsi, Pizza Hut. Impossible Burger also produces its food with GMOs, which are outlawed in many countries. BYND already sells products in 80 countries.  \n\nRemember that the GME run started in 2020 with not only high short interest but attractiveness from a fundamental perspective that led big investors like Michael Burry and Ryan Cohen to move in aggressively. BYND has this fundamental attractiveness more than a lot of companies with a high short interest, which analysts are largely downrating.  \n\nBYND\u2019s growth took more of a pandemic-related hit than other food providers because much of its growth involves people buying their products in restaurants. It is, therefore, considered a re-opening play. \n\nBYND spends 7% of revenue on R&D, which is many times that of more mature food providers, so the future looks bright. \n\nHigh short interest: According to both MarketWatch and Ortex, BYND\u2019s short interest is higher than AMC, BB, and GME. \n\nFavorable externalities: Good against global warming, good for animals, good for global resources, good for human health. This gives incentives to many influentials (celebrities, governments) to encourage people to consume plant-based meat. Governments have subsidized the electric vehicle industry. Will they do the same for clean meat?  \n\nCramer has suggested BYND as a WSB play to his 250,000 viewers during each of his last three Mad Money episodes (Tues, Weds, Thurs; no show Fri) and elsewhere on CNBC. A couple people here have suggested Cramer has done so as a distraction. I understand the bitterness toward hedge funds: They\u2019re selling out, making a lot of money while not adding much to society. But Cramer\u2019s offering insight to nonprofessional investors to help them make investing decisions. I just started watching Cramer again about a month ago and just about everything he\u2019s liked most has moved up in value: Roblox, Ford, Wells Fargo. He has, in the past, consistently said favorable things about BYND and Ethan Brown. He\u2019s even suggested in the past that going against BYND is going against history. \n\nAnd anyway, the proof is in the pudding: BYND short interest is higher than AMC, BB, and GME, according to MarketWatch and Ortex. And it would be a lot nicer for a company displacing animal meat to sell stock and get more capital for R&D than a cell phone or a movie theater company. \n\nI was following the market in 2013, and this situation reminds me so much of Tesla in May 2013. The stock started rising on fundamentals, and commentators thought it was highly priced and thought it was rising only due to a short squeeze. But electric vehicles were the future and Tesla kept rising for years, even though there was concern that big players would get into the industry. Beyond Meat is also the future and has the potential to rise even after the short squeeze, which is one reason institutional investors may be buying. BYND\u2019s market cap of about $10 billion is also the same as Tesla\u2019s when its run started in 2013 and commentators were scoffing at its valuation. Now it\u2019s over $600 billion. \n\nThis stock right now is potentially set up for a  strong run within the next few months: increasing bullishness of institutional investors, high short interest, and maybe the increasing support of WSB. It\u2019s 40% below its all-time high. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it doubles in the next several months.  \n\nDisclaimer: I\u2019m not in any other squeeze plays. I will probably write covered calls on AMC and hedge with puts because their short-term calls are very highly priced. (This is a delta-neutral position that should not impact AMC share price.) I have BYND calls and may buy more because their short-term calls are still cheap.","213":"Made another WSB sentiment analyzing bot (I used machine learning) -- 33% annual return ($16k). Source code and explanation below! So a few days ago someone made a sentiment analyzing bot for this sub and as a programmer myself, I thought I\u2019d try my hand! For those of you that want to poke around or use this for yourself, \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: here\u2019s my [source code](https:\/\/github.com\/tstewart161\/Reddit_Sentiment_Trader)\n\nEdit: [Hosted version](https:\/\/getquantbase.com\/) (how to actually run\/invest in it). Folks the amount of y\u2019all that have messaged me asking for this is absolutely AMAZING but I can\u2019t keep up! Posting the link here for you guys\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**HOW I DID THIS:** Scraped WSB sentiment, got the top + most positively mentioned stocks on WSB (for the better part of this year, that's been $GME and $AMC, recently some $SPCE and $NVDA, and about 6 other stocks -- I could do more but the relevance drops off typically after this. I have the strategy rebalancing monthly. The source code is actually pretty intuitive for a beginner\/intermediate programmer, but essentially what it uses is VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning), which is a model used for text sentiment analysis that is sensitive to both polarity (positive\/negative) and intensity (strength) of emotion.\n\n**HOW THIS WORKS:** The way it works is by relying on a dictionary that maps lexical (aka word-based) features to emotion intensities -- these are known as sentiment scores. The overall sentiment score of a comment\/post is achieved by summing up the intensity of each word in the text.\n\nIn some ways, it's easy: words like \u2018love\u2019, \u2018enjoy\u2019, \u2018happy\u2019, \u2018like\u2019 all convey a positive sentiment. Also VADER is smart enough to understand the basic context of these words, such as \u201cdid not love\u201d as a negative statement.

Banks reveal they don't have enough physical holdings -> indicates shortage \n2. Banks can't short physical commodities like gold and silver beyond their physical holdings -> banks cover their shorts causing a squeeze. Banks manipulating the silver market is not a conspiracy theory spread during the gme squeeze to distract wsb retards from gme. The manipulation has been going on for a long time and big banks have been fined heavily for manipulating the silver market ([https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/jp-morgan-spoofing-penalty-idUSKBN26K325](https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/jp-morgan-spoofing-penalty-idUSKBN26K325))\n\nJP Morgan has been a big culprit of manipulating the precious metals market by suppressing the price through paper shorts and when the price falls they buy physical bars of silver.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRecall that the basel three regulations take place on june 28. Take a look at the OI for $SPY\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[OI for $SPY](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/yxbdwumzr3271.jpg?width=652&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ef7a95c937dfdcf0cc136a95c09205a46ddb6c64)\n\nLook at the 06\/30 oi. There's an unusually high oi for 06\/30 which is a weekly expiry whereas all the other weeklys are nowhere close to the oi on 06\/30. There's a 74% oi for put and 25% oi for call on that expiry and similar ratios for the expiries close to june 28 when the basel 3 regulations take effect.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow look at the oi for $SLV\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[OI for $SLV](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/on521lejs3271.png?width=1232&format=png&auto=webp&s=7fb65ae75d160e8df27682d7a24ddeb82a946d36)\n\nAgain look at the 06\/30 expiry with the unusally high oi. 1.1 million oi on 06\/30 which is INSANELY HIGH for any expiry let alone a weekly. And at this expiry the call oi is 80% and the put oi is 19% which is the opposite of what was observed with SPY. \n\nNow, normal wsb retards have no idea of basel 3 and the effects on the precious metals market. The high oi and call oi on june 30 on $SLV can't be attributed to wsb retards who hate silver. It's most likely the smart money coming into play. \n\nSpy has a high put\/call ratio while silver has a high call\/put ratio on that expiry. Similar values on QQQ and GLD respectively. This points to a scenario where silver moons and spy drills.\n\nTake note that june 28 has a lot of other regulations coming into place as well and there can be other huge moves in the market in other sectors due to the different regulations.\n\nA lot of wsb thought the silver squeeze movement was a conspiracy by the banks but look up the data by yourself if you aren't convinced by this dd.","215":"Genuine AMC question (related to any short squeeze) So this is something I can't figure out and I'd really appreciate it if someone helped me understand.\n\nEveryone is talking about how the squeeze didn't even happen and the shorts didn't cover yet. What I don't understand is why wouldn't that be possible? If short interest is 17%, so let's round up to about 100M shares. Today the volume traded was 700M shares. Couldn't 100M of those 700M have been the shorts covering? And if they didn't cover, today alone 700M shares were traded, why would 100M shares bought by shorts cause a squeeze if today 700M were traded?\n\nI have been having this question for awhile, since I noticed the same with GME. In the days preceding January 28th (when GME reached its peak), the combined volume was several times the amount of float. How come the squeeze happened and why did it happen? If the volume was so high, couldn't the shorts have covered in the days preceding that?\n\nI hope this makes sense and I really hope someone will be kind enough to explain a fellow retard who only knows about crayons what this all means.\n\nP.s.

As you can see above, the ratio follows very close to that of inflation. It then slows late 2019. This can probably be blamed on the Fed saying they were wrong, according to the Guardian. From here, it only gets worse. Covid dropped numbers significantly (No surprise), but the ratio is yet to recover.

Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor this is not advice don't listen to me etc.\n\nBefore the content let me say I'm not going to talk about the [fundamentals of this company](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/MillennialBets\/comments\/n0414o\/uwmc_a_fundamental_analysis_of_why_this_stock_is\/) today (they're great), [the value even with no short-term price movement](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/nd9hyr\/uwm_holdings_looks_like_a_value_bargain_with_low\/), [a super good dividend](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dividends\/comments\/ndc6pu\/united_wholesale_mortgage_uwmc_is_the_most\/), [the wild housing market](https:\/\/the1a.org\/segments\/housing-pandemic-market\/), [the great strategic decisions the company has made](https:\/\/twitter.com\/SleipnirPerkins\/status\/1378305915800186884), or anything other than strictly the stock. I like the company, but I love the stock.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Low float, low volume**\n\nUWM has 1.6 billion total shares, but 1.5 billion of them are owned by the CEO and not traded. The Class A shares outstanding are 103million, with \\~13million owned by insiders. That's a 90 million public float, with another 25.5million in institutional ownership. Institutions can sell, of course, but a lot of this ownership is large conservative firms that aren't day trading this stock. (Pension funds, Vanguard, etc.). I would estimate the actual \"active\" float at less than 70 million.\n\nAverage daily volume is very low - volume Friday was 4 million, and there have been recent days with volume south of 2 million. The last time volume was more than 20 million was the first week of March, and look what happened to the stock. (Spoiler: it ran up to 12.50) If this stock gets real sustained volume, it can and will fly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Short interest, high short volume**\n\nIn the post-GME world we just aren't going to see short interests over 100% anymore - the highest on the market right now is 40-50% in Pubmatic and Root. But the shorts aren't gone, they're just more sneaky. The official Short interest over the last two months has been in the moderate zone, a bit below 20% of the active float. \n\nShort interest through May 15 won't be available until the 25th, but short volume has spiked since RKT's disappointing earnings took the stock down to ATLs. In fact over 50% of the volume on 6 of the last 7 trading days was short sales. ([Source](http:\/\/shortvolumes.com\/?t=uwmc)) The shorts are here and they are relentless.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Short Fee Spike, low short shares available, failure to settle**\n\nLast Monday, there were up to 400,000 short shares available with about 3% interest. **Right now the short fees are around (or over) 100% with almost zero shares available to short.** ([Source](https:\/\/iborrowdesk.com\/report\/uwmc)) It's [over 300%](https:\/\/charts.stocktwits.com\/production\/original_330645419.jpg) on Ortex. This is the same pattern that was seen in AMC last week, RKT in March, and other stocks that have had rapid runs.\n\nRegarding naked shorting and FTS - It's happening, and it's significant. UWMC has been on the threshold securities list for 12 straight trading days. I'll [let the recent post on this](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/ncczh8\/uwmc_on_nyse_threshold_securities_list_regulation\/) speak for itself and not explain this again except to say the official FTS data is only available with a 1-month lag so recent hard numbers aren't available.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Huge Buyback**\n\nMonday during earnings, UWM announced they will be buying back **$300 million** **in stock** over the next 2 years, starting this week. At the Friday closing price of 7.51, that's about 42.5 million shares, or **half of the active float** of the stock. Disclaimers: 1) they can only use about half the money (21 million shares) before the public shares become too low to be considered in the Russell 1000, which the CEO has said he wants next month. 2) They have 2 years to spend the money. But, they have every incentive to strike quickly due to the cheap stock price (and the CEO has said as much). 3) There are legal limits on daily buybacks equal to 25% of the average daily volume of the stock - 7M right now, so a limit of 1.75M shares per day. That's still a huge, huge potential amount though.\n\nWhat does this mean, in effect? Besides the obvious buy pressure and lowering of outstanding shares, **incredible uncertainty and risk for anyone now shorting the stock.** It's tough to go heavily short when a million-share buy order could be coming in at any time. \n\nThere's no way to know when buybacks are happening, but  there was a suspiciously big buy on Wednesday afternoon at about 1:45pm. Based on this and [public statements from the CEO](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/nclll1\/uwmc_the_most_important_statement_for_all_shares\/), It's safe to say that the buybacks are actually happening now and not theoretical.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Options - Would you look at that**\n\nThis is where it get juicy. The options interest on this stock is massive, especially on next week's 5\/21 expiry. **Between the $7.5 and $15 strikes, there are 205,500 open call contracts expiring next Friday. That's 20.5 million shares if they are all exercised. Most importantly,** the average delta of these options is currently about 0.1 **-** meaning the big Market Makers are only 10% covered on the shares**.** The 9, 10, and 12.50 strikes each by themselves all have open interest near to or greater than the entire daily volume of the stock on most days! \n\nAs for puts, above 7.5, there are almost no (<5000) open puts expiring.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion -** What needs to happen\n\nFirst, this needs to sustain above $7.5. The stock spent most of the day last Friday banging against a 300k share Ask wall at $7.5, and finally broke it at close (and climbed AH!). This was huge and encouraging, but I am 100% sure the shorts and option MMs will be back to try to pin it at 7.5 all week long. (Tangent: go look at what happened on April 16, the last options expiry date. it closed at 7.49 on the dot, wiping out everyone's options on both sides.)\n\nSecond this needs to get to, and through, $9. Once the price approaches and breaks $9, Delta is going to force the MMs to buy shares to cover their contracts. And once the price momentum breaks to the rapid upside through the $9, $10, $11, and $12.5 strikes, there are 12 million short shares that will need covering. \n\nIt's not quite a pure gamma squeeze, and it's not a pure short squeeze, but there's elements of both here and it's all converging this week.\n\n**TL;DR:** This stock has a low active float, a whole bunch of shorts, and a huge amount of unhedged calls expiring on Friday. All in the midst of a gigantic share buyback.  The conditions are perfect for a huge run.","221":"$DASH - Even your wife's boyfriend haters Dashing Doordash is a food delivery company that IPO'd last December at a $37 BILLION market cap.

Highest revenue quarter ever, yet still lost money. \n\nMay 14 (today) - Rallies up to 25% intra-day, sitting at $142 as I write this. One of the biggest pops of today, according to finviz. \n\n\nWhy this garbage is primed to burn past today's rally - \n\n- Economy is going to open and inflation is coming. CPI report with the newest high since '08 and highest monthly jump pattern since 1960 or some shit, when your grandaddys were eating crayons to set the tone for his successors (you). That means less dashers and more people actually living life in the summer in the U S of A first time since the pandemic. \n\n- Had a breakout year where revenues more than 3x'd and still didn't make any money like GME bag holders, same with yesterday's earnings report for Q1 - still didn't make any freaking profits.\n\n- Ongoing upheaval with legislative forces regarding the classification of its' employees as actual employees instead of \"gig workers\" who take it up the ass with no benefits and stability. Will have to pull money out the ass to pay up when push comes to shove. https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/uber-uk-drivers-workers-not-employees\/\n\n- Rallied 20%-25% TODAY after the revenue beat on earnings - still missed EPS (and lost money ofc), but some aNaLySt UpGrAdEs followed since last night - Wells Fargo to overweight, and Youssef Squali from Truist Securities upgraded to Buy at $185. You can look at his most recent price targets. https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/NUPuFry.png (LOL) hint: I stopped reading at BABA 290.\n\nAnd last but NOT LEAST...\n\n- Doordash's FINAL lock-up expiry is coming in just about 3 weeks from now, here's the SEC filing https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1792789\/000119312520292381\/d752207ds1.htm\n\nhere's the relevant photo showing the exact date, since December 9 - https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/TCicUGK.png\n\nThis is Doordash's FINAL lock-up expiry on June 8, which basically has no restrictions around Rule 144 (things that exist to not plummet the stock). All the stocks that have been restricted and\/or privately held, barring very unique and special conditions, will be let loose into the secondary\/retail market, where us retards have been privileged to gobble up at a 40% premium to the initial IPO. Given current numbers, Dash is expecting to increase their current public float of ~150 million shares, to the ENTIRETY of ~300 million shares outstanding, with some extra ~30 million bound to underwriters or something. The float is about to increase at minimum 25%, at most, about 50%. To say the least, you can expect some profit taking for this garbage stock which, while it may survive, turns no profits at temporary record-breaking numbers aided by the worst pandemic in history during which had TRIPLED its' revenue.\n\npositions: https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/T73C5UY.png May 28 135 puts, I would buy more but I'm short on buying power atm.\n\nAs always, DO YOUR OWN DUE DILIGENCE, then short this garbage below your 4'6 standing figure on heels. I'm not a financial advisor.\n\n**EDIT title mistake was cuz ur wife was distracting me**\n\nEdit #2 - 5\/17 - I have sold my position for 40% profit, but it ran to 90%.

The goal was to visualize differences between the holders of different stocks and to try to identify instances of users attempting to manipulate discussion in a bad faith manner.\n\nIn order to do this, I went through ticker by ticker and looked at all accounts who had mentioned the ticker in the last 3 years. I then went through those accounts and looked at a few different metrics. The first thing I looked at was how many days it had been since they had first commented on WSB. I also looked at what proportion of their comments on WSB contained references to the ticker in question. Lastly, I calculated the sentiment of their comments mentioning the ticker.\n\nA visualization of all of those metrics looks something like this:\n\n[GME audience graph](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/s6rkc7yke4z61.png?width=2016&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a854d11b0dc90961d39fd191d1c957282861554)\n\nThis makes it quite easy to compare the holders of different stocks, for example we can compare the above visualization for GME with the visualization below for AMD. This provides the immediate and obvious conclusion that fewer newcomers to WSB have been discussing Lisa Su, as evidenced by the more rightward leaning distribution of points along the x-axis.\n\n[AMD audience graph](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/spxfexoie4z61.png?width=2016&format=png&auto=webp&s=aaf73292bc2d93feda0a4cfaef0acccb1074f949)\n\nBut it also allows you to identify attempts at manipulating discussion. For example, this large dark dot in the upper left of the GME graph looks rather sus. On a quick hover we can see that one user\u00a0has been talking about GME an awful lot and doesn\u2019t seem to have had very nice things to say.\n\n[Sus](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/8gjv0itue4z61.png?width=1732&format=png&auto=webp&s=93f568296f1c6324c18d8f505b4465f142483721)\n\nLooking at their profile, the math seems to check out.\n\n[Their profile](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/fkgdsmure4z61.png?width=2144&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e596d35c7b50be174f5f6ca67ea6b5b87d73597)\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that this post isn\u2019t meant to insinuate that there's a ton of people out there exhibiting this type of behavior. On the contrary, accounts like the one shown above were quite rare and if there are people participating in the discussion threads in bad faith, it\u2019s in a less blatantly spammy fashion.\n\nIf there's interest, I will make an anonymized version of these visualizations publicly available.","223":"Investing 101: For WSB fresh meat Hello  WSB, You might recognize me as the author of that shitty GME DD (that was taken down for \"hate violations\" rip old wsb) that never came true. Actually, I think there still may be truth to the post. Maybe HF's are hiding SI, maybe my initial date was off and we are still prime for a squeeze soon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut this post is not about gamestop. I am writing this post to answer a question that melvins bot asked me: How the actual fuck do you make money trading options and you don't know what \"writing a put\" means?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell I do know what writing a put means, but I believe the newbies of WSB would like to hear my answer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow do you make money in the stock market if you aren't a financial professional? The answer is simple: The Long\/Short Portfolio\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat is Long\/Short? The premise of a long\/short portfolio is to be prepared for anything that could happen in the market. Even the best traders in the world can't guess and time every single economic event. The goal of the long\/short is to have a portfolio set up that can make money in any market. The most basic long\/short combination is SPY\/VIX. If you compare the charts, they are pretty much exact inverses of each other. Because of this, you can protect yourself against a market crash.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo give an example of how I use the SPY\/VIX, I had spy investments that were up 25% around the 13th of april. My belief is that gamestop will squeeze soon, and when it does, the rest of the market will sell off. To act on this belief, I pulled most of my gains out of the spy and slightly increased my position in the VIX. This \"reaction\" can be triggered by your personal beliefs in the market, gamestop was just an example. If you only purchase the vix when it is near an all time low, and never purchase the spy at an all time high, you will have a foolproof hedge\\* Not to mention, the vix does not just pop on devastating market events. Normal corrections can be profited from through the vix. As you can see, this set up is made for protection. For example, if you were invested in the VIX and S&P before the covid crash, your vix investment would have increased just as much as your spy decreased. If you sold your vix, and waited a year, your spy would be back to it's previous value, and you would pocket the profit from the vix.\n\n\\*Foolproof as in one investment will hedge the other. A 50\/50 vix spy split will not be profitable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are many ways to set up a long\/short portfolio. SPY\/VIX is the simplest, and probably the least profitable because it is created for this very reason. Perhaps an investor could find cyclical stocks that benefit from the others loss, and use that as a long\/short. It's also possible to find cyclical stocks that are at a very low price, and hedge with more mainstream investments\/tools, just like a certain DFV. It's ok to gamble on meme stocks as long as your portfolio has a long\/short backbone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll in all, it is not possible to guess everything that will happen. So how do good traders make money even if they don't understand the exact intricacies and implications of options, or even economic functions in general? Long\/short. They don't know everything. They just use the tools available to them to be prepared for everything.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOk cool lots of talk about strategy but this is WSB and you're here for options. So how do you use long\/short with options? Invest the exact same way a boomer would, but with leaps. What is the difference between parking your spare cash in S&P shares vs S&P leap calls for 2 years? If you are an active investor, there is no difference in risk. I would\n\nargue that through periodic vix investments, it is even less risky then letting your cash sit in shares. The benefit is that the return of the leap S&P options will return much more profit then the shares.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDisclaimer: I'm not responsible for any money you lose. And please, if you don't know options, research a lot before playing with them. From personal experience, it is very very easy to lose money. If you want to practice the long\/short, use SPY\/VIXY shares for a safer start. If you are new to investing in general, paper trade first.  This is my own approach to the market. I am sharing it because I got my start in the market through WSB. This sub has cycles. It's normal for awhile, then a post hits the front page and there's a huge influx of noobs. Eventually, the words of the OGs get through to the noobs, and they learn the game. I think this new cycle has brought more newbies then the OGs can keep up with. So here's my advice, take it or leave it\n\nEdit:   I am not a professional ","224":"See the Light that Burry has Shown US! So... it\u2019s getting bloody.. but it\u2019s not a major correction.. not yet. The terrible jobs report, the worst miss in several decades has insured JPOW isn\u2019t even going to consider raising rates anytime soon. He is committed to nearing full employment numbers before that is even on the table. However, slowing down of quantitative easing is happening... you know, they aren\u2019t injecting as much money into the economy and buying bonds... the 20 year yield will slowly creep up... but even if it hits 2%, that is still ridiculously low. Bottom line, for a while there is still nowhere else to get yield but equities for the trillions of dollars still sloshing around out there... that said.. the market has now changed, you need to accept that. As Michael Burry has pointed out, hyper inflation is coming because of the huge spike in household savings in just one year. It\u2019s ascending to a level that historically has taken six years in just one. So you\u2019re simply not going to win trying to drive up stocks that have no to little revenue and trad at a p\/e that is 100+... those days are over... Michael Burry... The Godfather in many ways of WSB, and DFV, the man who spotted GameStop before you even knew GameStop was a publicly traded company, is laughing as us trying to chase the same old stocks... we need to think differently...\n\nSo what is that? Well. We need to follow his lead, how does he screen for stocks, how does HE for stocks and make his decisions? Read this:\n\nhttps:\/\/www.google.com\/amp\/s\/25iq.com\/2016\/03\/25\/a-dozen-things-ive-learned-from-dr-michael-burry-about-investing-2\/amp\/\n\nOk... after reading that... apply that to what you can trade, right now, following those principles. You will find, beyond a shadow of a doubt, ViacomCBS VIAC is the Alpha in this market. Stop thinking of how to fuck hedge funds over by trying to squeeze a stock, and start actually playing the game better than them. Stop letting them take advantage, like they are right now, giving us a sense of false empowerment. Because that is what has happened, and they will torch all the stocks we think we control. \n\nSo let\u2019s get back to the core of what made GameStop come to all of our attention, and that was the value investing tenets of Michael Burry and further championed by DFV. It doesn\u2019t have to be ViacomCBS. There are other deep value plays that are a discount from growing intrinsic value. But whatever you do, get back to their what GameStop was really about. Value investing. Don\u2019t kid yourself if was more than that. How we really win is making smart investing\/trading decisions, not yoloing and just giving it all back","225":"$NOK DeeDee: Get Your Diamond Hands Off Me You Damn Dirty Ape$ Hey MouthBreathers, listen up. If you sold Nokia during the run-up then you just hate money. NOK got caught up in the GME saga and now the stock has a stink on it thanks to the mainstream media and others who don\u2019t understand how a Short Squeeze works, and how GME went parabolic in one week. Let's keep in mind, there were some good and truthful DD posts on NOK in December\/January, and some great fucking DD on Nok in the last couple months. I suspect it went from $4 to $9 just from the massive influx of new members checking out our old posts, trying to find an affordable seat on the Rocketship. No, Nokia doesn't have a ton of short interest. But I still really like the stock and I\u2019d like to tell you why, and a little bit about our future re: John Titor\n\n\\>Let's not forget about when this wasn't ALL about fucking the shorts, jeezus christ.. NOK is different from that bullshit, because it truly has deep fucking value. And believe me, this goes DEEP.. They don't manufacture or sell phones anymore. The only connection they have in making and selling phones is the Nokia brand name being licensed out to a Taiwanese manufacturing company called HDM Global. Almost all the company's revenue comes from Wireless Network Infrastructure and Internet Routing Equipment. Let's go back and track this evolution --> In 2010 this only generated 30% of its revenue (Networking Products, Cellular Base Stations, etc) -- In 2020 this made them 85% of their revenue!! Nokia transformed itself into Wireless Technology Company you fucking retards!! They did this through a series of Autistic Acquisitions \"AA\" -- In April of 2011 they acquired the Wireless Network Infrastructure Assets of Motorola Solutions (this basically gave Nokia all of Motorola's 2G 3G 4G assets) --> In August of 2013 Nokia acquired Nokia\/Siemens Network joint venture and renamed the division \"Nokia Networks\" and that same year Nokia sold its entire mobile phone division to Microsoft --> The in early 2016, Nokia agreed to acquire Alcatel-Lucent for $15.6 Billion which gave then all of their Wireless Technology, Routers, Switches, and Optical Tech within Alcatel as well as Bell Labs (formerly an Alcatel-Lucent division) -- This final deal gave Nokia the massive scale they have now to compete with the industry giants like Ericsson and Huawei head to fucking head (yeah.. this is real you idiots) And we know that Huawei is literally banned in multiple countries around the world soo... So where am I going with this, and why will they emerge as one of most important companies the near future?? \\*\\*REEFSHARK - AI DRIVEN 5G WIRELESS NETWORKS - NETWORK SLICING - AND THE POWER OF THE FUTURE\\*\\* Take an extra retard pill for the rest of this DD post, you're gonna need it. They have been building themselves up to this moment. ReefShark is the key here, 5G Network is the door, and AI Driven 5G Network Slicing is the living room of the future. Nokia has this proprietary chip that will play a big role in how 5G will be available. It will ease the load of 5G Network rollout because it has a 50%-%60 reduction in energy use, which is an outstanding selling point to the industries looking to tap into 5G bandwidth. It is the most efficient chip of its kind, by far, with the added benefit of boosting antenna performance. This efficiency is necessary to the way different industries and companies will utilize the 5G Network. They will go through MVNO (MOBILE VIRTUAL NETWORK OPERATOR) to basically rent out their 5G bandwidth from a cloud. This is called \\*Network Slicing\\* for all u chimps out there. For example, Tesla will rent out their own slice of dedicated 5G Bandwidth. More than 1,000 companies use MVNO already and most apes have not even heard of it yet. Here is how Nokia fits into all of this techy garbage: NOK IS ALREADY THE BIGGEST PLAYER IN THIS MARKET SPACE (they made up $4.5 billion of the $66.9 billion of \"Telecom Software and Services\" in 2019) AND \\*REEFSHARK\\* MAKES THEM THE UNCHALLENGED LEADER IN THIS EVERGROWING MARKET WITH AI POWERED NETWORK CAPABILITIES<\n\n\\*\\*\\*BONUS LEVEL\\*\\*\\* Last year NASA selected Nokia's Bell Labs division to supply the 4G LTE communications network for the moon soon. No joke, the ACTUAL Moon, not emoji moon. Before the end of 2022, they will put a highly functioning 4G network on the lunar surface in preparation for the planned 2024 return mission to the Moon. Drop the crayons for a second and think about this... Ok now eat the red one (it's the same colors as your wife's butthole after her bf leaves your driveway in his big loud pickup truck) Your stupid little smooth brain is probably wondering what all this old 4G talk is about with all the 5G shit rolling out nationwide, changing the course of history... Answer--> the lunar surface is relatively flat so there won't be interference with the cheaper, more practical 4G network. We are talking about putting a mobile network into space you retards so stfu. The signal will travel further, it just makes more sense. They must start somewhere, though this will evolve into 5G up there eventually. \\*\\*NASA could've given this contract to anyone, but THEY CHOSE NOKIA because they believe in them!! They believe Nokia has the best performing Wireless Network Equipment.. So I like the fucking stock ok?!! --> Insert Rocket Emojis, Fire, Boom, Flags, all that shit right here <--\n\nThe time to buy in is now..","226":"180K position in $INO (Inovio) upcoming positive catalyst next 9 days.

They still plan to open sites in USA but most of the trials will be global. They will apply with FDA during Q1 to lift the partial clinical hold hoping to start in Q2. The goal is global phase III trial and looking with external sources of funding.

This will be important in providing protection as per our phase III effacicy trial which will start later this summer.\n\nQ5 - Can you see boosting with the INO-4800? What is the medium term view for this vaccine.\n\nA5 - Many experts globally feel like COVID-19 vaccination will require annual seasonal boosting. If they are correct. A vaccine that can be boosted safely and tolerably seasonally over and over again will be important. After the pandemic we will have endemic COVID-XX which will require boosters and INO-4800 will be important to vaccinate people. They can also be used to boost other first generation vaccines that have already been used. INO-4802 is a further generation ahead and will be a pan-COVID vaccine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQ6 - E Chan from Wayne Right - Can you tell us if INovio is going to put some of their capital in global Covid-19 research.\n\nA6 - We have over 500 million in cash right now and that is one of our strengths. We want to maintain that and limit our expenses. We are currently are in the process of working with external sources of funding to expand our INO-4800 trial in the US and globally. We are focusing on places where we feel Covid-19 vaccines are needed globally. We will have more information published in the next few weeks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQ7 -  Piper Sandler - Can you comment the neutralizing antibody response in comparison to convalence plasma. What gives you confidence the reaction from the investigators and subjects?\n\nA7 - The geometric mean titer presented in the pre-pub shows excellent level of neutralizing antibodies. This is specially apparent for the 2 mg group. The confidence intervals are very strong.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nClosing Remarks: Dr.Joseph Kim\n\nINO-4800 phase 3 trial info coming out in the next few weeks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;","227":"Ex Market Maker Ape calls it Business, not necessarily Manipulation &#x200B;\n\n[JJ Gorilla keeps it real](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/50ykgvtqwux61.png?width=2192&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f8a339da6c0b18d27b94905d38d59a6d4451a2e)\n\nI just listened to [two podcasts](https:\/\/youtu.be\/chE2OEToxOg) where the ex-market maker JJ Gorilla u\/vwaptrader1 tells it from the other side.\n\n  \nAs retail traders, we have to admit that we chase price, but we should learn from our mistakes as quickly as possible. One way to do that is to learn the mechanics and business of doing a deal.\n\nIn episode 187, JJ goes on to say why he feels the $GME action wasn't all business and more needs to be considered to what is going on from those who hold the stock and how impressed he was with r\/wallstreetbets. From what I took from the convo, in essence, he has a gut feeling that someone is using the hype to get out of GME and he's looking to the management.\n\nWhat was even more interesting to me was the way he talks about Supply and the order of events in which the Business gets done.  As he explained that Supply is the key to everything and how a market maker's job is to facilitate those that need to sell their supply of stock\/securities\/assets etc. and to provide liquidity to those traders looking to buy up to that Supply.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ooocpx9yyux61.png?width=3162&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc76f4a3cad4a3c559012ee373905ee9f94003e5\n\nThe Gap and Trap move he describes in the podcast played out to the letter yesterday in the Nasdaq, so I have no reason not to look more into what this ex-market maker has to say.

Record low supply of homes. New listings selling on average in just 18 days, also a record pace. 48% of buyers are confident now is the right time to buy real estate. Where are these people getting the money from, you ask? By taking MORTGAGES! High lumber prices, high copper prices, high home prices? Yup, all that money comes from mortgages. Power to those who buy houses with cash, but most of the people need a mortgage. And guess who is in the mortgage business? You betcha, UWMC.\n\n# RKT's earnings were a dissaster, UWMC's will too\n\nUmmm, did you know Mat Ishibia (the CEO of UWMC) gave an ultimatum about a month ago, that brokers must choose who they want to work with. Either RKT or UWMC. Guess whom they picked?\n\nListen to the CEO: \"*out of my 12000 brokers less than 500 said they were gonna go with them, you will see that in the Q2 numbers*\" - [https:\/\/twitter.com\/RickardBalls\/status\/1390088528764284935?s=20](https:\/\/twitter.com\/RickardBalls\/status\/1390088528764284935?s=20)\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/8gwamgh5nrx61.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ea48f104e76caf6a368cbe5ef2a9b86ae43eebc\n\n# Dividend\n\nI know most of you goofs here do not care about dividend because you are all busy making 100% a week gains, but in the real world, where you actually do get to drive a lambo, consistent predictable income like dividends are a big deal. You see, UWMC pays $0.40 per year for every share you own. This is fixed! It does not matter how much the stock price is. However, what matters is that your dividend yield depends on the price you pay to acquire those shares. Confused? Let me give you an example:\n\n* $0.40 dividend per share \/ (UWMC at $10 a share) = 4.00% annual dividend yield\n* $0.40 dividend per share \/ (UWMC at $9 a share) = 4.44% annual dividend yield\n* $0.40 dividend per share \/ (UWMC at $8 a share) = 5.00% annual dividend yield\n* $0.40 dividend per share \/ (UWMC at $7 a share) = 5.71% annual dividend yield - **WE ARE HERE!**\n* $0.40 dividend per share \/ (UWMC at $5 a share) = 8.00% annual dividend yield\n* $0.40 dividend per share \/ (UWMC at $3 a share) = 13.33% annual dividend yield\n* $0.40 dividend per share \/ (UWMC at $1 a share) = 40.00% annual dividend yield\n\nBasically, it's a gift from heavens to be able to buy a dividend paying stock at low levels because you are locking in a higher % return. Now some of you smartypants will say, *\"don't buy a stock just for the dividend\"*, and I agree. In some cases, when the company **does not generate cash flow** they will have trouble paying the dividend and will be forced to cut it. However, **UWMC** has no problem with cash flow, meaning $0.40 dividend per share is here to stay for the foreseeable future.\n\nFun fact, RKT pays no dividend. Institutions know this. They care about predictable stream of cash a.k.a. dividends. BlackRock knows this, hence why they reported on May 2, owning 11.15% of UWMC's float.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/s4oibshivrx61.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&s=9724aeb147bdd05e8e28cd08babb8b4a06c2c63b\n\n# Russell Index\n\nRemember the Russell index hype? Remember how the price went from $7.63 to $9.62 in a matter of few days?\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/1tb8i3ikprx61.png?width=1348&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2b49973b32b0f6171a51cbf110250ab48b3187d\n\nWell the inclusion story is still pretty much on the table. Russell made a mistake. UWMC is in touch with them and **UWMC is eligible for consideration at the annual review in June 2021**. Yes, that's in about a month from now. Don't believe me? You should.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/xxjhba02qrx61.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=49913305ca2b760bca63a596b977f86b64b62961\n\n# Bluffing\n\nThe definition of bluffing in poker is - ***betting heavily on a weak hand in order to deceive opponents***. I know what you beginners fear - \"*What if my stock goes to zero?*\" Do you hear yourself? America's largest wholesale dividend paying mortgage broker soon to join Russell 1000 going to zero? Are you that dumb? Did Wall Street pros managed to fool you that much? Remember bluff stories like:\n\n* **We covered on GME** \\- No you did not! The stock ain't going below $100 and it's been months since you covered!\n* **AMC is going bankrupt** \\- No it's not! It went up 348% since January 2021!\n* **UWMC is worthless. You should buy real estate at all time highs, let us buy this shitty dividend paying stock that's going to zero.** \\- Are you gonna fall for it again?\n\n# Mathematical pressure\n\nYou see, when you deal with single digit stocks like AMC at $2 in January 2021, GME at $5 in August 2020, there is a point at which there is just no meat left. There is only a bone. You can't short stock into an oblivion. There is nothing left to short! You are running a risk.\n\nAt some point, the rewards from going long way outweigh the risk of going short on a beaten down stock. Melvin did not understand this concept and that's why he lost billions. Simple as that.\n\nYou wanna buy low and sell high. Not short sell low and buy to cover high.\n\n# Holiday Party\n\nDoes your company invite Ludacris to sing at your holiday party?

Google trends show the peak in search volume for terms like GameStop, Short Squeeze, and Day Trading in the last week of January.\n\nEspecially the trading apps Robinhood and Webull saw a significant increase in app installs and new accounts. As a result, the payment for order flow income for Robinhood grew from $91 million in the first quarter of 2020 to $331 million in 2021. Webull had the most substantial percentage gain with $3 million in Q1\/2020 to $46 million in Q1\/2021.\n\nThe payment for order flow split by broker for the first quarter of 2021 reveals that TD Ameritrade received most payments, followed by Robinhood and E*Trade.\n\nTD Ameritrade: $429 million\nRobinhood: $331 million\nE*Trade: $139 million\nCharles Schwab: $78 million\nWebull: $46 million","230":"WEBULL to FIDELITY Transfer...PLEASE READ IF YOU ARE ON WEBULL AND CONSIDERING TRANSFERRING **PLEASE READ IF YOU ARE ON WEBULL AND CONSIDERING TRANSFERRING**\n\nI finally transferred my GME shares in Webull into Fidelity...but I thought i'd make this post to shed some light on the \"partial transfer\" vs \"full transfer\"\n\nI've have to do both since my partial transfer never went through...\n\n**PARTIAL TRANSFER**\n\n\\- This will require a settled cash balance of $75 in your WEBULL account prior to the transfer being completed...\n\n\\- My partial transfer request was never completed and just on hold with no updates to the status on Fidelity's transfer tracker since 04\/24 until I called Fidelity to find out that Webull had rejected the transfer...couldn't get Webull on the line to ask them why...\n\n\\- However, i decided to just initiate a full transfer after my friend was able to successfully transfer his shares over (read on)\n\n**FULL TRANSFER**\n\n\\- Followed my friend's advice who did a full transfer of his account into Fidelity and I'm glad I did this.\n\n\\- I initiated the full transfer on 04\/30 and was completed yesterday (so it will take about **3-4 days** for a full transfer, much quicker than the 1-2 weeks that they give as the amount of time they allow to process). (my estimated date of completion was 05\/13 but it completed yesterday 05\/05 and shares were available in my Fidelity account when I checked this morning 05\/06).\n\n\\- In initiating a full transfer, it seems Fidelity actually paid that $75 transfer fee because **there was a $75 cash debit balance** that was transferred into my Fidelity account **along with my GME shares**.\n\n\\- And now i just had to deposit $75 into my fidelity account (which they're much quicker about) to maintain my account balance without any negative cash debits.\n\n\\- This route was FAR EASIER than having to go about the deposit $75 into Webull, wait for it to clear and then settle, then partial transfer, and wait for the partial transfer to complete...\n\nI think this is a GOOD OPTION for ***those who do NOT already have a $75 settled cash balance in their Webull accounts***...like me, i didn't have $75 in settled cash and to ACH deposit, wait for it to clear, and then wait for it to settle in my Webull account would take about 7-10 days...plus the time it takes to complete the partial transfer from Webull into fidelity......I suggest instead of going through that hassle, to initiate a full transfer as it will only take about 3-4 days (took my friend 3, took me 4 but this could have been due to me initiating the transfer on a Friday evening).\n\n\\- However, if you DO have a $75 settled cash balance in your Webull account, then based on previous posts, my suggestion would be to just initiate a partial transfer through Fidelity as there would be no reason for the transfer request to be held up from Webull's end. This partial transfer, based on previous posts, seems to be completing in \\~2 days as opposed to the full transfer's duration of \\~3-4 days.\n\nJust wanted to shed some light on this as I know there are many apes who are reluctant to transfer their shares into a broker with the assets to back up their positions...but if you're hesitating from transferring from Webull due to the $75 transfer fee etc, then I think this post should help you in getting your GME shares over to Fidelity ASAP based on your individual situation.\n\nEdit: Not financial advice. What do I know? \ud83d\udc8e\u270a\ud83c\udffc","231":"Advice to new investors, from a new investor Advice to New Retards from another relatively new Retard.\n\nI am going to list out a handful of things that even though I had done a fair amount of research before opening up a trading account. It was not nearly enough, and below are things that I in hindsight wish I would have read somewhere or seen advice on.\n\n\u00b7 More often than not, when you read news on a company and expect the price to soar because of that news. That news is probably already reflected in the price for that stock. The best example of this is DKNG for my portfolio. The news for this company in Q1 has been fucking outstanding. New partnerships and or exclusive partnerships with almost every major sports organization. New states legalizing Sportsbooks. Cathie Wood buying a large number of shares for her portfolios. Fantastic YoY growth. Purchasing or expanding their media footprint. At face value, all of this news should have them trading at least 40% higher than what they were at for Jan 1. But it isn\u2019t it is trading at about 15% higher than what it was then. As I mentioned, more often than not all of that news is factored into the stock days if not weeks before any public announcement or article publishing that.\n\n\u00b7 Take your fucking profits and cut your fucking losses. The best advice I have ever heard is to set your profit\/loss orders. 20% for-profit and 16% for loss. Set it and forget it. Period. Or if you are comfortable taking any profit at all, take your 5% and exit. Whatever you think is best for your financial situation and portfolio. Or if you are long on the stock, don\u2019t even look at the daily for it. If you know your entry, and you know where you want to exit. The same thing set it and forget it. Looking at the daily will only cause stress. Trust me, I fucking know. RKT is my example of that. I currently have 25 shares in RKT on an AVG entry of $22.8. But I should\u2019ve taken my fucking profit when it peaked at $43 in March. Pocketed my gains, and entered back in after it dropped and averaged out. But no, I held. I held hoping their Q1 earnings would drive it higher than what it was in March. Guess what. It fucking didn\u2019t. It dropped to a little over $19 per share today. I am long on RKT, as they are going to be an absolute juggernaut for the next 5 years in their industry. BUT I should\u2019ve taken my profits and re-entered\n\n\u00b7 I\u2019m retarded. You\u2019re retarded. We\u2019re all fucking dipshits and if you think you\u2019re not then you\u2019re probably the biggest dipshit in here. Now that is out of the way. Don\u2019t invest in a stock\/company if you don\u2019t understand what the fuck they are actually doing. MVIS is that example for me. Read pages and pages of honestly still very good DD. But it might as well of been written in hieroglyphs because I didn\u2019t and don\u2019t understand a god damn word of it. Something about LIDAR and some beep boop shit that is going to enable robots and cars to detect shit. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t understand it. But  I invested, and closed a position in a different great company because it was trending in the cesspool of mouth breathers. Entered at $22 and cut my losses at $16 per share. YTD, because of what I threw at it. It is my most significant loss and I am sure they are a great company with a giant upside in the future, but I don\u2019t understand it and won\u2019t be opening another position on it unless my low functioning brain can eventually process what they are doing (probably not going to happen). Oh well, it taught me a great lesson.\n\n\u00b7 Trying to play earnings is risky, to say the least. Again, RKT is a great example of that. Honestly, their earnings report was overall very good, and they only slightly missed their projections. But because they did miss it, it has fallen around 20%. Also, even if the company beats its earnings projection, it may not increase a whole lot. If any, and for some odd fucking reason it could even go drop. Look at AMD, that ticker confuses me almost as much as DKNG. AMD is a great long stock as well, but good luck trying to predict what the fuck it is actually going to do before, or after earnings. I mean shit, really even daily.\n\n\u00b7 Do you own god damn DD. Read every DD post on here, and take it with a grain of salt. More often than not the DD is pretty well written and researched, but it is almost always written by someone who has a large number of shares or portfolio % in that. It\u2019s like listening to a Wendy\u2019s employee tell you that they have the best fries, and no other fries compared to theirs. Well yeah, mother fucker you work there and have a vested interest in trying to convince me of how great your fries are.\n\n\u00b7 Figure out your own goals with your portfolio. Whether that\u2019s you being a daily trader and closing and opening positions daily or picking your stocks to go long in. Or split your portfolio in half and do both. Up to you, but you need to know what you are trying to achieve with it and have a clear path laid out of doing so.\n\n\u00b7 If you are able to, put everything you can into a Roth IRA, it is exempt from capital gains tax. You can put a maximum of $6,000 in it per year. Do that before you put any money anywhere else. You have to have it longer than 5 years before you should even think about withdrawing any money out of it. But really, you shouldn\u2019t withdraw anything out of it ever. Have an individual account with fuck around money, or to have access for a rainy day or emergency funds or whatever. You will pay capital gains tax on it yearly, but that just is what it is.\n\n\u00b7 ETF\u2019s are boring as fuck and not sexy, but they keep your portfolio balanced and are really just less risky as you are investing in a wide variety of stocks that you might not be able to afford individually. Take BETZ for example. For most investors, especially as they are starting off you may not have the expendable income to just outright purchase stocks like PENN for example. But you can invest in shares with them by purchasing ETFs that already have shares on them.\n\n\u00b7 Paper trading is an underutilized resource. It allows you to experiment in investing without legitimately risking anything financially. Do it. Do it even if you\u2019ve been trading for a while. It is an excellent technique for perfecting or just training yourself on the market.\n\n\u00b7 Finally, you\u2019re not DeepFuckingValue. He researched for months if not years and followed GME as in-depth as he could and read pretty much everything readily available on them. Researched Board members, followed market trends, and ultimately, he had fuck around money where he could throw a significant amount of money at it. Everything, obviously, worked out in his favor but it could have just as easily not. GME could have very easily gone bankrupt as there were a lot of really intelligent people who thought they could and cited them and their business model as very similar to Blockbuster. Chances are you are not going to do the amount of research on any stock, with as much as he did for GME. Don\u2019t pretend you will, and don\u2019t lie to yourself saying you will. I joined here in January, and have learned so much. But again, I\u2019m a fucking idiot and so are you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you have any advice, you wish you would've been told when you first started. Please add it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit Note:\n\n I originally listed TQQQ as an example in the portion of ETFs. Since this post was written as a post for beginners and it was discussed and agreed upon that TQQQ is poor example of that and not a beginner ETF, I changed it to BETZ instead and instead of citing TSLA or NVDA. I list PENN as an example.","232":"KNSA Mega Dip DD Alright retardos and retardettes, this is probably going to get ignored and\/or downvoted into the oblivion on the count of being a potentially good idea, but I'll try to share my flawed wisdom anyways. \n\nThe stock has been way oversold over the last 2 months for no good reason (Other than missing the EPS by $0.08 2 days ago, but more on that later).

It takes a lot of $ to fund research, run trials, etc. Once they get FDA approvals, it takes a few months for end-users\/clinics to place orders for the drugs. The fact that it's being dumped on today's earnings is largely irrelevant to me. I think 3-6 months and this thing will go \ud83d\ude80.\n\n**3) Analysis:** Analyst ratings are hugely positive, at least according to Webull's data. Price targets averages are double of what it's sitting at right now.

The type of mistakes that would likely throw the average person into a full-blown panic attack, or worse...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe first \"issue\" was during the $GME uprising. I woke up like the rest of you, except with a **$234,357.55 cash call** on my account. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Cash Call](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/mrndbfvwxax61.png?width=874&format=png&auto=webp&s=c62fa1ae8a0f65d77c9f75e490d231fd166e4f25)\n\nYou may be thinking, \"you stupid fucking idiot stop playing with margin and that wont happen\", but my account was never even approved for margin lol. I owned **<10 shares** of $GME at the time, and was selling them 1 by 1 as the price travelled through the $300's (sorry). So when I saw that I somehow had unwillingly entered a **short position of 736 SHARES OF $GME AT $22.86**, which my account literally did not have the ability to do, I freaked the fuck out. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/vcil9kxoyax61.png?width=1091&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c50088143246cfe6c270f5d6b66380aa8d837d7\n\nI'm still not sure what happened that day, but E\\*TRADE admitted it was an \"error\" on their end. Huh, what kind of error results in a massive (and impossible) short position on the biggest stock explosion in decades? There wasn't even an order # attached to the trades...imagine being someone who checks their portfolio weekly or monthly rather than 60 times a day, and seeing this shit pop up, not knowing if you made some terrible mistake and your life was completely ruined?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/li4mkcn61bx61.png?width=584&format=png&auto=webp&s=5cc1c9b50fcd678eb7f9a798cc2fd16bcf218966\n\nWell a few months had passed, but last week I decided I finally wanted to upgrade my account to a margin account to allow me to sell a *PMCC* on a deep ITM $NIO call I owned. I had the cash available for the trade I wanted to make (a few thousand), so this shouldn't have been an issue.

I thought that would be the end of it. Until this morning, when I woke up to *\\*drumroll please\\*,* **over $4,000 in cash missing from my account!** I was the lucky winner of the E\\*TRADE lottery, because of all the times I've had to contact support for their \"issues\", I got to pay 1 months salary to a random E\\*TRADE employee! \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Thank you, have a nice day!](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/0bwntrqx2bx61.png?width=1163&format=png&auto=webp&s=63eb6e29eda6d955e9d733854cfe97a7d4157093)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs I write this, the cash has since been deposited back into my account, but how is this acceptable? If the average person looks at their retirement account once a month and sees a hundred thousand dollar cash call, or a twenty thousand dollar 'Fed Call', they may not act rationally - that's a lot of fucking money.

I didn't know that it would garner that much of positive feedbacks and I'm excited to write my TA posts as a series if time allows me to.\n\nWith that being said, I do not plan to write these kind of posts for every trading session days since I would run out of things to say at one point. My intention is to write these kind of posts for days where we see a significant gap-up or gap-down that reinforces the Elliott Wave Theory speculation. I also want to remind you that if the closing price goes below the speculated \"bottom\", the entire theory will be invalidated. I hope you all join me in this bumpy ride and enjoy it together. Anyways, let's get right to what I think about Friday's (4\/30\/21) price action.\n\n# Brief Summary:\n\nAs of 4\/30\/21, CLOV opened at $9.89 and closed at $9.85 with a previous closing price of $10.17 (-3.15%). To simply put it, today was a consolidation day based on the opening price and the closing price. The volume didn't help with the stock's bullish sentiment either as Friday's volume was at 17.38 mil in contrast to Thursday's volume at 68.33 mil. This means Friday's volume was cut down by more than -74.5%; that's 3\/4 of Thursday's total volume, gone for today. Now, I have a few speculations as to why we experienced one of the lowest volumes on Friday ever since the CLOV hype began:\n\n* Continual market beatdown against smaller market caps causing a FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) against retail investors which discouraged investors from purchasing stocks due to the fear of further market beatdown.\n* CLOV's chart on Friday EXACTLY mirrored the NASDAQ 100 chart and NASDAQ's relative volume was the LOWEST out of all three major stock market indices (DOW, NASDAQ, and S&P 500). Don't believe it? Check out the images below.\n   * Based on the images below, it's clear to me that there is a positive correlation to the performance of market index versus CLOV (individual stock) on Friday. This leads to a reasonable assumption that CLOV had a disappointing day NOT because of CLOV's getting \"dumped on\" per se, but rather because the entire market (especially NASDAQ) performed poorly on Friday.\n\n[CLOV's 5 min chart on Friday \\(4\\\/30\\\/21\\)](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/80g8hbo7tqw61.png?width=1825&format=png&auto=webp&s=272a07536e32b9477b8680c72063d3a5fd8141c6)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[NASDAQ's 1 hr chart for Friday](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/7vnsw2p9tqw61.png?width=535&format=png&auto=webp&s=6485b2f802ade83939f2f423f2b88891d551e689)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Daily Chart:\n\n[Revised daily chart for CLOV](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/dbu0mj4mtqw61.png?width=2103&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac30561676da97c754b0c5234956090ae9bd891d)\n\n**Fibonacci retracements:**\n\nWith Friday's bearish price action, it's good to see that we've respected the 23.6% level as a major support rather than letting it become the new resistance level. However, Friday's price action doesn't **necessarily** indicate that Thursday's (4\/29\/21) price action was a bear trap. Depending on the next Monday's overall market performance, volume level, and buying pressure, I think we will be able to get a clearer picture as to whether we are going to use 23.6% level as a support to bounce off from or continue the downward trend. Overall, I do think that we will see 23.6% level being used as a support for CLOV to bounce off on as long as the overall market shows a reversal pattern on Monday.\n\n**Elliott Wave Theory:**\n\nFriday's price action, although it was a minimal dip in the grand scheme of things, does confirm that we are in wave 2 which is a corrective wave. I originally speculated that we will see a healthy pullback to around $8.52 range but since the chart respected the 23.6% level as a support, we may see a bounce earlier and perhaps move on to wave 3. That's a very good thing for all of us who want to see CLOV explode off to Mars. But, of course, this is all contingent upon high volume level and high buying pressure. We will have to continue to observe the price action and the daily chart to find further confirmations that indicate to wave 3 speculation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Friday's (5 min) Chart:\n\n[Friday's \\(5 min\\) chart](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/77zk7810uqw61.png?width=1824&format=png&auto=webp&s=aee8685305104aea32ca0c18b808d01ecb4c23ac)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Friday's RSI](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/z8knwwewvqw61.png?width=1825&format=png&auto=webp&s=14d588e83013c33cb8c7c8af74d5d00e181797ef)\n\n**VWAP:**\n\nToday, I wanted to focus more on the VWAP which is an acronym for 'volume weighted average price'. Simply put, it's a metric used for intraday charts to determine the buying pressure and selling pressure based on that day's volume and share price. The rule of this metric is: **If the candle sticks are above the VWAP line, it's a bullish sentiment and vice versa.**\n\nBased on that rule, we can now look at the 5 min chart and see what's going on with the VWAP line which is colored blue. Looking at the chart, we can see that during the market opening, we stayed **above** the VWAP line with a great start to the volume level. This means that the buying pressure was greater than the selling pressure based on the volume. However, as the trading session went on, the explanation provided from the brief summary section caused the volume level to dry up and die off. And as the volume level went down, you can see how the candle sticks moved **below** the VWAP line which means that the selling pressure was greater than the buying pressure.\n\n**RSI:**\n\nThis is further reinforced by looking at Friday's RSI chart. You can see that during the market opening, RSI trended towards an overbought territory, but as volume level died off RSI eventually corrected itself down to a neutral level, consolidated a bit, and headed over to an oversold level which is correlated to the 5 min price chart above. Based on VWAP and RSI analysis, it is reasonable to assume that CLOV will show a reversal as long as the volume level is high.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Short Interest:\n\n[Fintel's short volume data for CLOV](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/9mz2m7hxuqw61.png?width=1348&format=png&auto=webp&s=5fecd758ddaab8e007c3ad0cde2034f6dbac7a71)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Fintel's short volume data on GME](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ygcg2dozuqw61.png?width=1348&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae003665fe6a2c47d55848cb408325111c1880e2)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Fintel's short volume data on AMC](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/axn54td1vqw61.png?width=1353&format=png&auto=webp&s=87347195aeb549ac565c0d299172340878e26eb0)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[CLOV's stock price history](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/7rkeq9x2vqw61.png?width=1470&format=png&auto=webp&s=74aacd60997173485700b1069fba9c1555a4493f)\n\n**Short Volume:**\n\nLet's take a look at CLOV's short volume as a bonus since people believe there's a potential for short squeeze. According to a quick Google search, it is widely accepted as a fact that 10% short interest ratio is considered 'high' while 20% short interest ratio is considered 'extremely high'. Now take a look at all three of the short volume data on popular stocks like AMC, GME, and then CLOV. And now, take a look at CLOV's stock price history chart with its volume for each trading session days, what do you see?\n\nIt's clear to me as day that shorts are shorting in PROPORTION to the amount of volume level for each trading session day. Whether that day's volume level is extremely high or not, they are shorting CLOV with an average shorting ratio percentage of 23.1% which is considered EXTREMELY HIGH from 4\/19 to 4\/30. To further add, we can see that short volume ratio is pretty much similar across all three stocks. Based on that analysis, I will let you be the judge on whether we have a potential for short squeeze or not.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Conclusion:\n\nIn conclusion, CLOV's share price did NOT necessarily drop on Friday because people are \"dumping\" their shares. We rather saw a slight drop in CLOV's share price on Friday because of market's poor overall performance that led to an extremely low volume level. This led to shorts having a field day by shorting the stock even more as the short volume ratio is consistently at around 20%. **But,** we shouldn't invest in the stock based on the short squeeze potential alone. We should invest in the stock because we believe in the company and the company's management.\n\nThat being said, with 2 days of bearish days for the overall market, I hope to see a green day for the market on Monday and see CLOV bounce off from the $9.66 support. Thank you for reading and I look forward to throwing a champagne party with you all once we are at the moon!\n\n**Tl;dr:** **Today's low volume can be explained by the overall market performance, so don't worry too much about the price action today. BUY and HODL and watch this four petal leaf company go off to the moon with me.**\n\n**Disclaimer:** This is not a financial advice. I'm simply a fellow ape who just likes the company. Invest at your own risk and most importantly, do your own personal due diligence to ensure that the facts are true.\n\n\\*EDIT 1: My position as requested by the mod.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/hcsvtx8n0rw61.png?width=1146&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd0e372ee7fbb5d3920e6b015d77a4d06b59210d","236":"CLOV volume price analysis   \n\nHi fellow traders, this is my first time posting on WSB and wanted to share with you some TA using volume price analysis on CLOV. I got interested in CLOV recently and having profited a lot on GME (bought in shares and options in November). I felt this was my next big bet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/2sx4id9ldlw61.png?width=713&format=png&auto=webp&s=4fabd25308652e8c12e834d7e4f17b77e160b430\n\nFirst of all on the weekly chart, I see signs of the market maker buying during the bear market in this stock that lasted from January to March. At #1, we have a hammer candle with a deep lower wick on very high volume which signals that the market maker is trying to stop the downfall and failed. The stock pursued its fall and reached the buying climax by the market maker in March. I can see this with the high volume and deep lower wick. Having retraced a significant amount since its ATH, the market needed to test this level to see if all the sellers were out of the market. The $7 retest was successful on low volume as we can see with the small doji that printed on the chart in april. The retest was above the ATL signaling strength. The next 4 candles have higher highs, higher lows and very very high volume. The long upper wicks signal that insiders are trying to push the price down but are incapable of breaking the trend because the buying pressure is intense.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/w4oo9rdmdlw61.png?width=713&format=png&auto=webp&s=11d7e1ed18232b575526ec194f840d47fddaa3f4\n\nOn the daily chart, we see the buying climax with the white hammer having a deep lower wick that coincided with the general market bottoming out in March. #2 was an attempt to breakout on high volume but was unsuccessful; the market retreated on falling volume, which is bullish. #3 is a very interesting candle: the stock tried to breakout again but was pushed violently to the downside below $9 on insane volume. Insiders were very desperate to push this stock down. #4 was the breakout on again very high volume. Insiders were trying to push the stock down again but failed! The following candles saw a test of the commitment of the sellers (test of supply) and there was none! Instead, we saw the stock trending lower of declining volume, which is very bullish (this is where I pulled the trigger and got a fill at $9.42 once the stock started climbing again). It didn\u2019t take long for the stock to rise again on high volume, only to be suppressed once again. The battle isn\u2019t over with the bears, but the signals that the bulls are starting to take over are there when you look at price and volume. At the second to last candle we see a bearish candle called the dark cloud cover: it signals a short term downtrend. As we see with the last candle (inverted hammer), the volume is declining once again as sellers are not in the market. This could signal the end of this short-term downtrend, but we need more price action to confirm this. There is a case for a short squeeze in this stock, though I don\u2019t believe it will squeeze like GME since the percentage of the float shorted is nowhere near what GME was. Clearing the $14 mark on high volume is very important to see this stock soar to the ATH of $17.50 and beyond. The last candles on the chart signal a bumpy ride ahead; the bears will not give up easily but when they do, this bet will be a very rewarding one.\n\nP.S.: Don\u2019t take my word for it and do your own DD.\n\nCLOV 15$C 06\/18 + 550 shares.","237":"Understanding Serverless: Fastly, Software-Defined Networks, and the Cloudflare vs. Fastly Debate # Table of Contents\n\n1.

WSB has grown and in my view, our committed analysts can outpace Wall Street analysts at places like Morningstar or The Motley Fool.

They can be used together.**\n\n[Support](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/8nw4s6mlojw61.png?width=1220&format=png&auto=webp&s=0060e02dd4363ce7e7cc4cf3b59b3438603b9bc7)\n\nThis is a common question that is asked by investors interested in the cloud computing space from both novices and experts alike. In my view, the comparison isn\u2019t very useful and usually illustrates some misunderstanding between the two product spaces. Fastly is focused on real-time services and acts as an optimizing layer for existing network providers. Cloudflare is a general network competitor. You can use both, and most do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[General purpose needs](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/8g9lk7uhwjw61.png?width=2314&format=png&auto=webp&s=bdaadd144aa9a0b64a37a3c05a6f236c965fefb6)\n\nIn a crude sense, Fastly focuses on convenience akin to the services provided by Costco, while players like Akamai or Cloudflare focus on the convenience brought to you by gas stations or companies like Walmart. It\u2019s not to say that one is better than the other, because it's not. They just solve different problems with completely different approaches. You may not go to Costco as often as you do Walmart, but when you go to Costco, you're picking up and utilizing a lot more.\n\nThis explains why Fastly takes the approach to generally co-operate with other service providers and is able to provide a range of services for things like Snapchat storage, Spotify network meshes, Google Cloud services, and other real-time demands from the tech industry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\"While a convenience store is generally closer to a person's home, it has a limited set of items for sale. If the person drives a few more miles to the supermarket, they could get all of their groceries in one trip. In this case, convenience stores represent the approach taken by the legacy CDN's with many local POPs and the supermarkets represent Fastly's approach with fewer, larger ones.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCloudflare has ambitions to compete with the likes of companies like Amazon and attempts to be a general purpose solution for networking on the internet - it wants to make the internet more accessible, safer, and fair. Fastly seeks to solve specific problems on the internet. So in a nutshell, one is a general solution and the other is a specialized solution.\n\nAn example of specialized needs provided by Fastly is like Reddit\u2019s execution of the r\/place experiment in 2017 - which allowed millions of users to collaborate and draw an image together pixel by pixel with rules and regulations in real-time.\n\n[Real-time collaboration services meets art and communtiy.](https:\/\/i.redd.it\/2kf4qnoorjw61.gif)\n\nThis is only one example of many. The way I like to frame it is by viewing real-time and collaborative services as a relatively new economic need, and thus a product like Fastly has a high demand from organizations that excel with these kinds of services. You may see associations with Fastly from places like Spotify, Ticketmaster, or The New York Times - all of which have specific needs or demands when it comes to content delivery and network management.\n\n[world-class research](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/m9muspwsrjw61.png?width=1594&format=png&auto=webp&s=72b18b1b49ed8aed906a2b9936beb1e29a5479a1)\n\nA big advantage that Fastly has in this regard is the fact that they often build their network with the intention of being world-class from top to bottom, from the code they write to the metals that build their points of presence. They are effectively able to choose their destiny as a product versus having to race the horses in competition. They research, experiment, and execute on the boundary of networking, making it a superb way to play the serverless and networking industry from a long point of view.\n\nThe result of this approach means higher quality servers and less need to rely on the number of PoPs used.  This ultimately means that Fastly spends less on building and maintaining servers while being an order of magnitude faster at the same time. They are efficient and provide value per the dollar spent on their network from customers and internal alike.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[the capex equation](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/s9n1xm5zrjw61.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=65e97432b694a884e1445db1793377e0f3eefa8c)\n\nCloudflare's team of course counters this by saying that speed is not nearly as important as Cloudflare's ability to be compliant to global requirements. This is completely nonsense if you consider that in the long-term, Fastly's general approach is to solve specific problems rather than to function as a general purpose network.\n\nThe compliance debate is a bogus marketing attempt when Fastly's speeds, in the microseconds, is exponentially faster than Cloudflare's serverless implementation that sits in the milliseconds range. This is frankly an example of how Matt Prince is warmer to investors and plays a stronger marketing game than Artur Bergman, who seemingly could not care to impress Wall Street funds and plays for the long-term.\n\n[Matt Prince's Hierarchy of Developer's Needs](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/9afefjyasjw61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=af129b27bf734c74c0d8a039341ff03b126af5c1)\n\nWhy does this distinction matter? Well what of the requirements where networking speed and response times are critical, like hospital communications, stock market crashes, wildfires, or other problems unique to the challenges of running a network?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The way to think about this is, what do you pay for, right? I mean if you -- and where are these moments that are valuable. When Tiger Wood walks down with the 18th green the Masters and God willing he is able to do that again, that matters, that moment matters. Everyone is going to tweet about it, and everyone wants to see it, the company that is in charge of that cares desperately about that content. When you send a gift across the Internet, like it's not monetized in the same way, it's not as valued.. So where we have seen the value is in content that is highly valuable to customers and their end consumer, where they're willing to pay for it and the quality, and the security and the scale of that deeply matters. And we have always focused our work on that type of content. There's plenty of content that just scrapes by and is low commodity. Every month, they want a lower price. That's a different market from our perspective, and we're not in it.\" - Fastly CEO\n\n# Understanding Content Delivery\n\n**- TL;DR You have data, you cut the data into smaller pieces, send it across a network, and rebuild those pieces somewhere else.**\n\n[The global cache](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/a92mp9wesjw61.png?width=951&format=png&auto=webp&s=c98e66b61a7b13f89a4556399c8264a038bb16ac)\n\nIt\u2019s helpful to understand the 7  steps that protocols take as they travel across and through a network around the world. This model is known as the OSI model and it\u2019s not necessarily the end-all-be-all model that governs the internet; but it is a useful framework to understand at a glance.\n\nThere are many complexities that go behind these protocols and they are the subject of intense debate or research. At the same time, many of these steps follow a similar process - translate or transform the data that\u2019s received and sent.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Edge computing, an extension of the cloud.](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/r5k1yknbyjw61.png?width=472&format=png&auto=webp&s=60bbe4420f4025c8c791d62c569453ce82a8a8b0)\n\nFor example, the web browser translates the data into machine bytecode in a similar way that a networking router will need to translate information into a stream of 0 and 1 signals. This may not make too much sense yet, but just remember that it\u2019s just a series of translations and preparations of data into different segments so that it could be read and understood by other pieces of hardware.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Email, zoom calls, pins, streams, different network flavors.](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/kvhajfjtujw61.png?width=1762&format=png&auto=webp&s=2570ebd03b9fd5c08989b0b5551d9eea2c5c3c44)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. **Application Layer:** You initiate a Zoom call. It has passed through the application layer using an real-time messaging protocol. It sends the video to the presentation layer.\n2. **Presentation Layer:** The video data is received and compressed. It gets sent to the session layer.\n3. **Session Layer:** A communication session is initiated. A network communication is initiated, with various receivers at some set of defined internet address routes.\n4. **Transportation Layer:** The data is further segmented and prepared for transportation.\n5. **Network Layer:** Once the data has reached this stage, the segments are converted to packets.\n6. **Data Link Layer:** The data is sliced into frames and delivered to the physical layer.\n7. **Physical Layer:** The frames are converted into a bitstream of 0s and 1s as a way to represent that final stage of data representation, which are signals that along a physical medium like a cable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[OSI Model](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/68fe020vsjw61.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f4ae86782c3c87978af6e4a9bf46d1b0f695347)\n\nAs the data reaches its destination, it goes through the 7 layer process again in the opposite direction, where the data is received at the physical layer and concludes at the application layer (the person who you sent an Zoom call to). There\u2019s a reason that the network use trucks or mail deliveries as ways to compare the process as it can be strikingly similar at times.\n\nWhat are the complexities related to delivering a letter, a box of clothes, or a Home Depot truck full of metals and wood? So that\u2019s the essence behind content-delivery networks - preparing information and delivering it with optimal paths.\n\nIt\u2019s worth taking some time to ponder and think about this. They may be words or ideas that you\u2019ve heard - routers, bitstreams, addresses, and so on. What is the difference between collecting a Pinterest pin, playing a Spotify stream, or setting up a Zoom call without a video? How do we utilize location data when it comes to COVID containment efforts? What are the consequences of correcting a news article, fact checking a social media post, or reconciling the differences in video game connections in a game like Call of Duty?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Networking meets human experiences](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/d5nbigz1tjw61.png?width=690&format=png&auto=webp&s=d39cdad6269f4b7d224fff12e6c39adc60584d60)\n\nWith this developing model in mind, consider again how Cloudflare is particularly invested in the overall health of a network, while Fastly is primarily concerned with pushing the network further. They seek to solve different platforms, while having obvious overlaps at the same time.\n\n# Serverless Compute - The Event Driven Network\n\n**TL;DR Serverless allows software engineers to spend more time building products.**\n\n[The event driven network](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/lhez9rq6tjw61.png?width=1260&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb377d7a5f2c3d3995c4c56ec0a5b925a860e0f7)\n\nWhat serverless architecture accomplishes is that it adds programmability and portability to the cloud clusters and the network. There are two major benefits to serverless computing:\n\n1. It grants developers access to complex functions out of the box.\n\nFor example, if a developer wants to create a lightning fast application where taking an image of a crop plant returns some analysis about the health of the crop or warning signs that the crop image is showing, a serverless \"function-as-a-service\" can provide that capacity for a developer.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/bm6jwodptjw61.png?width=1360&format=png&auto=webp&s=29a9e9552a1f3874b8932e5baaabe5bf91c8fccd\n\nThat image is stored with the provider to improve the quality of future recommendations and output as well. Given that the image taker is likely situated in a rural area, edge computing like this allows the application to complete this process much faster than communicating to a central server that is in a much farther location.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Functions as a service](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/1trzui6ctjw61.png?width=670&format=png&auto=webp&s=5501fee8d2a9a8e2e5bce681a6b86d6f48e69da3)\n\n2. It allows developers to spend more time working on application code rather than infrastructure tosupport it.\n\nImagine that a product that benefits off real-time services and events has particular problems handling the amount of traffic that reaches their servers. A perfect example of this are the server failures of Rob-in-the-hood during spikes of activity or Reddit's own ability to handle surges of logins, registrations, and activity after events like GME's stock market explosion. Other historical problems were things like World of Warcraft's expansion releases, where servers were effectively \"on fire\" and required round-the-clock support.\n\nEdge computing effectively offloads some of these problems from central servers by making the network more programmable and effective. If an application I wrote suddenly has to manage 1,000,000 users, a serverless architecture allows for intelligent \"autoscaling\" - which means that services like Fastly will handle those problems for me. This ultimately results in a metered pay-as-you-go system.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The network as a utility](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/hq7l51wwtjw61.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=c1f88e8d28b452a5bf0a7d0c560e22e8b2ba0f7a)\n\nThe combination of these two benefits is pretty powerful, allowing a developer to essentially start up an idea from application to deployment at a much faster pace. I believe this should equip a reader with the ability to imagine the opportunity behind edge and serverless computing. Here are some simple questions I like to think about:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[we've all been there.](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ydk0hfx7ujw61.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c506b4d99dfd7e7f512f9d304f5c1e8f53e52e9)\n\n\\- Can we improve the customer experience of swiping a card in a store or other network based currencies?\n\n\\- How do we improve the security of individual network-connected devices?\n\n\\- Are we able to improve the response times of emergency technologies like hospital or firefight dispatching?\n\n\\- Are we able to better measure online engagement and create new interactive experiences?\n\n\\- Will online video games require servers bounded by location?\n\n\\- Would we be able to change camera angles when watching a sports stream?\n\n\\- Can we improve the quality of industrial automation or logistics?\n\n\\- Are we able to extend programmability to \"node\" based products like windmill farms or electric vehicle charging stations?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ \ud83d\ude80](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/5otn5vekvjw61.png?width=2230&format=png&auto=webp&s=14201da0292e3f895dc829239999889d0af43add)\n\nSome of these questions are asked by Fastly themselves, as they list the following subjects of interest in their S-1:\n\n1. **API acceleration**. Accelerate and secure critical API responses at the edge for delightful application experiences, such as instant hotel lookup based on location and real-time inventory updates between retail stores and their online storefronts;\n2. **IoT**. Process and secure data from connected devices at the edge for instant results for time-sensitive applications;\n3. **Cloud migration**. Seamlessly migrate from data center to cloud, hybrid or multi-cloud environments, enabling the customer to take advantage of the functionality and cost savings of one or more cloud providers\n4. **Enabling redactedchain (block)**. Cache and accelerate individual transactions on the redactedchain (block) in real time.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nTL;DR Investing in some form of serverless computing is a good idea.\n\nYou may have noticed that I did not discuss financials. This is mostly because these details do not nearly weigh as much as the general understanding of the product, which is content-delivery and serverless computing. In my view, the economic consequence of these architectures far outweighs any other metric that could measure the future value of a company like Fastly. Most of my DD writing follows this principal; I'm far more focused on economic consequences and incentives of an industry player rather than data-points that can be fixed in time like a recent earnings or financial report. Those things need to just check out.","238":"I analyze mentions and sentiment of stocks across Reddit and Twitter! This week's most discussed and top growing stocks! This post is in continuation of a series of posts I made in the previous weeks. The response I received was amazing and lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. So here goes!\n\n**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/tymisf4seiw61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=1aa1cef4c9a92f4863d89db376e4b86acf9380c9\n\n Microvision has overtaken GME to become the most discussed stock. This is the first time since Jan\u201921 that any stock has overtaken GME in the number of mentions (Not even the $100B Coinbase IPO could do it). Clover health has fallen from 3rd position last week to 7th this week. Coinbase also dropped out of the top 10 and is now in the 12th position. All the others are the usual stocks in the top 10 list except for Microsoft. They booked their biggest revenue growth since 2018 but down 3%+ after hours. \n\n **Top Growing Stocks of the Week** \n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/obttnaoueiw61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8e0b1a918c030d69646aa7f4915def8c13f1007\n\n Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media.\n\n**MicroVision ($MVIS)** has been trending for the last two weeks. To say that the stock had a wild ride for the last 2 weeks would be an understatement. The stock went from having less than 500 mentions to more than 15,000 mentions in the last 2 weeks. The sentiment has also been affected by the recent drop going from 24% last week to 15% this week.\n\n**Globalstar ($GSAT)** is a Mobile satellite service company incorporating themselves into many new areas. GSAT was up 50% on Monday causing the spike in chatter. There has been a lot of discussion on the company trading at a value less than what their satellites currently in orbit are worth.\n\n**Nokia($NOK)** has beaten all expectations in earnings report and the stock jumped 11%. Their net profit increased more than 11-fold to 375 million euros ($455 million) which was well above analysts' estimates for adjusted profit of 90 million euros. The extremely bullish outlook is also reflected in the sentiment figures.\n\n**Ocugen($OCGN)** was trending mainly due to their partnership with an Indian firm \u2013 Bharat Biotech which produces Covaxin. The vaccine was found to neutralize a new type of Covid-19 variant and Dr. Fauci has said that this might be very important against the current pandemic. Ocugen is planning to bring this COVID-19 vaccine to the US, pending FDA authorization.\n\n**Amazon($AMZN)** was generating discussions due to its pending earnings report. There was a lot of speculative talk about a stock split. But they delivered beats on overall revenue and AWS revenue and far exceeded EPS estimate for Q1 2021.\n\n**SOME FAQ\u2019s:**\n\nHow does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about the stock is positive or negative).\n\nCan I use the code\/is it open source: Yes.\n\nWhat is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here is the average across all the comments.\n\nThank you for reading!\n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor.*","239":"OCUGEN DD India COVAXIN This stock's COVID vaccine product is breaking news in India, one of the biggest stock trading countries in the world and with the biggest population in the world. If they decide to buy the COVAXIN from OCUGEN, we will see the likes of another GME born before our eyes.\n\n[https:\/\/timesofindia.indiatimes.com\/city\/pune\/covaxin-stirs-nearly-recovery-level-antibodies\/articleshow\/82235989.cms](https:\/\/timesofindia.indiatimes.com\/city\/pune\/covaxin-stirs-nearly-recovery-level-antibodies\/articleshow\/82235989.cms)\n\nYou can read this vaccine all over mainstream media, the news, and what's most important is in India, they may be on the verge to accept this vaccine for distribution because of the huge amount of cases of COVID still ongoing rampaging their country.\n\n President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. Call with Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India outlined how the two countries can cooperate and work together to fight this pandemic. The main thing was that Prime Minister Modi is very excited to start the emergency distribution of COVAXIN which has 100% efficacy compared to the ones currently being used in India. \n\n[https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/briefing-room\/statements-releases\/2021\/04\/26\/readout-of-president-joseph-r-biden-jr-call-with-prime-minister-narendra-modi-of-india-2\/](https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/briefing-room\/statements-releases\/2021\/04\/26\/readout-of-president-joseph-r-biden-jr-call-with-prime-minister-narendra-modi-of-india-2\/)\n\nThis is all very very very exciting news for holders of OCGN, and look at the asking price. It's fairly low for a company who may be the next Pfizer, Moderna, JJ. The stock rose 20% today but that is still a far too low price point for what I expect for this stock. GME rose easily 50% a day ongoing for many days.\n\nNot financial advice, do you own DD, there is alot of DD out on this right now.\n\nPrice Point: $30","240":"$TAP Miller-Coors: A company that has re-invented itself and wallstreet is sleeping Alright retards, here\u2019s a DD that contains no technical analysis because if this company had good technical\u2019s it wouldn\u2019t be a sleeper. This is a social arbitrage DD. Also, I don't care about how many micro-brews you have in your town. Beer is somewhat irrelevant to this play.\n\nMolson-Coors is no longer the piss beer coors brand that your drunk uncle remembers. It\u2019s now a company that\u2019s woken up from the dead with new leadership and rollout of fantastic products. They have focused on a completely new product lineup, that involves seltzers, energy drinks, THC beverage\u2019s, and a \"beyond beer\" segment. Couple all these new products with the lockdowns ending globally and you are going to have a monster Q2\/Q3 earnings report. Not to mention this stock is beat down so much from wall street it\u2019s a asymmetric trade as it stands right now.\n\nFirst off, wall street fucking hates this company and for good reason. The past 7 years they were stagnant and failed to adapt to new markets\/trends. They took on billions of debt to purchase SABmiller. Another shit beer company that wasn\u2019t doing shit. The beauty of this is that wall street is frozen and is going to be late to the party when they get smacked in the dick with earnings for Q2 and Q3 of this year. They have a wait and see attitude to towards this company and they will be forced to pile on once they see the results from the new products molson-coors has deployed.\n\nTo name a few:\n\n* Topo Chico Hard Seltzer: Owned by coke but Molson- coors has exclusive manufacturing, distribution and marketing rights. This new seltzer is the hotness on the streets right now. It had a soft launch 3 weeks ago in 9 states and it already has over 3% of the seltzer market. Go out and pick some up(if its not sold out everywhere) and I promise you you\u2019ll be throwing your life savings into this company on Monday morning.\n* Zoa: New energy drink from the Rock. Who knows how this is going to sell but with the Rock pushing this to his tens of millions of social media followers, im sure it\u2019ll do just fine. I've spoken to a health store(cant name it here because of the automods) rep who have said this is selling as well as redbull and monster.\n* Light Sky: One of the best if not best light beers out there. Its blue moons light offering. Go check it out, it\u2019s a crushable summer beer. Perhaps the best light beer on the market right now.\n* Yuengling: Signed distribution rights to expand the company to the West Coast.\n* Vizzy Hard Seltzer: Another new solid seltzer offering. Has vitamin-c and shit that all the crunchies like. Also has great taste and flavors.\n* Coors Seltzer: Not sure who buys this but I heard its selling really well. Just glad the company has many different seltzer offerings now.\n* Truss Beverage: THC infused beverage offering that\u2019s killing it in Canada and has plans to expand to the US soon. This is going to be the market leader in the THC industry. It it universally the favorite in Canada. \n* [Beyond beer hub](https:\/\/www.beveragedaily.com\/Article\/2021\/04\/08\/Molson-Coors-launches-Beverage-Hub-for-beyond-beer-beverages): This is super exciting. Molson-coors has been bleeding out the past 10 years because they failed to adapt to new and emerging markets. This endeavor will enable them to be on the cutting edge of any trend that is emerging. Just think, if this company got into seltzers when it was starting to materialize 4 years ago, the stock prices would be well over $100\/share minimum. With this hub you can be sure that Molson-Coors will never miss an opportunity like that again.\n\nThe Selzer game is absolutely huge for this company. This is a main pillar of the company\u2019s revitalization. The seltzer market is doubling every year and theres projections TAP will take a minimum of 10-15% of the market with Topo Chico and Vizzy alone. That is hundreds of millions to billions in revenue for a company that only has a 10B market cap. This can easily drive this stock price up by multiples.\n\nCheck out this quote from an insider: \u201cJust talked with a 10 year brewer in Milwaukee with coors- moors, extremely bullish conversation overall. Coors seltzer is see high sell through, heard vizzy is selling well, he brews light sky and blue moon, said sell through has been amazing, told me the company acquired\/did a deal with columbay(?) For a hard coffee drink, he raved about the sampler packs they got, and extremely good initial response from that, rolling that out soon but didn\u2019t know timeline, he\u2019s heard topo is flying, the whole company is buzzing, but didn\u2019t know much beyond that. Said his factory laid 200 people off start of 2020, and have now hired back 350. He was extremely enthusiastic. Overall said in his ten years he\u2019s never seen coors do so well. Very confident in management and direction\u201d.\n\nAll of these solid new product additions coupled with the US coming out of lockdown and they are going to blow the tits off earnings Q2 and Q3. I expect the earnings call this week to be terrible for Q1 due to lockdowns and a cyber attack that stalled beverage production. Good time to jump in.\n\nTLDR: Revitalized company with new leadership, fantastic new diverse product offerings coupled with ending lockdowns will be rocket fuel for this company. Q1 earnings will suck because of the lockdowns and cyber-attack disrupting production but Q2 and Q3 will blow the tits off wallstreet. In my opinion the Q1 report will give us all a solid price to buy in. $SAM 6X in 3 years and I expect similar performance or better here. The stock is so beaten down from the past 5 years it's a safe asymmetric play with incredible upside potential. Even Michael Burry owns this. But he'll probably sell out before it rockets like GameStop because he's a boomer.\n\nMy Position: 20 $47C Oct '21, 30 $70C Jan '22, and 769 Shares(Buying after earnings 5\/29)","241":"Short Sellers Never Learn - They're Doubling Down on CLOV (DD) At this point, seems a lot of people know about CLOV. Just so happens that the catalyst was a data error, but the opportunity is still quite strong even though the short interest isn't 144% of float. After all, it's now estimated at over 43%, making CLOV still one of the most shorted stocks in the entire market (if not THE most shorted stock).\n\nNow, I actually bought into this at $7 several weeks ago. I first became aware of CLOV in the midst of the January hype, but I don't like buying high, so I stayed away. Came back a few weeks later and started watching for bullish signs as it dropped, saw that sweeeet solid bounce happening after tapping $6.50, and bought in around $7 myself.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/5v5jbsepycu61.png?width=1196&format=png&auto=webp&s=8804c928fbb1e9bcff4269a4808a906c2ff376bb\n\nA few reasons for this initial bullishness from that point:\n\n* I think the \"DOJ Investigation\" accusations are a bunch of hogwash and were causing a temporary and factually empty hammering of the stock.\n* The average price target among analysts was at something like $13.50 at the time, with no analysts labeling it a sell. That is super promising for long-term holds.\n* The market opportunity itself. CLOV is one of those \"will make it big or will die trying\" kind of stocks. I think they can make it in the space, but it's uncertain enough to give fuel to detractors, keeping the price down until their results start showing.\n* The continued support shown around $7 weeks later just confirmed my bias, so I was watching closely to add to my position at the first sign of bullishness.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ebpjsdb00du61.png?width=198&format=png&auto=webp&s=f114a359f0333b9f693cdcffefe1aee139e748d1\n\nNeedless to say, seemed like a home run, a nice value opportunity for a long-term hold. Then, I became aware of the short interest.\n\nFriday I saw my position exploding and had to look into why. Saw the 144% short interest report and increased my position by like 10x. This was no longer just a buy and hold for a high long-term gain, but could really explode up quickly! Turns out, the short interest wasn't quite accurate. But, ironically, this inaccurate short interest report actually did result from CLOV going from a top 10 short interest stock to quite possibly THE most shorted stock on the market in terms of float. Here's where it stands now according to Ortex. \n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/g7oobj1tqdu61.png?width=331&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa2960f93772aaee400260dc35a6fcd12df4da54\n\nWith a 90% util rate, just about every share even available to be lent for shorts is taken up at this point. Shorts have basically maxed out their position, making up about 43% of the technical float. \n\nHowever, a large portion of the float is not actually \"available\". Given the information available on their most recent 10-K, it appears that roughly 87 million shares are owned by insiders\/controlling investors. This leaves less than 60 million shares actually available for the \"real\" available float. This is likely why the util rate is at 90% despite less than half of the shares being on loan. We're at an \"effective\" short interest of roughly 75% and rising.\n\nY'all, I liked this stock before this whole thing, but now I love it. This is a pretty unique opportunity to squeeze some shorts. I don't want to say it's the \"next GME\", because obviously GME actually was shorted all the way past 100% of float and was a turnaround story itself. GME also took a super long time to actually take off and make that squeeze happen. I was in GME in Feb and March of 2020 and actually had sadly taken out my money when the stock hit like $24 in Dec (I never imagined it might go into the $40s, much less $400+).\n\nI don't see this as a \"turnaround story\" so much as a stock that has been massively underestimated by the market due to some hammering of Chamath and general SPAC distaste. For me, this is a value play that's been enhanced by the potential for a pretty massive short squeeze.\n\nFull disclosure, I currently hold:\n\n* 300 shares\n* One 21 May 7.5 C\n* One 18 Jun 7 C\n* One 20 Aug 12.5 C\n\nI'm also waiting on a deposit to clear, with which I plan to purchase a LEAP. I may roll my May call into something with a later expiry as well given how hard it can be to time these things.\n\nP.S. To top it all off, I'm a giant fan of the Wyckoff Method.

To sum that up: FactSet (top financial data provider) had the CLOV float listed as 23.5M and short interest at 39M - putting the percentage of the float shorted at 146.6%. This circulated online and has been argued on twitter and reddit starting Friday. Factset has since updated the float to 109.8M making the 39M short interest account for 36% of the float. They previously had deducted the CEO\u2019s class B shares from the total class A shares, and although his shares are \u201cnon-tradeable\u201d and shouldn't be included in the public float, they were only using the class A shares to determine the float as all class B shares are already non-tradeable unless converted - so shouldn\u2019t have been part of the equation to begin with. Now I could get more into the \"Hindenberg said this\u201d and \u201cS3 said this\u201d bullshit that people have been arguing about...\n\nBut heres why NONE OF THAT EVEN FUCKING MATTERS\n\nShorts and those who have been bashing CLOV and arguing against the original short float number are taking a victory lap, like Factset updating the short float to 36% destroys the entire bullish case for CLOV and now it will tank. BULLSHIT, here\u2019s why:\n\nThe 39M short interest number being used in the short float calculation is from 3\/31. Over two weeks ago. When the two highest volume and highest short volume days in CLOV history have occurred within the last two weeks. With \\~30M short volume on 4\/8 and \\~90M short volume on Friday (according to Fintel). We don\u2019t know at this time how much of the short volume is covered and would be included in the current short interest; but given all this, you could logically conclude the short float on CLOV right now could be pretty damn high. For context, 36% short float - based on outdated short interest from 3\/31 - is in the ballpark of double what we're currently seeing in GME or AMC, and would still make CLOV one of the highest short float stocks in the entire market right now.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/rvr4bslwszt61.png?width=1242&format=png&auto=webp&s=801f7c4f339e3573272d280586c7a9bd54d8343d\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/l4ssab8yszt61.png?width=2010&format=png&auto=webp&s=10de1da2465f375d84f5d28bdf9689936cf5af48\n\nThe short float is only a small piece of the puzzle, and it\u2019s without a doubt high enough to trigger a short squeeze if price continues to rise, end of story. Now let\u2019s get into the shit that really matters.\n\nFirst off, from a technical perspective, there are some good signs. (if you hate technical analysis or think you're so good at it that you'll find a way to disagree with whatever I say then skip to the next section)\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/06weuky6tzt61.png?width=1125&format=png&auto=webp&s=64b8a0b9d28d85d079627746c4e1832aec8f153e\n\n* MACD bullish\n* RSI only starting to warm up\n* Decent support built between $7-$7.30\n* But what\u2019s really screaming on this chart are these two recent MASSIVE buying volume days coming after about a month of consolidation with a double bottom pattern making higher lows.\n\n**Now let\u2019s get into call volume**\n\n[Some of the order that came through Friday](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ksveumt0tzt61.png?width=1108&format=png&auto=webp&s=2577d77bf9ab0d6f3180c955e9af5b861f859f3b)\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/a7e1pes3tzt61.png?width=730&format=png&auto=webp&s=83c9ea5a0d92808cfd65626f792fa1078443b1ed\n\nFridays call flow and the sheer volume and open interest on some of these call options speak for themselves. This is where I should break down the mechanics of a gamma squeeze, but really all you need to know is that heavy call volume is important for two reasons: 1) it can be a good indicator of where money is flowing in the market and 2) the people who write the call options need to buy shares to hedge against their position. The more the price rises the more shares they need to buy, helping to push price higher just like we see in a short squeeze.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNext, CLOV is down over 50% from Dec\/Jan highs. Some of the main reasons for the drop would be:\n\n* Money flowing out of growth stocks and SPACS\n* Hindenberg short report\n* Short seller price manipulation\n\nThe Hindenburg short attack really did a number on CLOV. The stock was trading at about $14 prior to the release of their short report and dropped over 50% in the weeks following its release.\n\nHindenburg attacked CLOV from many different angles. One of their main arguments being that Clover Health uses misleading and unethical marketing practices to boost sales, as evidence stating that in 2016: \u201cClover was fined for misleading marketing practices by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)\u201d\n\nWell, just this month (April 8th), the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services granted Clover heath approval in 10 new states. CLOV has yet to release a PR on this but it has been updated on the CMS website (see picture below). The stock price jumped with huge volume on this news but short sellers were able to manipulate it back down until the spike we just saw on Friday.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/sc2w81eatzt61.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=7eb791918794ff6a425e42fffa397e409788b782\n\nIt seems that Hindenbergs argument doesn\u2019t hold up as the same federal agency (CMS) they were using to support claims against Clover Health is currently supporting Clovers expansion into 10 new states. Which is huge news for CLOV by the way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Wrapping this up**\n\nNow say what you will about Chamath, but he had retail investors back during the GME squeeze. He promoted it, posted his personal positions, and while Wall Street, CNBC, and others attacked Gamestop, Chamath defended retail traders and the movement as a whole. It may be a total coincidence that his SPAC\u2019s were the target of short attacks shortly after, but his support of the GME squeeze may have made him a bigger target.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo one knows what will happen in the market, I sure as hell don\u2019t, but given all that's been laid out here, I like the stock.\n\n$CLOV to $30\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso: this is not financial advice, do your own DD blah blah blah\n\nAnd for those asking about my position. I'm looking to add shares and calls Monday and\/or throughout the week based on the price action and within my own personal risk tolerance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Update 4\/20:** people asking if they should sell. You shouldn't be trading if you need someone to tell you.","244":"Extremely thorough CLOV recent action DD I\u2019m going to go back a little bit in time and tell you how CLOV was directly related to GME squeeze.\nSo when GME was squeezing two very influential people have backed the squeeze and caused it to squeeze even more. Those two people were Elon Musk and Chamath Palihapitiya. Both partners in previous endeavors and friends. \nGME squeeze hurt short seller Hindenburg so much that they have lost 40% of their account that week. \nCLOV is backed by Chamath Palihapitiya. Hindenburg, in order to retaliate at Chamath for causing them huge losses, published a short seller report for CLOV few days after Chamath tweeted about GME. Short seller report had very little base, yet that caused the stock to drop and also SEC had to initiate an investigation due to the claims. \nSince then stock got beaten down to less than IPO prices. What does that mean? It means that it was moved not so much by true owners of the stock, but mostly by short sellers. That will play in nicely in the squeeze because short sellers always have to close out, but if stock is still held by their true purchasers it means that there are even less shares available for active trading. \n\n\n\nEnough of history. Retail following:\n\nSince GME endeavor Chamath PAlihapitiya joined the club of \u201cretail gods\u201d.... he is one of the poster babies for retail movement on hurting short sellers. His previous partnerships with Elon Musk furthers retail following so now not only we have GME crowd supporting Chamath, but also Tesla crowd. Both of those stocks were some of the most successful trades in history. \n\n\n\nFriday\u2019s Hindenburg\u2019s fright with CLOV:\n\nOn Friday CLOV has opened with 148% short interest and after this was noticed by retail the squeeze has started. The volume topped 250M shares traded (10x average daily volume and 5x its previous heaviest volume day). (Ill get in to more technicals later, but needed to mention this to push the narrative).\nHindenburg saw the action and protecting their possible short position tweeted that FactSet has misleading short interest data about CLOV not including CEOs clad B shares in the float. \nFactSet came back to Hindenburg\u2019s allegations with a reply that CEOs type B shares are classified as not tradable and are not included in the float. And once again confirmed that stock is 148% short.\nThis further angered retail traders and a lot of chatter online has started how Hindenburg is trying to manipulate this stock with lies and deceit. \nA lot of people didn\u2019t catch on on Friday but through the night and this afternoon Reddit and stock twits seem to have exploded about it, videos are popping up on YouTube. A lot of traction is being created over the weekend for a sweet Monday open. \n\n\n\nTechnicals:\n*CLOV free float is 109mil \n*CLOV shares outstanding are 406mil\n*78% of CLOV shares are owed by insiders and are still locked up. Insiders are only allowed to sell if stock hits $30 and stays above $30 for 90 days \n*institutional ownership of CLOV is at 48%\n\n*the volume on Friday was 249mil shares which only represents 61% turn over for shares outstanding, but if you take locked up shares out of consideration, true turn over was actually 228%, meaning every share available to trade was bought and sold at least twice on Friday. \n\nA lot of people that bought on Friday (including NEXT financial group that bought 21,400 shares) will not likely be actively trading this week meaning available shares short term will continue on decreasing.\n\nIn my speculation out of 109 mil free float Only around 35% of shares will be available to trade this week. Here is how I got to this number: \n-institutions owe 48% of stock and they are not likely to trade short term fluctuations, but giving it a benefit of doubt let\u2019s say that institutions that will hold account only to 30% of float. Now we only have 70% of float left to trade....\n-let\u2019s assume that investors that owe CLOV long term account for 20% of the float. A lot of them don\u2019t check stocks daily or sometimes even weekly. Let\u2019s assume that half of them even won\u2019t notice what is happening this week. At this point we only have 50% of float left to trade. \n-the rest of the free float is being traded by scalpers\/ day traders, swing traders and \u201cdiamond handers\u201d. This is a very educated group and unless scalping or pattern trading will understand that we are in the middle of the squeeze and hold. I believe this group will contribute to another 15% of float being unavailable, assuming half of them will be trading fluctuations and half holding. \nSo my conclusion is: only 35% of available shares will be circulating next week being sold and bought over and over again. That\u2019s only 38mil shares not being stuck in someone\u2019s account semi permanently. Some more liquidity will be provided short term by other shorters flocking in, but I won\u2019t take them in consideration because they too have to close out at some point. \n\nFallowing all this speculative, yet very carefully vetted math let\u2019s calculate the demand for the shares, just to close short positions\n-148% of the free float is shorted, meaning 161mil shares will be in demand just to close out short positions. Since we already established that there will be only 38mil shares freely circulating in the market each short share will only have 0.24 shares. So looks like there are 4 times less shares than demand to close short positions! Throw in some buying activity to that math and you have a number closer to 10:1. \n\nFollowing all of that the question is how far the stock can go during this particular squeeze? Well the answer is: it\u2019s mathematically impossible to calculate. Although there are some indicators of what people can expect. Smaller the float, the bigger the short interest and the heavier the volume the further it can go. In this particular instance we have the combination of all three factors. Even if it\u2019s impossible to predict exactly what price short squeeze will hit, it\u2019s possible to trade short squeeze well using technical indicators and trade management. Monitoring volume, daily short interest and days to cover should be adequate. To know when short squeeze is ending I monitor same indicators that made me spot the short squeeze to start with, but in reverse. Meaning volume will start to tapper off, short percentage decrease and the upwards momentum will start to whilt. I also watch out for extremely sudden, needle like falls (trailing stop loss domino effect). \n\nI hope the read was interesting and I haven\u2019t lost you half way through. \n\nI won\u2019t go into any CLOV fundamentals or any of that good stuff cause I think we already established that everything is in order there. It is also completely irrelevant in a mathematical squeeze.","245":"The Lucky Clover \ud83c\udf40 Edit: There have been multiple observations about $CLOV true short interest (different numbers from FactSet, S3 Partners, Bloomberg). As it's always the case, there is a lot of noise and the numbers I have are not watertight, so you should do your own work. What seems to hold though, is that $CLOV has been agressively beaten down by bears.\n\nEdit2: Have rolled my calls to July \/ Aug dates. \n\nTL;DR  \ud83c\udf40 go brrrrr \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nHowdy degenerates!\n\nI bet you saw the price action in $CLOV yesterday (+20%)? Turns out the shorts got greedy again -- close to 120% greedy.\n\nWhat??? Haven't they learnt their lesson with $GME at once? Apparently not. The $GME squeeze has cost a bunch of hedge funds (Melvin, Maplelane, D1) billions in losses on top of their damaged reputation and 'prestige'.\n\nThese hedge funds hold a lot of grudge towards a few people that chipped in during the $GME squeeze of January 2021 -- namely Chamath. See excerpt from Greenlight Capital (David Einhorn's hedge fund) letter:\n\n[Einhorn's April 15 letter to investors](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/f54gnkshapt61.png?width=1254&format=png&auto=webp&s=f408458520ba063250597ad9c2e270e73eddfb75)\n\nTheir weapon of choice -- shorting $CLOV, which was SPACed by Chamath.\n\nIsn\u2019t $CLOV a pos stock? No, and even if it is, this is irrelevant. As you already figured it out, most short squeezes are mostly math, however this may or may not unfold.\n\n**$CLOV Short Interest:**\n\n$CLOV has 118% short interest. Shorts will try an tell you that this is much lower. In fact that's exactly what Hindenburg tried to do yesterday. Hindenburg even e-mailed FactSet to counter S3 Partners data (although S3 calculation also seems to be incorrect). The table below is based on Clover's 10K + latest 13G filed by Vanguard, so should be very close to reality:\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/osbjmrweapt61.png?width=1324&format=png&auto=webp&s=77d1b36c6532e3d7e569cec2021a3fc7de03b37e\n\n[This includes CEO's shares in the float -- it shouldn't. ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ypfw5kulapt61.png?width=862&format=png&auto=webp&s=49333325388e5108d6af6c4b6d5b9b15c797c210)\n\nShorts are intentionally including CEO's shares into the float to make it appear larger. This is boneheaded at best and intentionally deceitful at worst:\n\n* The CEO (Vivek Garipalli) is the founder of $CLOV; the likelihood of him selling his shares is close to nil\n* All his shares are Class B (10-to-1 voting ratio vs. Class A; only Class A shares are traded on the open market -- so they shouldn't be in the calculation in the first place), which means that if he sells or transfers his shares this will generally result in those shares converting to Class A (i.e. losing the supervoting feature)\n* Even if he would decide to sell, the shares are still locked-up until July\n* Management incentive plan is anchored at $30 per share. What this means is that the share price has to exceed $30 for 90 consecutive days in order for management plan RSUs to vest and be possible to sell\n\n***What does this mean?***\n\nWhat this means is that a very small amount of $CLOV shares are free to trade because \\~78% of the shares are still owned by insiders, locked-up and not trading. It only takes a little bit of gamma fairy dust to make $CLOV move A LOT.\n\n**Timing:**\n\nTiming this is tricky. $CLOV is due to announce results on May 20th, so save for any good news, this would be our catalyst.\n\nTo capture the biggest upside, the highest strike call options are the best for this. Currently the only May expiry options are 5\/21 $30C (still cheap at $0.2).

Fidelity sold in January.  Instead the position of Black Rock Inc which owns 9,217,335 is confirmed. The other Black Rock Fund Advisors which owns 10m shares is wrong.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR's TLDR: The finra data are completely wrong and are not to be taken into account","247":"Quick DD on SunPower Corporation (SPWR)... highly shorted green energy company of interest I've done a bit of research on the [upcoming rebalance for Black Rock's green energy funds](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/thecorporation\/comments\/mm5cdo\/blackrockageddon_2_further_thoughts_and_work_on\/). As seen in the link, 60-odd energy stocks are being added to the fund, at the expense of the existing larger stakes (looking at you, PLUG). \n\n.\n\nWhile NEE is the little darling of the change, SunPower Corporation is on the short list of recommended adds. This is interesting, because SPWR is also on the *other* short list... [the list of highly shorted companies](https:\/\/www.highshortinterest.com\/). SPWR at the time of this writing is over 22% short floated (GME is 24%), and I show -11% short float from the previous month. I'm surprised it's still this high, because the impending rebalance would buy a lot of shares, raising the price. Price goes up, shorts have to exit, things get squeezy. \n\n.\n\nThis is where I like to hope that some intern at one of these hedge funds is reading this post and going to get his boss. If WSB is aware of the potential squeeze, as well as the potential BlackRock buy, there are $600 million in shorts that need to make their way to the door ASAP. I'm not going to say this is Gamestop... we're not at $5... but the current suppressed price is $29.9, and the 3 week high is $35. Just removing the short pressure could get that back, even without the BlackRock buying. I like to hope just the potential of BlackRock's buy will take it that high, but WSB taking note might have a strong incentive effect on hedge fund rectal clenching and take it higher.\n\n.\n\nFundamentally, SPWR is a semiconductor company, P\/E ratio is 8.4 (well below semiconductor industry average 25.2), and profits are in a bit of a slump, which should pick up with the green push by the US Government. My interest is in the good price, the heavy short load, and the potential to squeeze. If Blackrock announces the stock in its ETFs, I expect a very nice rise.\n\n.\n\ntl;dr: SPWR is highly shorted and may join Blackrock ETFs. Hedge funds fear the ape. This makes for delicious banana.","248":"GME Megathread for April 08, 2021 Holy moly!\n\n[Ryan Cohen to Become Chairman of the Board Following Annual Meeting](https:\/\/investor.gamestop.com\/news-releases\/news-release-details\/gamestop-announces-slate-director-candidates-2021-annual-meeting)","249":"Key differences between RKT and ASO I''m seeing a lot of posts on ASO, with some of them comparing to the RKT situation in early March. I want to clarify a few key differences here. This post is NOT saying ASO is a bad investment, I'm sure their excellent earnings indicate that their business is going strong. I'm only trying to show that, in my opinion, a RKT-like gamma squeeze is *unlikely*.\n\nSo first thing, we have to understand that the RKT squeeze is primarily a gamma squeeze - the price blew up 20% initially, getting close to the highest strikes available at the time, and then steadily grew to over 70% over the course of the day. If you look at the share cost distribution (below), you will notice a big block between \\~$28 to \\~$40. I've been tracking this since the squeeze and it has not changed. What happened was that institutions were selling naked calls (because RKT was trading flat forever before the spike), and they were forced to buy shares to hedge, creating a gamma squeeze. Institutional holdings recorded at the end of dec was about 74%, suggesting that there could have been a good number of exposed naked calls. If it were primarily driven by a short squeeze, this big block would not exist.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/7x37a6m7olr61.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=18a030afd647c5d87ef3fff2f618483452de072d\n\nOn the other hand, what is ASO's situation? ASO has 91.6% institutional ownership. I would suspect most of the calls that are sold are already covered. ASO has been trending up since its IPO anyways so there wouldn't be as many naked thetagang as RKT before the spike. Thus, I highly doubt a gamma squeeze can happen. What about a short squeeze? Of course this can happen as the short interest is high, but unless millions of apes jump in like GME (unlikely since they are already in GME) or a whale buys in (also highly highly unlikely). The high institutional ownership also means that lots of shares will be available to be lent out, and shorts will have a hell of a time if any spike happens.\n\nWith this in mind, investors in ASO should tread lightly. I would probably suggest getting shares if you are bullish and not options.","250":"Tried to post ASO DD this weekend but it got autofiltered. So, here it is if you are still interested! By now you have likely seen some $ASO talk. There are some other really good DD posts in WSB that cover different aspects of the stock. This post will break down why I'm bullish AF on ASO and why I believe that it could hit $60 or higher in the next few weeks. Before GME gang jumps down my throat, don't worry, I am still hodling. There are other stocks to make money on while that one consolidates and trades sideways for a little while. \n \n&nbsp;\n\n**TL;DR**: ASO looks a lot like RKT did in February when there was a massive spike. Short interest is high (may be over 45%) on a stock that has been steadily rising since its IPO in late 2020. They beat earnings expectations in a similar fashion to RKT (1.09 actual vs. 0.62 expected EPS = 76% beat). Undervalued stock that is primed for a squeeze means bears r fuk. \n \n&nbsp;\n  \nOk, for those of you apes with a few wrinkles, I will explain why you might be able to take your wife and her boyfriend and her parents to Red Lobster and order more than water and biscuits. \n \n&nbsp;\n \n**2021 is the year of the squeezes and the SI% on this bad boy is HIGH**\n \n&nbsp;\n \nHedgies have shorted a wide swath of the market, with a focus on retailers. Makes sense, right? The pandemic has hit a lot of retailers hard, forcing a lot of store closures. Academy Sports & Outdoors has been able to thrive through the pandemic for a few reasons: \n \n1. Their stores are mainly located in southern states whose COVID restrictions are far more lax than their northern counterparts. \n  \n2. Guns and ammo. There has been a massive pullback on offering guns and ammo by big box retailers due to a shift in public sentiment due to mass shootings. However, thanks to the pandemic and civil unrest, more people are buying guns than ever. ASO has not curtailed their gun and ammo offerings, which are a recession-proof sales channel right next to liquor.  \n \n&nbsp;\n\n \nRetailers have been shorted massively (see GME) with the shorts expecting that retail will die with the rise of online sales. Maybe they are right in the long term, but for now, people are still going to stores. Here in GA, you wouldn't know there is a pandemic if people weren't wearing masks. The mall parking lots are full. The short interest on ASO was 45.21% on 3\/15 according to TD Ameritrade (compare that to 36.6% on RKT in late February). The stock is up 147% since its IPO in October 2020 without any significant dips, which tells us one thing: none of the shorts are in the money.  I first took interest in ASO about a month ago when I saw them at the top of the shorted list. Investing in stocks in January that had high short interest was quite lucrative for me, so I've been trying to continue investing in shorted stocks that appear to have a bright future. Because bears r fuk and squeezes are fun. \n   \n&nbsp;\n\nLet's look at the short interest over time for ASO: \n \n&nbsp;\n\n|Report Date|Total Shares Sold Short|Dollar Volume Sold Short|Change from Previous Report|Percentage of Float Shorted|Days to Cover|Price on Report Date|\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n|3\/15\/2021|12,510,000 shares|$308.37 million|+0.8%|39.4%|9.1|$24.65|\n|2\/26\/2021|12,410,000 shares|$305.04 million|-3.0%|39.1%|8.3|$24.58|\n|2\/12\/2021|12,790,000 shares|$306.45 million|+24.5%|41.2%|8.9|$23.96|\n|1\/29\/2021|10,270,000 shares|$262.50 million|+10.1%|33.1%|7.3|$25.56|\n|1\/15\/2021|9,330,000 shares|$196.58 million|No Change|44.8%|8.4|$21.07|\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWe can see that short interest has increased over time up to a high here of 39.4% on 3\/15. TD Ameritrade says 45.21% and we know that short interest is not clear cut, so there is some variance on that  SI%. \n \n&nbsp;\n\nMost shares were shorted between $21 - $25 and were still shorted on 3\/15. What has happened to the price since 3\/15? It was driven down to a low of $23.19. As seen on [this chart](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/yrwzR6R.jpg). This means that most of the shorts did not become profitable during the biggest drop since the latest SI% report and likely did not cover. There was another seemingly artificial drop on 3\/31 down to $24.50 where some shorts may have covered which [I have put a little box around](https:\/\/imgur.com\/lss7ppj). Why do I say that it is an artificial drop? Because the company absolutely crushed earnings expectations and was trending up the day earnings were released. That premarket drop was clearly induced and may have been an opportunity for some of the shorts to cover with a small profit, but certainly not the majority. I believe SI% is still very high and there is a **squeeze to be squoze**. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nSome may attribute the drop in price on 3\/31 to the **IPO lockup expiration**. If you don't know what lockup expiration means, \n&nbsp;\n\n\n>When a company goes public through a traditional IPO, it usually sets a lock-up period of 90 to 180 days during which insiders can't sell their shares. That rule isn't mandated by the Securities and Exchange Commission -- it's a self-imposed one that prevents big investors from flooding the market with shares.\n&nbsp;\n\n\nSo, the lockup  expired and insiders can sell their shares, but why would they? They just beat earnings by a lot and should expect their shares to continue to increase in value. Also, there were further restrictions placed on insider sales that a commenter on another ASO DD thread made. I'm assuming it was valid research. Hopefully they can add it to this post because I don't have the full details, but essentially there is a still limit on how much the insiders can sell at one time as to no shift the price too much and that limit is 1% of the company's value. With a $2.64B market cap right now, that is $26.4M, or about 900,000 shares being the limit on insider sales in a day.  It is entirely possible that the lockup expiry was the cause of the 3\/31 drop, which would mean that it was not artificial and it was not a plan by shorts to cover. Meaning SI% is still in the 35-45% range. \n\n&nbsp;\n \n**THE STOCK IS UNDERVALUED**\n\n&nbsp;\n \n[According to Yahoo Finance](https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/results-academy-sports-outdoors-inc-052048433.html) the consensus price target is $32. [Simply Wall St](https:\/\/imgur.com\/Y95DfqK) has a fair value estimate of $49.99. Prior to the company beating EPS expectations by 76%, I was seeing discounted cash flow values of $35\/share. [GuruFocus has DCF value at $36.29](https:\/\/www.gurufocus.com\/stock\/ASO\/dcf). The price has been depressed. Watching the charts for the last month, there have been pretty massive sell walls in the $25 - $29 range, with order books full of those suspicious algorithm share #'s keeping the price from going up to its fair value naturally. With price targets that have not been fully updated for the earnings beat and increasing volume being between $28 - $35, it seems that the worst case scenario is buying in at $30 will net about a 10% gain or loss. That is attractive to boomers, which could increase retail volume.  \n \n&nbsp;\n\nDid someone say **volume**? Average volume was around 1.5M. Since earnings were released there has been an increase in volume: \n \n&nbsp;\n\n|Date|Volume|Over\/(Under) Average|\n--:|:--|:--|\n|26-Mar| 775,000| (725,000)|\n|29-Mar| 2,390,000| 890,000|\n|Earnings Release 30-Mar| 4,880,000| 3,380,000|\n|Lockup Expiry 31-Mar| 5,040,000| 3,540,000|\n|1-Apr| 3,610,000| 2,110,000|\n\n&nbsp;\n \nPrice at open on the day of earnings release was $24.98. It closed on 4\/1 at $29.01 for a 16% increase and kept going up after hours another $1 or another 4%. \n \n&nbsp;\n\nLet's see that in a table: \n\n|Date|Open|Close|% Change since earnings||\n:--|--:|--:|--:|:--|\n|26-Mar|23.92|24.59|||\n|29-Mar|24.98|24.23|-3.0%||\n|30-Mar|24.59|26.74|7.0%||\n|31-Mar|25.79|27.05|8.3%||\n|1-Apr|27.08|29.01|16.1%||\n|After Hours|29.01|30.00|20.1%||\n\n&nbsp;\n \nNow, I said previously that this stock reminds me of RKT. Strong earnings release for a heavily shorted stock and a delayed increase in price due to massive resistance. That resistance was overcome for RKT from massive buying volume as retail jumped on board. Volume really picked up and the RKT flew. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n \n|Date|Open|Close|% Change since earnings|\n--:|--:|--:|--:|\n|25-Feb|20.33|19.9|-2.1%|\n|26-Feb|23.33|21.85|7.5%|\n|1-Mar|23|24.3|19.5%|\n|2-Mar|27.34|41.6|104.6%|\n \n&nbsp;\n \nI'm not saying that ASO will have a 100% gain this week, but if you look at what's been happening in 2021 (RKT, AMC, Discovery?), when a stock gets attention and momentum with a high SI%, it is entirely possible to jump 100% in a day. ASO seems similar to RKT in terms of having low float, high short interest, consistently beating earnings, and absolute price. The price point is really important here. Most jabronis can afford to buy into a $30 stock. \n  \n&nbsp;\n\n**Indicators** \n \nI don't put a ton of faith in traditional indicators because we live in the Upside Down now, but MACD and RSI both look very promising, with MACD [on the 3-month chart](https:\/\/imgur.com\/unGgIgg) \"crossing over\" into positive territory on 3\/30. This is a bullish sign for the chart watchers. RSI on the daily, weekly, and monthly charts is over 70. Also a bullish indicator (to me). \n\n&nbsp;\n \n**Conclusion** \n&nbsp;\n\nFor me, personally, I think ASO is primed to have a big day this week if it volume gets high enough. By big day I mean spiking to anywhere from $45 - $60 before settling back into $35 - $40 and then slowly growing. If it goes any higher than $60 I will definitely be throwing a pizza party for my local store. \n \n&nbsp;\n \n\nThanks for reading my post. Good luck out there. [Enjoy this video of my dog eating a banana](https:\/\/v.redd.it\/p23legq9zuo61\/DASH_96.mp4). Dogs are apes too.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nPositions = 223 shares. [38 calls at various strikes expirations](https:\/\/imgur.com\/nC2pwHm). I sold 5 calls on Friday just to know what it feels like to close a position with a gain.\n \n&nbsp;\n\nEdit: Guess I'll update this since this post was written on Saturday. Looks like initial predictions were right. The stock has gone up. Calls are printing. Still think that the steady gains could attract enough volume that it could trigger a spike. Gamma or short squeeze, take your pick. We are very close to $35 at the time of this post, where there are a lot of calls held that could trigger a Gamma squeeze up to $45 now since they released new $45 calls last night. This stock keeps \"gapping up\", which makes me think that we aren't seeing the actual buy volume during market hours. It was the #3 stock talked about in the weekend threads and we aren't seeing the volume to match. My theory on that is that people are buying on RH and WB and other brokerages that don't settle buys until after hours. Hoping to gap up again to $35 Wednesday morning and then it should get really fun. Interestingly, there were $621k in $35 puts purchased between 10:00am and 10:05EST today, 4\/6. Maybe a way to depress the price further. Looks like this stock is another battleground between shorts and bulls with massive balls with kangaroos just dancing around enjoying their bouncing.\n\n \n&nbsp;\n\nEdit #2: What a dip! Guess the large volume of puts purchased this morning had the intended effect. Why else would you buy so many already ITM puts? Volume doesn't explain the dip, so I'm guessing that it was the puts. Lot of upward resistance at $30. Currently seeing a but wall of 11,500 shares at $30. Will assume that is the floor for now.","251":"I built a program that tracks mentions and sentiment of stocks across Reddit and Twitter! This week's most discussed and top growing stocks! This post is in continuation of [this](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/mikm42\/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and\/) post I made 2 days back. The response I received was amazing and lot of you were asking for weekly updates. So here goes!\n\n**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/tkhtpy8hq6r61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=cde4524f9c0f45d083d6370cce81e462640a965c\n\nGameStop continues to be the top discussed stock with more than 27K mentions. AMC dropped from 2nd to 4th position. PLTR gained in mentions and was the second most discussed stock last week due to a long-term deal they won with the U.S Department of Energy which is potentially worth 89 million dollars. ViacomCBS also made it into the top 10 but not in a good way. The company has lost 50% of valuation in the last 2 weeks and the sentiment reflects that. Rest all the companies are regulars in the top 10 list!\n\n**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/brep8x8qq6r61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=47be46b91c1230ab01f618066a0344277613d285\n\nAbove is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media.\n\n**ViacomCBS($VIAC)** was the company with the most growth in mentions. But, the average sentiment across the mentions was negative given the 50% drop in valuation. The stock had crossed the $100 mark on 22nd March 2021 and has lost more than 50% of its value since then. The market had been over-enthusiastic about the stock since the beginning of 2021 due to its effort of transforming to a streaming giant from a traditional cable media company. However, this enthusiasm was short-lived. There might be some scope for a short-term rebound.\n\n**ASO** was also growing in mentions due to their stellar earnings report. The company reported\n\n* Revenues were US$5.7b, approximately in line with what analysts expected.\n* (EPS) crushed expectations, coming in at US$3.79, an impressive 41% ahead of estimates.\n\n**Humanigen(HGEN)** reported phase 3 results of Lenzilumab\u2122 stating it improves survival without the need for mechanical ventilation in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The stock jumped 100% on Monday and has stabilized at around 34% increase from last week. \n\n**MicroVision(MVIS)** stock soared 50% on Wednesday. This is mainly due to Microsoft receiving a U.S. Army contract for augmented reality headsets. (It's estimated to be worth $21.9B over the next 10 years). There has been a lot of rumors stating Microsoft is planning to buy MicroVision which predominantly drove the discussions on MVIS.\n\n**FUBO** stock price has been on a continuous decline for the last 2 months (more than 50% drop) and there is now increasing chatter on whether it is oversold or on the path to a rebound \n\n**SOME FAQ\u2019s:**\n\nHow does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about the stock is positive or negative).\n\nWhat is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyze financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here is the average across all the comments\n\n*Disclaimer : I am not a financial advisor!*","252":"(DD) ASO options ladder is enticing, high short interest + good earnings This data is based off of ShortSight, paid real time short data from S3 partners.\n\nAs we can see, in the last few weeks, short interest in ASO spiked to \\~44%.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/t98kwbfwflq61.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c15011205d06acd072aa2d039288dad69dd71d4\n\nASO killing earnings on 3\/30:\n\n* All time high net income, 157% increase y\/y\n* 311% increases y\/y on adjusted net income\n* .97 EPS, for a 304% increase y\/y\n\nI see this as a reopening play + potential for a gamma squeeze.\n\n**Gamma squeeze + pressure on shorts to close**\n\nAs we've seen w\/ stocks like GME, options provide more leverage than holding shares for moving a stock's price. If there are a chain of strike prices w\/ high open interest and we manage to get close to the first link in that chain (in this case, $25 was the first link, while at the time of writing it is now $28.34), it can cause a reaction where MM need to delta hedge these options by buying shares (as they want to stay delta neutral and just make money off premiums), which increase the stock's price, which lets us hit the next link in the chain, etc. etc.\n\nForbes has a good article that explains this concept when applied to GME: [https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/georgecalhoun\/2021\/03\/10\/gamestop-the-second-surgeanatomy-of-a-gamma-swarm\/](https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/georgecalhoun\/2021\/03\/10\/gamestop-the-second-surgeanatomy-of-a-gamma-swarm\/).\n\nAs we can see, open interest is also high on options (ex: 19000 calls on 4\/16 for $30).\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/2ph9enq8hlq61.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f7105dc532cce8fc36164931e890c51656b9c65\n\nIf the stock can near\/hit $30, it will squeeze upwards due to the delta hedging by MMs. This will be exacerbated by the high short interest of 43%, all borrowed when the stock was at a lower price (\\~$23), shorts will feel high pressure to cover in order to minimize losses if this stock trends upwards.\n\n**Reopening play**\n\nDicks Sporting Goods no longer sells guns in Texas. As people go out more \/ reignite their hobbies, ASO will receive more business as now it is in position to be a primary seller of guns. Even as a long term hold (instead of playing the options chain) this seems like a good play.\n\n**The play**\n\nI think there's potential for a gamma ladder squeeze on the call options priced for 4\/16. The open interest is there, the catalyst is there (run up in stock price due to amazing earnings), and there's the additional high short interest which means if things moon, they'll moon even harder. The options right now are reasonably priced for this date as well.\n\n**The bear case**\n\nThe earnings report isn't enough to drive this stock near 30$ by 4\/16. Another catalyst doesn't come, or the market in general corrects (as we are at ATH). In this case, the call option ladder will fail to materialize.\n\n**Positions:**\n\n200 4\/16C w\/ $30 strike price.","253":"Is Blink Charging (BLNK) the next Gme? \n\nBlink Charging is a small cap American EV charging provider with a value of 1.45 billion. It has been rallying from a around $1 dollar to a yearly high of $64.00 but in the last couple months has dropped in value by almost half to $34.00 due to a rising short interest amongst hedge funds to around 41% making it one of the most heavily shorted stocks on the Nasdaq right now. Not sure what hedge funds are short but I feel there are a few reasons for this.\n\nThe main reason for this is that there are a number of other competitors that are making inroads in the market and that Blink is relatively small amount of market share at 8% at current. Chargepoint is the largest in the market. Although I feel that that what the hedge funds have overlooked is that there should be room for loads of companys in the EV charging industry. The sheer rate of growth in the EV market has driven this company up 1200% and that has potential to keep going. Blink has implemented a total of 15,760 charging stations and Apple has added all these stations to its Apple Maps which is massive for the company. We also should not underestimate the radical change to the global economy where clean energy is going to overtake traditional fossil fuels. America has a target I believe of 2035 for the phase out of fossil fuel transport while most of Europe has pledged to transform its economy to be carbon neutral by 2030 with EVs playing a major part in that shift. This indicates that there is huge upside for the company in the coming years.\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\n\nBelow I have highlighted a few of the fundamentals that are interesting and may look familar here including the current short interest (42%) and the current float 32 million. Thats around 20 million LESS than GME currently. \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\n\nAlso I checked on iborrowdesk where there is currently 45,000 shorts available very similar to GME at the moment although the borrow fee can be as high as 80%?? \n\nHere is where I got these numbers from if people want to expand on this.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.highshortinterest.com\/ \n\nhttps:\/\/iborrowdesk.com\/report\/CCGID\n\nHowever I do think that there is reason to claim the stock is undervalued regardless of what the squeeze potential may be if that sanario was to play out. What do you guys think I'm not a stock wizard by any means I'm just an Ape like you \ud83e\udda7\ud83e\udda7 all so it would be interesting to get your opinions. \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8e","254":"Hertz could become the next GME because of all the Melvins shorting it Because Hertz's bankruptcy protection status is well known, everybody knows that there is an extremely high chance that the shares will be cancelled.  **The stock is worthless and that's exactly why it can go to the moon**.\n\nBecause the stock will go to 0 soon, a lot of hedge funds are shorting the stock thinking that it is easy money.  But as Melvin Capital learned from Gamestock, some short selling strategies are extremely dangerous.  If they bet on a stock going down and the stock price goes up instead, they lose money.  If their cushion of margin runs out, they have to start closing out their short position at a loss.\n\n# The cost of borrowing Hertz shares indicates that short sellers have piled into this short\n\nAnybody borrowing shares of Hertz through Interactive Brokers has to pay **26.33%**.  The actual borrowing costs that short sellers pay is somewhere between 50-100% of that figure because they usually go with somebody cheaper than Interactive Brokers, so the actual borrowing cost is something **higher than 13%**.  (\\*Technically, IB rounds the share price up to the nearest dollar and the 26.33% is applied to that number, so the cost to borrow at IB is much higher than 26%.)\n\n13% is a really high interest rate.  Stock indexes have only gone up 6-10% historically.  The reason why borrowing costs get expensive is because too many people are trying to short a stock.  Because the supply of shares being lent out is less than the demand from short sellers, the borrowing cost shoots up into the autistically expensive range.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/l4wbu14r46q61.jpg?width=748&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=696a4a9c72b00593fcf1327bd9f7fe5253107c4a\n\nA lot of short sellers piled into Hertz increases the chance that there are dumb Melvins piled into Hertz.  The Melvins of the hedge fund world take on too much risk.  They are the dumb money that contribute to short squeezes.  When their short position moves against them too much, they will start buying the stock and cause the squeeze to get even bigger.  (They buy the stock to try to get out of their short position.)  Then they realize that they've been outplayed by a bunch of autists posting dumb memes on internet message boards.\n\n# Things that normally prevent short squeezes from getting out of hand\n\nFor most stocks like Gamestop, Nokia, etc. there are going to be institutional investors who buy the stock because they believe that it is a good investment.  If the stock then goes up 3X, many of them will sell their stock because it has hit their price target.  That kind of selling usually causes a short squeeze to end, which is what we've seen in Nokia.  As the autists and Melvins fight it out, the institutional investors step in and put an end to the party.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/83hp9ddd96q61.jpg?width=433&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bd78aacfbdab79695d06b6336eba8345b079b6db\n\nGamestop turned out a little differently because all of the institutional holders eventually sold everything and got flushed out that way.\n\nInstitutional investors have probably all cleared out of Hertz for two reasons:\n\n1. The vast majority of them aren't allowed to hold pink sheet stocks.\n2. Everybody thinks that Hertz stock will be a zero.  The bondholders will take over (or whoever the bondholders sell to, e.g. [Knighthead + Certares](https:\/\/ca.finance.yahoo.com\/news\/hertz-gets-4-2-billion-113503798.html)) and the shareholders will get wiped out because there isn't enough money in Hertz for the shares to be worth anything.  In the unlikely event that a bidding war breaks out, then maybe the shares could be worth something.\n\nSo if autists and short selling hedge funds were to have a short squeeze battle in this stock, it's unlikely that institutional investors step in and drive down the share price with their selling.\n\n# This is not an investment\n\nThe stock is almost certainly going to 0.  I have no position in Hertz and neither should you.  I'm posting this just for entertainment value.  If you're the kind of person who is willing to lose money to try to wreck hedge funds... this is for you.","255":"GME: When is it time to grab some popcorn?

I need to borrow your diligent, Aspergers level analytics ability and earth-shatteringly, retarded reasoning to pile drive my portfolio into the red.  I can't believe I'm actually coming here for advice.  Please see the \"case study\" below.\n\nI'm a huge fan of Dr. Michael Burry and how he manages Scion Asset Management, LLC. The guy does his due-diligence and thinks about his investment opportunities from an outside perspective. If the numbers and story pencil, he will bet against anyone and doesn't let the court of public opinion cloud his judgment.\n\nI'm inquiring about the recent Lumen Technologies (formerly CenturyLink) $LUMN trade.\n\nBased on my research, Scion Asset Management acquired 1.15M shares of $LUMN at an average value of $9.74 per share. This trade accounts for approx. 8.02% of Scion's portfolio. If we're looking at Burry's past investments, he's usually one of the first players to the table including both $GME (#diamond hands) and shorting the housing market. \n\nLumen has not only rebranded their name and marketing efforts, but their entire business strategy moving forward by selling B2B data and fiber optic services since many customers are moving away from phone lines\/services: (direct quotes from my research)...\n\n1. \"**Lumen** is a measure of the brightness of light, and the company\u2019s competitive advantage this century has come from its massive fiber network, stretching 450,000 route miles. That has helped CenturyLink survive even as consumers cut their home phone lines in favor of wireless providers and switched off DSL in favor of faster alternatives. But transporting light signals can also be a commodity service. Lumen is now pushing to offer more higher-value applications and enterprise services directly to its customers, reflected in the company\u2019s new motto: \u201c**The Platform for Amazing Things**.\u201d\n2. \"Lumen, which was primarily an ISP\/Phone company, stepped up their B2B and backbone connectivity to major Internet companies which the purchase of Level3. They'll be key to serving as the fiber backbone for 5G.\"\n\nEarlier today, I submitted a limit buy order for $LUMN @ $14.00 which won't be executed until tomorrow when the market opens. I don't believe this trade will turn a real profit for 1-2 years as turning a battleship of this size takes a significant amount of time and resources. But looking at the story and fundamentals, the strategy is sound. Outside the rebranding and change of strategy, Lumen is using some of the newly minted capital to paydown, high interest, debt.\n\nAm I too late on this trade or too retarded to function?  Good or bad, let me hear it.","258":"Deep GME Exposure Part 2 I\u2019ve gone through all institutional and mutual fund data that holds any share of GME.

Shitters formed an new bottom dip, for us to buy, and we love them because of that \u2764\ufe0f. The interesting thing here is, that the shitting and dipping and halting started at 12:20!\n\n**Conclusion**: WHAT AN AMAZING COINCIDENCE?! Yeahh... not excatly. We would like to call it here shitter\u2019s market manipulation.\n\nSSR has been triggered for the last trading days, which helped us to form an strong support at 13$. Anyway let\u2019s start with the premarket update\n\n**Pre market Update 09:02**: Germany is proudly hodling the support line which has formed the last few days between 13.10$-13.40$. We shall aid them in 28 Minutes when the stock exhange officialy opens. \n\nStocks available to short: 650.000\nCurrent Stock Price: 13.46$\n\n**Update 09:31:** Stock opens with 13.45$ and instanlt plumets down to 13.3$. We will have to fight at the support Line until we get some buying power rolling.\n\nStocks available to short: 650.000 (unchanged)\nCurrent Price: 13.35$\n\nStocks available to short dropped from 1,100,000 to 650.000 which explains the dip. Buy the dip apes!\n\n**Update 10:02:** Them Shitters used around 50.000 short stocks, that\u2019s why we see our resistance getting tested all the time. We should be up abd running in the next 1-2 Hours. 14$ isn\u2019t far away until than.\n\n**Update 10:10:** We touched 12.50$ and jumped right back to our support at 13$,\nI\u2019m sure we have quite few diamond hands holding there, good job. Anyway we had some massive volume at starting 30 Minutes, around 1 Million! The way back to 14$ shouldn\u2019t be too hard with all those stimulus checks incoming, I guess! Buy the FKN DIP until it ain\u2019t too late! \n\nCurrent Price: 13$\nShares available to borrow: 750.000\n\n**Update 11:03:** The dip stopped dipping. Last chance to buy some stonks. No seriously, we shall see some upward movement from here (12.74$). AMC is very likely gonna follow GME (which madd +10% in like 10 Minutes \ud83d\ude80). \nAnyway there is also bad news which actually is good news: The shitters have topped up their \u201cborrowable-shares\u201d it\u2019s sitting right now at 4.600.000 !!!! ... They could short the fuck out of us now and i would Love if that happens, because than .... THAN THEY WILL LOSE EVEN MORE MONEY once the \ud83d\ude80 starts off to the \ud83c\udf1a \n\nStocks available to Short: 4.600.000\nCurrent stock price: 12.94$\n\n**Update 11:12:** Im gonna predict something. Today at exactly some seconds before 12:20, we will see a massive Stonk Sell-Off from the Shitters, they will try and implement fear into us, but they won\u2019t succeed.\n\nStocks available to Short: 4.600.000\nCurrent price: 13.13$ &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;\u2014 is the stock price trying to tell us something? ... 13k13 which means 13.130!!!\n\n**Update 12:03**\n1.5 Million NEW shorts available which means there are now 6.100.000 Shorts available to the HFuckers. Wow, that\u2019s gonna be a bloodbath in some days, be ready for Impact any day and show them what diamond hands are made from. \nOur support line moves diagonally down which means, it is not anymore at 13, but moved rather down to 12.4-12.6$. As long as we dont lose that \nSupport today we should see some upward movement ... if HFuckers dont manipulate the market at 12:20 like yesterday.\n\nCurrently available shorts: 6.100.000 ... seriously.\nCurrent Price: 12.69 (well ... at this point you should tell your wifes boyfriend that amc said its 69 time)\n\n**Update 12:08**\nThe short borrowing Fee has massively decreased. It was 3 working days ago at 8%, now it is sitting at 1.8%. This is only embracing the fact that they are scared from our diamond hands and are preparing the next market manipulation.\n\n**Update 12:20**\nHedgieFuzzers have decided to not launch they\u2019re massive attack Today. They are probably stocking their positions up. But i\u2019m sure we will see the attack in the next days (Before we can see again daily profits of 30-50%)\n\nShorts available: 6.100.000\nCurrent price: 12.50$\n\n**Update 12:21**\nWhat is interesting here is, is the stock dynamic which upped the AMC price from 12.5$ up to 12.75 in under 2 Minutes.\n\nShorts available: 6.100.000 ... Fee changed from 1.8% to 1.7%\nCurrent Price: 12.75\n\n**Update 13:01**\nAMC is slowly refuelling it\u2019s motors and starting to scratch at 12.83 resistance. If we get rejected from this resistance , than an double top scenario could occur, which would push the price as low as to 12.50 (where also our support is). Time will tell.\nBesides that not much has happened.\n\nShorts available: 6.100.000\nCurrent price: 12.8$\n\n**Update 13:05**\nIt seems that we will break the 12.83$ resistance. Keep up diamond habds and buy the dip!\nWe also have an inversed head &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; shoulders to assist us in the push to 13$. \n\n**Update 13:55**\nWe have barricaded ourselves at 13$ and aren\u2019t planning on giving that mark away to the hedgies! \nThe next mark is around 13.6-14$. \nAnyway i have discovered something very mysterious. The available short stocks has decreased by 100.000. From 6.1mil to 6.0mil. Apes, all of you know what that means ... \\*apes nodding their head\\*\n... and if not ill tell you ... \\*apes breathe eases\\*.\nThis means the HedgeFuckers are preparing to decrease the stock price again, with my prediction being an mix between closing long positions and short attacking (SSR is enabled so this won\u2019t be very successfull, unless they manipulate the market again.). We should see attacks dropping the amc stock, when it starts scratching 14.10$.\n\nShorts available currently: 6.000.000\nPrice Currently: 13.15\n\n**Update 14:18**\nStill very quiet. Amc is preparing for the fight with resistance at 13.5-13.6$, once we break it we shall have a smooth ride to 14$.\n\nShorts available: 6.1mil\nCurrent Price: 13.3$\n\n**Update 14:30** \nShitters are making their moves again. See how the stock dropped 0.40$ unnormaly while being in an natural up movement supported by double buttom + inversed head ans shoulders and some \ud83e\udd8d Ape checks (stimulus). We should drop im the next minutes to 12.8$-12.9$ before our rocket refules for taking on the 14$ mark. \n\nShorts available: 6.1mil\nPrice: 13.02$\n\n**Update: 14:52**\nApparently we have failed the double bottom + inversed head and shoulders climb. But domething even better is coming up: rising wedge and the 5th leg are those 12.8$ where we are hovering right now. The 6th leg could catapult us to 14$! \n\nCurrent Price: hovering at 12.8$ and building up 5th leg\n\n**Update 14:57**\nQuick uodate on shorts available. The shitteres decreased available shorts by 200.000! Watch out for some massive barrier at 14$ or maybe even at 13.4$\nDid they allready use those 200.000 shorts? Probably not, but they reserved them so to say.\n\n**Update Hoodie** So i have been trying to guess some coupon codes on that shop below and it seems as they have made an *Easter egg** with the hidden code: **diamondhands**\nIt will give you an discount if you order something\nDon\u2019t believe me?

For the background of this post and all of the weaknesses of this stupid analysis, scroll down to the end.\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nFor all open contracts at close of business yesterday and yesterday's closing price of 220.14, total exposure decreased to **$2.546 billion** down from $3.084 billion yesterday. 87% of that exposure is tied up in the options shown in the Figures and Tables expiring Friday ($925 million), 4\/16 ($691 million), 7\/16 ($306 million), and 1\/21\/22 ($288 million). *See* Figure 1 and Table 1.\n\nIn terms of actual shares needed to cover short options that are in the money, our hypothetical single actor will need to find **11.5 million** shares of GME (or their equivalents) to cover their positions across all open ITM positions. This is approximately 21% of the float of GME and 16% of all shares outstanding. *See* Figure 2 and Table 2. This is down from 14.8 million shares needed to cover yesterday.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/2fcyn5yzfen61.png?width=1368&format=png&auto=webp&s=24999d1d11b7c115433f1fa80f8d77725ccb9a6e\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/t2lvij21gen61.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=57034e33c83cd18a44be38ba9d94e97e095a0801\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/5j8hole4gen61.png?width=583&format=png&auto=webp&s=041014b5b6078c198af04240eaf4654c469e296f\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/1q9o40t5gen61.png?width=514&format=png&auto=webp&s=8299e1c42d57f98d6f5182934fdcb0c6340c5a77\n\nLIMITATIONS\/WEAKNESSES\/BACKGROUND:\n\nThis is the result of a thought experiment asking a simple question: If a hypothetical single actor\/market maker was on the short side of all open options in GME, which means that he cannot simultaneously hold any long positions himself, what would that single actor's exposure be in terms of dollars? How many shares would that single actor need to find to cover all of the short positions?\n\nNote that this does not represent this market maker's \"loss.\" To sell an option, this hypothetical market maker received a premium as it does not take into account the premium the actor received for taking this short position.\n\nAlso, it also assumes that the actor has not already started purchasing\/selling shares on the open market to cover short positions.\n\nFinally, a major weakness of this curiosity is that, by its nature, it precludes the use of other long option positions to cover their short positions (since this hypo is set up with one guy being short on everything). In reality, we have multiple market makers who are constantly hedging themselves with other option contracts in the variety of neutral option strategies that exist for all options traders.","262":"Welcome to The Bank of Gamestop So I spent a considerable amount of time working through Eee Teee Efff's and looking at their institutional holdings, Pro Fintel data, and any other pro membership I could get into.

I think this is a good talking point. \"\n\nBuying the dip to average down when affordable is definitely the way, but there are circumstances where some movement in the opposite direction in regards to average price is not overly detrimental\n\nSomeone was talking about having learned the way of averaging down today in the discussion thread. I'm actually doing the opposite unfortunately with my GME. I bought in on the back side of the 2nd \"crash\" at a few times for an average **$75.55 a share** for 9 shares.\n\n\\-------------------------\n\nI've been buying fractionally when sensible and I'm sitting on 9.39 Shares now. in the process though my average has gone to $**85.8546 a share** ( a $6.01 change over 0.4 shares of fractional pickups.

Of course it extends beyond this, but the SLD payment in accordance with the old rules is calculated this week.\n\nA lot of people are hype about the new filing showing the NSCC can calculate SLD payments every day and demand it either intraday or before market open, but they're forgetting the previous rule *is still in effect*.\n\nSo this post is a culmination of, the NSCC calculating margin or clearing fund payments of members, then the previous rule showing the SLD **will** be calculated and must be paid by 17 March and further, what a default may mean if the SLD or Clearing Fund payment can't be paid on this date. \n\nFurther, if the new SLD rule comes into effect on 19 March and if a default hasn't been caused, what impact this may have as a chain of catalysts, which in my view, presents a vicious cycle for short members as time progresses. \n\nI'm not putting a date on things, just speculating what could be an interesting week with these rules in mind. As always, not financial advice and always do your own DD before making any financial decisions.\n\n_______________________________________________________\n\n**Catalyst 1**\nSo first things first, my previous DD (part II) regarding margin and payments into the clearing fund is dependent upon a member's risk profile. This risk grows with each dollar increase in the price of GME and with each day that short interest is paid. \n\nRemember, the matrix assigns a member with a pseudo credit rating and uses this to determine what has to be paid into the clearing fund based on 1. The member's portfolio risk and 2. Their ability to settle their positions through their financial report to the FICC. \n\nTherefore with each day that passes with short interest payments and with each day the price increases, so does this payment and this therefore restricts liquidity for those short, which may tip the balance of the supply and demand in demands favour, raising the price even further.\n\nThis in turn causes their portfolio to be deemed more risky and as their finances become more stripped, their credit rating drops, which in turn simultaneously increases the payment required into the clearing fund. This is the start of the vicious circle.\n\n_______________________________________________________\n\n**Catalyst 2**\nThe new SLD rule could indeed come into effect on 19 March making it so that ever increasing SLD payments are demanded from members and affiliates with each day, however what I think people are forgetting is **the previous rule still applies, and has to be paid in on 17 March**.\n\nEdit: Oh Citadel is issuing bonds for money are they? I wonder why....\n\nThis alone could drive a member into default, or again could severely restrict the liquid funds of that member on this date which again, could prove to tip the balance between supply and demand in demands favour, increasing the price.\n\nAs we know from Catalyst #1, this would in turn increase the sum needed to pay into the clearing fund and if this SLD payment pushes a member onto the NSCC Watch List guess what? You have to pay *even more* into the clearing fund , sripping your resources further. The cycle continues.\n\n_______________________________________________________\n\n**Catalyst 3**\nIf the above part of the cycle doesn't push a member into default, well on the quadruple witching date the new SLD rule may come into effect.\n\nEdit 2: Thanks to the comments, this is actually looking likely that this change will come into play in minimum 70 days, I don't think it affects the vicious circle and hey, if the fight goes on this long this step will still be relevant\n\nThis means either before market open or even intraday, if crazy price action occurs, the NSCC can name their price for payment from a member and force them to pay it **now** and then hold it and return it the next day if they survive defaulting.\n\nThis is in addition to the clearing fund payment. Are you seeing a pattern here? If the majority of your liquid funds are stripped again this could tip the supply and demand in favour of demand and the price goes up as you literally have no ammunition to stop it. \n\nWhich in turn kicks in Catalyst #1 with higher payments as your credit rating declines and your assets decrease and both Catalyst #1 and #3 rinse and repeat with each day until what? What breaks the vicious circle?\n\n_______________________________________________________\n\n**Rule 18 - a member defaults and the NSCC ceases to act**\n\nThis is what could cause a price explosion. If the member defaults owing to the vicious circle ripping their funds increasingly every day, well the NSCC seizes control of your portfolio and uses the SLD and the Clearing Fund (even those contributions from other members) to settle you out. All your short positions, bought back, which given the tiny volume of GME would cause a huge increase in demand and send this thing to the moon. \n\nSorry not enough emojis so far for you apes here ya go \ud83d\ude80.\n\nTherefore, keep your eyes out for the price action on 17 and 19 March but don't pin your hopes on them, if the vicious cycle described above defaults a short member, we'll see some interesting price action if the NSCC steps in and settles a position.\n\nTLDR: The current and new NSCC rules represent a vicious cycle which could force short positions to default, which in turn, allows the NSCC and co to step in a close out their positions\n\nEdit: formatting for easier reading","265":"Nokia and Its \u201cInfamous\u201d Float Listen up you absolute retards. \n\nI\u2019m sick and tired of hearing the narrative passed around:\n\n \u201cHurr durr Nokia Float too big- Nokia never move\u201d\n\nHere are some fun facts as of writing this post:\n\n1) Regardless of how \u201clarge the float is\u201d, Nokia\u2019s market cap right now is ~24 billion and is trading at $4.30\/share. \n\n2) Guess what hot company everyone has loved FOMOing into for the last 3 months? GME. Do you retards want to know what the market cap is for GME right now? ~25 billion while trading at $250\/share. \n\nQuite literally the only thing required for Nokia to move at the same rate as GME is for buyers to buy ~58 shares of Nokia for every one share you\u2019d have bought of GME. You\u2019d have spent literally the same amount on your investment with either choice. \n\nNot only that, but as you\u2019d have more shares amassed in quantity, when Nokia\u2019s value is recognized and it booms, you\u2019ll be able to make even MORE cash by selling covered calls against your shares. \n\nIf you wanted even more leverage, because I know you retards do, you could buy LEAPs now, and sell calls against them either now or in the future after the leaps have appreciated massively in value. \n\nAnd, make no mistake, Nokia is set to boom. They just announced major deals today with the biggest tech companies in the world- Amazon, Microsoft, Google. That\u2019s not even mentioning the non-stop contracts they\u2019ve won globally the last few months- major contracts.

Just because AMC has performed in lockstep in the past with GME does not mean this will continue indefinitely.\n\nAMC is not GME. AMC\u2019s management has issued a massive amount of shares proportional to previous outstanding shares to pay down their loans and rent, taken on new European debt, and the largest share holder has reduced from >50% to <10% stake. AMC will survive, but only because new shareholders are bailing them out by paying pre-dilution prices for new share offerings which directly allow the company the cash needed to pay their landlords. You aren\u2019t buying value or even contributing to a war chest that can be used for expansion, new shareholders who bought ATM offerings are giving the company cash just to survive. If you love the chain, want to contribute your money to their survival, and are aware of the dilution of outstanding shares (quoted at 450.2 million outstanding during the earnings call last week) then more power to you.  However, if you think AMC is anything like GME you have another thing coming. At least GME has a short squeeze thesis that management isn\u2019t actively sabotaging by issuing shares and Robert Cohen represents hope of future growth beyond what is possible for the business at present.\n\nIf you feel differently I would be happy to hear why you believe this company can increase shareholder value to compensate for the share dilution. Please let me know what I\u2019m missing.\n\nYours Truly,\nA smooth-brain who can\u2019t wrap his head around this one\n\nEdit: Ryan Cohen not Robert Cohen. I\u2019m pretty retarded but hey, that\u2019s why I\u2019m here.","267":"Hedging Fundamentals - Hedgefunds bad, hedging good! Dear apes and monkeys, I've loved the fundamentals series you had posted before it got absolutely drowned in animal adoption posts, you truly don't leave any ape behind!\n\nSo here's my part to hedging and why YOLO might be fun but a little bit more care when investing can help you to buy the dip and profit greatly!\n\n## Why Hedge?\nIt's always tempting to go all in on one very promising bet to take the most profits possible with the available bankroll. Always hitting the perfect timing for entry and exit consistantly is impossible, period. And it's even more complex than buying at the lowest point and selling the peak.\n\n\nAknowledging this fact is vital to understand why hedging does not only reduce the risk to the portfolio but in the long run leads to a higher return on investment.\n\nThis guide uses $100k as a baseline not because that's what everyone has, it just makes the math a little easier to read.\n\nFor convenience I'll use a price of $100 per share of your favorite stock.\n\n## Imagine this scenario!\nYour favorite stock has been doing well so far. Excluding events such as GME recently with factor x2 swings within a week or two minutes of trading, such as last wednesday, are more of an exception. But let's say it's been doing exceptionally good with +20% in a brief period of time. \n\nIf one has put 100% of its portfolio, $100k -> 1000 shares, into that stock the total value of this portfolio would now be $120k.\n\n\nAnd now a market correction hits, pushing the price down 30%.\n\nSome quick math (100%-30%) * $120k = $84k puts the portfolio value down -$16k in total.\n\n\nHedging in general would have cussioned that a lot. Let's use 20% of the portfolio for hedging and the 80% (800 shares) for your favorite stock.\n\nThe runup: $20k+(80%*$120k) = $116k\n\nThe dip (after rebalancing, discussed later): (80% * 116k *(100%-30%)) + (20% * 116k) = ~$88k, a dip of -$12k.\n\n\nThe hedging decreased the profits from +$20k to -$16k and the dip from -$16k to -$12k.\n\nBut that \"rebalancing\" is key here and makes all the difference.\n\n\n## Rebalancing\nIf your strategy is to use 20% of your portfolio for hedging those 20% might represent different dollar amounts with time. After that runup from $100 per share to $120 the value of the hedged portfolio was $116k.\n\nInitially $20k were used to hedge, now those $20k represent only 17.2% of the $116k. To get to 20% again some shares need to be sold in order to rebalance the hedge to $23k.\n\nStocks after the runup: 80%*$116k\/$120 -> ~773 shares (27 sold, started at 800)\n\n\nBut the same goes for the dip. Now those $23.2k represent 26% of the portfolio so you'll have to buy the dip to get it down to 20% again. So to rebalance you'll \"have to\" buy shares for $3.2k. \n\nTotal stocks after the dip rebalancing: $3.2k \/ $85 = 38 shares (811 shares in total)\n\n\nSince you're bullish on that stock you and I both assume the price will bounce back. But this time you'll have more shares than before, giving you an edge over the plain YOLO.\n\n\nBriefly:\n\n### Whenever the stock goes up, this strategy takes some profits without ever exiting the position.\n### Whenever the stock drops, this strategy buys the dip but never goes all in\n\n## When to rebalance\nThat's not easy to answer. If you're asking r\/investing folks monthly is more than enough but we're not investing in super stable low volatile ETFs here.\n\nMy rule of thumb is to rebalance when the planned allocation exceeds 10%. Want to use 20% for hedging? If your hedge goes below 18% or above 22% a rebalance could make sense. Since we're on WSB here people might hit 10% swings every single day and that's WAY too often.\n\n\nSo rebalancing maximum once per week and only if the allocation is off by 20% (so 16% or 24% with a 20% hedge) could be a sensible strategy.\n\nBut you'll have to see what works for you. Rebalancing too often means paying the spread every time for both the hedge and the bet and that adds up.\n\n\n## What can be used to hedge?\nThere are a lot of ways to hedge but as a rule of thumb everything which is pretty stable can be used. Low volatility, tried and tested in the last few corrections and recessions.\n\nYou should, however, still be able to quickly liquidate your hedge. This puts most if not all physical hedges out of the question.\n\n### Options\n\nOptions are the most powerfull hedge but are a lot more complex and won't be covered in depth here. It also throws off the math above a bit but can be used very effectively. \n\nBooks have been written about using options to hedge and a short summary would probably confuse more than help. I _highly_ reccommend reading \"The Greeks and Hedging Explained\" by P. Leoni for that.\n\n\nVery, very briefly and basic: You can use a PUT, preferrably a bit OTM (10% is common), to hedge your massive bullish position. Worst Case you'll lose 10% plus your premium which can vary wildly (Don't do this on GME. Just don't it's way to expensive).\n\n### Currency\nThis is the easiest hedge. Just leave some cash in your trading account without it being allocated in some stocks.\n\n### Precious Metals\nPrecious metals like gold and silver won't yield much returns if any but they usually go up when the stock market goes down. This will help you have the cash on hand you need to buy the dip.\n\nI don't reccommend buying physical metals as a hedge since the spread is massive, taxes are much more complicated and finding a buyer can take some time.\n\nThere are some theories on several funds not allocating 100% of the metal in vaults so if you're afraid of that Sprott not just promises to have that metal, they check regularly and prove it. Symbols are PHYS for gold and PSLV for silver.\n### SPACs (No, really!)\nSPACs are very interesting! They have a hard floor at $10 per unit (units contain a share and a fraction of a warrant) because they are required to have that amount of cash per unit issued at hand.\n\nThat's not just a pinky promise, those funds are monitored. They have two years to akquire a company or they get dissolved, distributing the funds or $10 to every shareholder, whichever is higher.\n\n\nSo why SPACs? Those funds yield some interest and if they do find a company to akquire the stock price may go up a lot. 50%-100% are not uncommon and using them as a hedge is almost riskless.\n\n\nWhat to look out for \/ type into google: Near NAV SPACs.\n\n### Stocks or stock based ETFs (not very good)\nYou _can_ use less volatile stocks or ETFs as a hedge but when the entire market goes down they will go down, too.\n\nSo if you want to hedge against a market-wide correction they might be the wrong hedge.\n\nIf you really don't want to miss out on general market growth and only want to hedge against a correction on your favorite stock but not the entire market, say right before earnings, stocks may be useful.\n\nI really don't like stocks as a hedge but if you really want to, some infrastructure \/ telecommunication companies (Not NOK or BB, they are too volatile due to WSB publicity) could be stocks to use here.\n\n### Inverse Funds\nThanks to u\/A_KY_gardener for brining these to my attention! Inverse funds don't exist for every stock or index but they can be used as a hedge on these, too. \n\nBasically whenever whatever they invert goes up, they go down and vice versa. \n\n\nThey are a bit awkward to use since they're inherently as volatile as their underlying stock\/index, but whenever the entire market goes deep into the red they're going to shine bright and green, offering some tendies to buy the dip.\n\n\n\nThere is one boring reason you can use them, depending on your local tax law, and that's to create losses on paper. If you bet both long on a stock or index and the same amount into these inverse funds then one of them will be up roughly whatever the other leg is down. If you realize the losses in the end of december then you'll have realized losses but unrealized gains going into the new year. That can delay the taxes to pay and you get to gamble with that tax money. \n\n## TL;DR\nWant to buy the dip but don't have any cash left? Well then your hedging sucked and you should read this guide again.\n\n\n## Afterword - Hedging and Hedgefunds; know the difference!\n### Hedgefunds bad\nYes.\n### Hedgefunds hedge?\nThey used to. Hedgefunds used to protect cash by utilizing complex financial instruments.\nThe goal was to protect the cash, not to increase it.\n\n\nThis has changed. Now they're exclusive to the ultra wealthy and trade anything and everything to beat the market.\n\nArt, stocks, weather, insurance, whatever. \n\n\nThey do hedge their super risky bets but recently it's become clear that these hedges are by no means allencompassing.\n### The shorting meta\nYou've seen kids build sandcastles and other kids coming around, give that castle a kick and it's all gone.\n\n\nImagine that's a company being built in years or decades and some piece of bad news leaving the company in shambles. They might be rebuild but that's going to take time.\n\nSince both the buildup and the teardown can be used to make cash and it's much, much easier, less risky AND FASTER to damage a company than spotting a good company with great potential.\n\nThat's why hedgefunds love shorting so much and why they talk about them identifying fraud so much, _\"They're the good guys\"_ and all that. Once they have spottet a target they'll dig up any dirt they can find or otherwise make sure the company is viewed as a bad investment to profit greatly.\n\n\n\nFound some wrong information? Please let me know and I'll edit it in with the appropriate credit!\n\nAny questions are very welcome but finding the time to answer them in depth could take a while.\n\n\nEdit 1: Added Inverse Funds\n\nEdit 2: Added rebalancing timing","268":"Simplifying Law DD series Part III - the vicious cycle of margin and SLD Ok so I've outlined a majority of things in my DDs, ranging from what the new rules mean, the margin and the matrix etc (please go back and read my previous DD if you think I'm not making sense). \n\nIn this DD, I'm setting out what I think they all might mean for this trading week, as we all know it's a biggie. Of course it extends beyond this, but the SLD payment in accordance with the old rules is calculated this week.\n\nA lot of people are hype about the new filing showing the NSCC can calculate SLD payments every day and demand it either intraday or before market open, but they're forgetting the previous rule *is still in effect*.\n\nSo this post is a culmination of, the NSCC calculating margin or clearing fund payments of members, then the previous rule showing the SLD **will** be calculated and must be paid by 17 March and further, what a default may mean if the SLD or Clearing Fund payment can't be paid on this date. \n\nFurther, if the new SLD rule comes into effect on 19 March and if a default hasn't been caused, what impact this may have as a chain of catalysts, which in my view, presents a vicious cycle for short members as time progresses. \n\nI'm not putting a date on things, just speculating what could be an interesting week with these rules in mind. As always, not financial advice and always do your own DD before making any financial decisions.\n\n_______________________________________________________\n\n**Catalyst 1**\nSo first things first, my previous DD (part II) regarding margin and payments into the clearing fund is dependent upon a member's risk profile. This risk grows with each dollar increase in the price of GME and with each day that short interest is paid. \n\nRemember, the matrix assigns a member with a pseudo credit rating and uses this to determine what has to be paid into the clearing fund based on 1. The member's portfolio risk and 2. Their ability to settle their positions through their financial report to the FICC. \n\nTherefore with each day that passes with short interest payments and with each day the price increases, so does this payment and this therefore restricts liquidity for those short, which may tip the balance of the supply and demand in demands favour, raising the price even further.\n\nThis in turn causes their portfolio to be deemed more risky and as their finances become more stripped, their credit rating drops, which in turn simultaneously increases the payment required into the clearing fund. This is the start of the vicious circle.\n\n_______________________________________________________\n\n**Catalyst 2**\nThe new SLD rule could indeed come into effect on 19 March making it so that ever increasing SLD payments are demanded from members and affiliates with each day, however what I think people are forgetting is **the previous rule still applies, and has to be paid in on 17 March**.\n\nEdit: Oh Citadel is issuing bonds for money are they? I wonder why....\n\nThis alone could drive a member into default, or again could severely restrict the liquid funds of that member on this date which again, could prove to tip the balance between supply and demand in demands favour, increasing the price.\n\nAs we know from Catalyst #1, this would in turn increase the sum needed to pay into the clearing fund and if this SLD payment pushes a member onto the NSCC Watch List guess what? You have to pay *even more* into the clearing fund , sripping your resources further. The cycle continues.\n\n_______________________________________________________\n\n**Catalyst 3**\nIf the above part of the cycle doesn't push a member into default, well on the quadruple witching date the new SLD rule may come into effect.\n\nThis means either before market open or even intraday, if crazy price action occurs, the NSCC can name their price for payment from a member and force them to pay it **now** and then hold it and return it the next day if they survive defaulting.\n\nThis is in addition to the clearing fund payment. Are you seeing a pattern here? If the majority of your liquid funds are stripped again this could tip the supply and demand in favour of demand and the price goes up as you literally have no ammunition to stop it. \n\nWhich in turn kicks in Catalyst #1 with higher payments as your credit rating declines and your assets decrease and both Catalyst #1 and #3 rinse and repeat with each day until what? What breaks the vicious circle?\n\n_______________________________________________________\n\n**Rule 18 - a member defaults and the NSCC ceases to act**\n\nThis is what could cause a price explosion. If the member defaults owing to the vicious circle ripping their funds increasingly every day, well the NSCC seizes control of your portfolio and uses the SLD and the Clearing Fund (even those contributions from other members) to settle you out. All your short positions, bought back, which given the tiny volume of GME would cause a huge increase in demand and send this thing to the moon. \n\nSorry not enough emojis so far for you apes here ya go \ud83d\ude80.\n\nTherefore, keep your eyes out for the price action on 17 and 19 March but don't pin your hopes on them, if the vicious cycle described above defaults a short member, we'll see some interesting price action if the NSCC steps in and settles a position.\n\nTLDR: The current and new NSCC rules represent a vicious cycle which could force short positions to default, which in turn, allows the NSCC and co to step in a close out their positions\n\nEdit: formatting for easier reading","269":"How are GME and GS2C (the GME listing in Frankfurt) related?

Big week ahead with other recent news. Maybe fourth time posting is the charm. Alright smooth brains, strap in. This is going to be a wild ride. I said I wouldn't post more $NOK DD...I lied.\n\nObligatory, I didn't wear a helmet growing up, so I'm not qualified to give financial advice. I just like the stock.\n\nMy position: I'm in for a bit over 2,500 shares and 211 calls.\n\nThis is going to be a two-tiered DD that will focus on the very near term (this week) and a bit longer time frame.\n\n***1. Open Options expiring 3\/19***\n\nI've written a bit about this in my past NOK DD posts, but I want to give just a small look at it again, as this week is shaping up to be incredibly wild with Nokia. Aside from the already astronomical OI on call contracts, we have two catalysts that will come into play this week. The first is stimulus money. As we all know by now, that sweet sweet government money is going to start hitting accounts today and over the next few days. Now, IDGAF what you do with that money, but we already know that a massive amount is gonna go straight into the market:\n\n[https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/naeemaslam\/2021\/03\/12\/190-billion-of-stimulus-money-could-go-straight-to-the-stock-market\/?sh=c0bdae93936a](https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/naeemaslam\/2021\/03\/12\/190-billion-of-stimulus-money-could-go-straight-to-the-stock-market\/?sh=c0bdae93936a)\n\nWhy that is especially important for NOK. NOK is currently the #1 stock on Robinhood, a frequent top 20 stock here, and around 100k watchers on another platform (not sure if we can mention it here or not). Needless to say, NOK has more retail eyeballs on it than pretty much any other stock except for GME, AMC, and a handful of the other big boys (TSLA \/ FAANG \/ ETC). So, you tracking me....stimi money make NOK go \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80.\n\nThe second catalyst is Nokia's Capital Market Day event taking place on 3\/18. If you want any more information on that, you can scroll through my post history. I'll sum it up. CMD could be a paradigm altering event for Nokia. Their new CEO has been aggressive with increasing FCF, and it's working. They are now seeing great cash flow increases even during COVID. This puts them in a position to either increase buybacks, reinstate dividends, or invest heavily into R&D to take over 5G\/ be a frontrunner for 6G.\n\nThis all leads me to the wild options chain expiring next Friday. At this point, if you don't know what a gamma squeeze is, then I can't really do anything for you. This last week was huge as we went from well under $4, to well over it. That completely changed the ball game on 42k option contracts at the $4 strike. It put them well ITM, drastically increasing the delta on the options. Now that they are well ITM, the delta on those (currently .7433) will only increase as we draw closer to expiry. The next strike is $4.50 and we have around 26k OI on those. Gamma and Delta on these are currently .7260 and .3078, respectively. I'm curious what kind of action we see Monday PM. This week is looking like it's going to shape up like the wild week back in January. That week NOK closed on Friday at $4.20, and this Friday it closed at $4.21. The Monday of that week, NOK basically gapped to $4.75 and started it's wild ride. If that happens again, or if we see any movement closer to $4.50 early in the week, things will get wild.\n\n**The \"finish line\" on the craziness is the $5 calls.** There is currently 133k OI at the $5 strike. This is an absolutely mind boggling amount of calls open this close to expiry. Currently, they are essentially worthless with a bid at .03 at close on Friday. However, if we see stimulus money poured in and any sort of positive rumors preCMD, we could see the price action of NOK drift towards $4.75-4.90. At this point, the gamma squeeze begins on those $5 calls, and could set off a wild ride. I don't foresee something like what happened back in January happening again, but all of the catalysts are there to make it happen again...if not more this time around. It really all stems around CMD. If they come out with some wildly positive news, this thing could explode.\n\nBonus...there is another 64k OI @ $6, 53k @ $7, and 45k @ $8, to keep the ride going.\n\n**2. Relevant news since my last DD Post**\n\nI thought a lot about not posting another DD post, but I just feel the news is coming so fast and often with Nokia lately, that someone should at least compile the big pieces together and post them here for the sub's benefit. I won't add much too much commentary on each piece.\n\nFirst, the FCC reiterated their stance on Huawei and ZTE as security risks. IMO, this is a big one. It shows that the administration isn't going to stray away from the previous one's stance on the Chinese 5G companies. This gives Nokia, Ericsson, and Samsung a few more years to develop an oligopoly in the US market.\n\n[https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/usa-china-tech-idINKBN2B5022](https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/usa-china-tech-idINKBN2B5022)\n\nSecond, in the same vein as the previous one. It looks like India is going to institute a Huawei ban.\n\n[https:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/economy\/2021\/3\/11\/india-may-block-chinas-huawei-over-security-fears-officials](https:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/economy\/2021\/3\/11\/india-may-block-chinas-huawei-over-security-fears-officials)\n\nLastly, Samsung and Nokia signed a deal for Samsung to pay royalties to Nokia for a patent license. This one doesn't have anything to do with 5G, but something to do with video standards. The bigger piece in this one is Samsung's apparent rift with Ericsson. If Samsung needs access to some sort of 5G patent, it appears they are more wiling to play ball with Nokia than Ericsson. It also shows how wide Nokia's patent landscape is.\n\n[https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-nokia-patent-samsung\/nokia-signs-patent-license-pact-with-samsung-idUSKBN2B30ML](https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-nokia-patent-samsung\/nokia-signs-patent-license-pact-with-samsung-idUSKBN2B30ML)\n\nThere are so many more things that I'm looking out for on the Nokia front. Here is a very short list:\n\n\\- What other countries will institute Huawei\/ZTE bans. At this point it appears it's going to be a China vs. the world battle when it comes to 5G\/Data infrastructure.\n\n\\- Either at CMD, the annual meeting in April, or the next ER we should get an update on their ReefShark delivery percentage. It is their top KPI as a company. The higher % of ReefShark they have across the network, the more profitable their networks segment becomes.\n\n\\- Can they keep increasing FCF in the next few ERs? Kind of tied into ReefShark and a ton of other factors.\n\n\\- What kind of contracts does the US DoD sign with Nokia in the near future?They were part of the $600M deal back in the fall of last year, and at this point it looks like the government wants to work with either NOK\/ERIC for that kind of buildout.\n\n\\- Will we see some sort of stimulus in order to build out 5G networks in the US\/EU? Goes back to my China vs. everybody point earlier. I'd like to see the FCC utilize the massive haul they got in the latest spectrum auction to provide grants or some sort of funding to the telco companies to actually build out the networks in those spectrums.\n\nLastly, if anyone makes a comment about the float being a hinderance to NOK's ability to move, I will buy them an all expense paid trip to the Crayola factory. I will send an email to the CEO, and ask them to work with you to create a new color. It will be called, \"WSB Short Bus Yellow\". Nearly 3B shares were traded in one week back in January, and it could have been more if not for RH and other brokers shutting it down. There are way more than enough retail and institutional eyeballs on Nokia to see the volume it needs in order to move.\n\nTL:DR - NOK's CMD event on 3\/18 could cause a massive gamma squeeze with nearly 200k OI on calls ITM or close to being ITM. Stimi money pumping in this week with tons of retail eyeballs on NOK sets up for what could be an extremely interesting week. We almost saw $10 print in January, and all the factors, if not more, are in play this week.","272":"Simplifying Law DD series part II - NSCC rules relating to their 'watchlist' and margin Here we go, another entry into the series for my own amusement as I jot things down and attempt to make legal nonsense, sense. If you other apes gain a wrinkle or two too, well that's just gravy.\n\nPart I [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/m3vhmg\/simplying_law_dd_series_nscc_rule_18_and_gme\/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)\n\nLet me clarify first, the point of this series is to grant a better understanding for us apes on how the NSCC (and DTCC) does business, or any other legal stuff for that matter, relating to securities. This is to prevent FUD surrounding quotes of rules or rulings which, when taken out of context, seem like they won't help \/ cause fear in the DTCC and co won't pay or find a way out of paying when the inevitable squeeze happens, in addition to the new rule.\n\n*If you don't want to read my stuff, just know the DTCC is and remains on the hook should a member default and they have so much credit, cash and assets the squeeze will hurt, but never finish them, maybe*\n\nAnyway, I had the thought that surely the NSCC (and therefore by extension, the DTCC and sister companies) doesn't just wait until the proverbial shit hits the fan, or waits till the ass is primed in the fan's direction after a spicy meal, before it decides to protect itself. Big money likes to stay big money. You may think well no shit, but I doubt many of you know exactly how they do so.\n\nThis DD relates to what the NSCC and co does *before* a member (such as Citadel) or their family affiliates securities (such as Melvin) Default and enter Rule 18 i.e. Part I and defaults), **in addition to the new SLD filing**.\n\nAs always, not financial advice, do your own research and if that means you point to me and say stupid ape wrong, I'm glad to hear it. Fling it at me.\n\nOnto the DD, it actually relates to an amendment of rule which is thankfully 10 pages long.\n\nThe rule amendment I'm looking at (File No. SR.-NSCC-2017-010) relates to how the NSCC detects funky trade moves from members and affiliates, and determines margin payments. Remember the NSCC handles the majority of clearing, so they know what's been traded, in the vast majority of cases. \n\nThe FICC also knows what they're worth too, so they can assess a member and any affiliates' ability to settle their portfolio when things get hairy, both from a portfolio and financial standpoint. The NSCC and FICC work together on this.\n\nSo the NSCC has something called a 'risk matrix' which helps them determine a member's margin, or a charge they have to pay into the NSCC's clearing fund, depending on how much risk their portfolio places the NSCC under with respect to their positions and financial clout.\n\nI can't shake the imagery that this rule is like members and their affiliates are aware the market is a simulation and get slaps on the wrist if they fuck with it, whereas we apes are forced to play by the rules, until we came along and ate the red pill that is GME when they were caught with their pants down. I digress.\n\nThe clearing fund is the 'uh oh someone may default and we need to settle' cash reserve, and it is collected from all members, even those on the right side of trades. They just pay less, but every member has to pay into it to protect the NSCC, the price of membership. The difference is, those more in risk pay more to account for their risky portfolio.\n\nAs I said, the risk matrix extends to all members and affiliates, and it represents a measurement like a credit rating. To calculate the risk, the NSCC gathers up all their member's portfolio info and the FICC tells them what each of their financial capabilities are. An algorithm then determines a rating.\n\nAs an example, you're potentially in the hole for $2b and you have a total assets and liquidity of $2.5b, matrix sends alarm bells to the NSCC of crap this member's or this affiliate is in the shit, scrape some money now or it'll hurt you later. A good member may get AAA rating if their risk is nowhere near what they're worth, so a token donation from you.\n\nFurther, if you find yourself on the NSCC watchlist, well your margin payment is going to increase too. Those on the watchlist are essentially those with a bad 'credit rating\" in the eyes of the matrix, who either continue or increase in that position, or else have failed to raise enough capital to balance their risk relative to their assets or both. This rule SPECIFICALLY brings in affiliate investments, likely so risky positions can't be held in such entities without risk.\n\n*An aside - could this be why Citadel invested in Melvin? It's speculative but imagine you've lost billions and then you're slapped with a fat margin bill as you can't exit the position or else default, seems like a great time for a predatory institution to come in and grab your shares at discount prices. Just saying.*\n\nSo how does this relate to the situation? Well as Part I described you want to avoid defaulting as much as possible or else your ass gets liquidated.\n\nSpeculation: Now imagine you're a Melvin who's lost billions and doesn't have the capital to front the charge for your risky position, you then default and your ass gets liquidated and that's you done, out the market. Citadel steps in and 'invests' in you so you can sell out your risky positions to them and you can legally say you closed out your position and their assets make the charge less because your position in the matrix is better as you're better capitalized.\n\nNext, you try and tank the stock but it doesn't work. Citadel then has the increased charge for their position with each day that goes by. The current SLD is measured against the last 24 months trading and the investment into Melvin you can hide as it wasn't your investment, but you're eating a lot of money in interest.\n\nThe longer this goes on for higher prices, the quicker you're done. When the SLD rules come into place and the NSCC demands a larger sum of what you can handle when the rule change passes, you default and they settle you out. The incentive is only to keep kicking the can down the road and pray retail gets bored as both of you are done if this doesn't happen. Which it won't if apes hold.\n\nTLDR: this situation for Melvin and Citadel is like being stuck in an underwater cave and finding an oxygen tank from another trapped person. Sure, you'll last longer, but that canister will run out eventually and you're done.","273":"Simplified FOMC Playbook for Smooth Brains **How to play FOMC this week**\n\nHaven\u2019t really been keeping up with WSB lately due to all the meme hype, so hopefully this isn\u2019t repetitive of anything people have said lately. As you know, FOMC is coming up this week on the 16th and 17th. The Federal Reserve will post the changes on the ~~16th~~ 17th (Wednesday-shout out datguypete for catching that) at 2 PM EST. I did a quick browse on WSB to make sure this post wasn\u2019t repetitive, and saw a few things explaining FOMC\/YCC\/SLR and potentially devastating effects, but I did not find anything regarding how to profit each of the 4 scenarios. Most seemed like doomsday posts, but I'm here to tell you, no matter the outcome of the FOMC, you can profit obesely. Not fat profits. *Obese profits.*\n\n**I\u2019ve explained below the 4 different scenarios and outcomes of the FOMC and what to play in regards to those outcomes. If you don\u2019t want to read this, I\u2019ll put a TLDR cheat sheet at the bottom.**\n\nMy final paragraph includes GME and AMC for those of you who bear so much sexual aggression to those stocks that society should not allow you to be out in public due to the *safety of others.*\n\nIf you haven\u2019t kept up with everything regarding treasuries and the SLR policy, I\u2019ll try and fill you in without you having to know the finance technicals and what not. This is not a doomsday post so don\u2019t throw a tantrum when I mention bubbles which beginsssss *now* -&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; Right now we currently are in every bubble possible, but certain ones are more important to keep going instead of other ones (to save face). J Pow has been kicking the can further and further to hold off the inevitable, ultimately making things worse each time he does it. There\u2019s a few different types of bubbles: market (housing in this case), commodity, stock market, credit bubble, economy bubble. Asset inflation is very profitable for the wealthy, and for those who know how to use it to their advantage, which is why Wall Street wants the economy and stock market to overheat. On the other hand, asset inflation destroys those who cannot afford assets, as they won't be able to buy a home, a car, or invest, because that inflation seeps into necessities, leaving them no money to invest and get ahead. Which is why the wealth gap rapidly expanded during covid to levels unseen since the lead up to the 1929 crash.\n\n**Types of Bubbles:**\n\n**Commodities** \n\nMoon during inflation (lumber, oil, coffee, copper, sugar, etc). Most likely won\u2019t see this crash until later on. Because this is the final stage of inflation before prices begin to inflate groceries which is a big influence on CPI. Things like sugar and coffee beans increase the price of groceries that include those ingredients. \nThe Federal Reserve goes off the CPI when reporting inflation, and even changes the rules when they publish them, to keep CPI down. We\u2019ve been locked up, so the massive money injections are found in assets, such as the housing market, commodities, and the stock market. All this asset inflation will eventually spill over to CPI, and when that happens, the Fed will increase their rates, popping everything. The trickle begins to grow into a pour the more the economy opens up.\n\n**Housing bubble**\n\nResidential real estate in this case, although commercial are on the rise (they took a massive hit when covid hit unlike residential because WFH\/Stimmys\/Low mortgage rates, while offices and commercial buildings closed down).  Commercial real estate isn\u2019t a bubble yet, but since prices were historically low, and real estate inflation is building fast, i believe these will rise the fastest (VNQ is very lucrative, it also just closed above major resistance Friday). Most likely won\u2019t let this crash until end of summer or during the fall.\n\n**Stock market** \n\nVery clear and everybody knows it, but it\u2019s not about if, it\u2019s about when. Unlikely they\u2019ll let it fail right now. Most likely won\u2019t crash until end of summer or during the fall. A crash of the stock market would mean people panicking about their life savings, and saving their money, rather than spend it in the reopening of the economy.\n\n**Credit Bubble** \n\nQE, low fed rates, stimulus, credit forbearance, student loan forbearance, rent forbearance, etc all built the credit bubble. Probably won\u2019t let this fall because it\u2019ll be mayhem, and will lead to the pop of all the other bubbles. Although, the rent moratorium ending March 31st might exacerbate the credit bubble, paired with no more stimulus forecasted in the future.\n\n**Economic bubble**\n\nRelated to the concept of market bubbles is the idea of a general economic boom. A boom implies that the economy expands at an unsustainably fast rate, leading to inflation (e.g. aggregate demand grows faster than productive capacity). Ultimately an economic boom usually proves unsustainable. There may be a strong link between market bubbles and an economic boom. For example, a house price bubble may cause rising wealth and confidence leading to higher consumer spending and economic growth. In turn, the higher economic growth feeds the housing boom. Clearly they won\u2019t let this pop right now because we\u2019re finally reopening. Even though reopening will exacerbate it immensely.\n\n\nSo as you can see, we\u2019re in quite a pickle. A lot comes down to FOMC.\n\n\n**Things to watch at FOMC:**\n\n**Yield Curve Control**\n\nIncreases our debt tremendously adding to inflation. Lowers yields on treasuries that have been mooning lately, as they vastly increase the amount of bonds they buy to decrease the yield. We\u2019re already doing this somewhat, as the Fed spends $120b a month on bonds.\n\n**Supplementary Leverage Ratio** \n\nWhen covid first caused havoc, the Federal Reserve eased the leverage rules for large banks by exempting certain investments from their leverage calculations. If that sentence sounds like pig Latin to you don\u2019t worry it doesn\u2019t matter if you understand it, what matters is how to make money off the policy extension\/ending. The banks were able to exempt any holdings in U.S. Treasury debt or deposits at the Fed from their calculations of the supplementary leverage ratio. It was supposed to end March 31st. Everybody thought that was the plan. J Pow even said a few months back they have no plans of extending it. But then the yields began to rise and fast. \n\nRecently, J Pow shocked the public by hinting they might extend the SLR, or potentially make it permanent. They can\u2019t afford to do YCC (they might anyways because they have a trend of positive short term outlook at the cost of long term growth), so if they get rid of SLR without YCC, more than likely every bubble pops. Not extending SLR means that every bank potentially sells off over a trillion dollars in treasuries, skyrocketing the yields, causing a huge tech sell off, and more than likely bringing the entire market with it, popping the stock market bubble. Mortgage rates move with the 10 year treasury, so mortgage rates skyrocket, popping the housing bubble. A popped housing bubble, will pop the credit bubble. And so on. Eventually sending us into a catastrophe worse than the covid recession (if you want to call that a recession), and potentially worse than the Great Depression. Higher yields means that the debt the Federal Reserve has put themselves in, becomes more costly, and the Federal Reserve and the United States government will become bankrupt and default on the debts we owe to foreign countries. However, lots of people on Capitol Hill are begging the Federal Reserve to not extend it, because SLR is one of the most important regulations for Wall Street to not take advantage of the average Joe, and was implemented after the 2008 crisis. The relaxed SLR covid policy is the reason why the wealth gap grew to levels unseen since 1929 (right before the Great Depression) during Covid.\n\nRather than fearing inflation and moving to cash (which is dumb as hell if there\u2019s inflation on the rise, because your money becomes less valuable by the minute), use it to your advantage.\n\n**4 scenarios and how to play them:**\n\n**YCC implemented, and SLR is extended**\n\nPlay REIT ETFs (i have calls on VNQ expiring Friday that i bought at close last Friday). I might sell before the FOMC. The combo of both of these means inflation dramatically goes up, while yields will become incredibly suppressed, keeping real estate prices inflating, and mortgage rates low. Can also begin playing speculative technology again. I\u2019d be cautious tho. Because there\u2019s a chance people start selling bonds faster than YCC and SLR can support it. Collapsing the whole bond system, wiping 80%+ off of Nasdaq. J.P. Morgan predicted a minimum crash of 20% if the 10 year treasury yield hits 2.00%.\n\n**YCC not implemented, but SLR is extended**\n\nYields might continue to rise, but not as fast as if YCC and SLR were both off the table. Probably could diversify with commodities and REIT. This one will be the least volatile and markets will probably continue to rise for a bit but slowly. This is the current state we\u2019re in. Yields are still dramatically rising, but not as fast as they would with SLR being shot down. I\u2019d play blue chips and value stocks IMO as well. If yields continue to rise, I\u2019d begin shorting QQQ with puts, because once the 10 year hits 2.00%, there will be at least a 20% correction on the Nasdaq. I\u2019d start buying puts around the 1.85% yield mark.\n\n**YCC not implemented, and SLR is not extended**\n\nHold on to your seat belts. Yields are going through the absolute roof. Buy puts on TLT and make a fortune. Out of all the profit calculations on options I\u2019ve ever done in history, this one is by far the most lucrative in terms of potential. Yields rise as bonds sell off. The lack of YCC and SLR will cause a massive sell of on bonds and potentially cause a gamma squeeze downwards. I\u2019m talking 10k worth of puts being worth tens of millions in a months time.\n\n**YCC implemented, and SLR not extended**\n\nMassive increase in inflation, yields will probably go down. Commodities play. Don\u2019t buy precious metals, because they\u2019re not based off anything anymore. And they\u2019re heavily manipulated. Buy ITB puts (home construction) and calls on commodity ETFs. Lumber will continue to skyrocket to the point that home builders will have to charge insane prices due to supply cost, leading to dramatically less demand. It\u2019s currently forming a head and shoulders on the 1 month chart. Also the moratorium ends March 31st as well, leading to foreclosures. This will increase the supply of available homes on the market, thus, even less demand for home builders.\n\nI personally believe the market wide crash will not happen until the economy is fully up and running, leading to a severe overheating of the economy. This is will cause the federal reserve to finally increase their rates once the CPI is finally hit hard. This is the catalyst for popping the mother of all bubbles. Might happen at the June FOMC, but more than likely it\u2019ll be at the July, September, or November one. I think the highest probability is the September FOMC. Although, congress has to decide on the debt ceiling situation by July, and if the raising is rejected, that\u2019ll cause the pop. Build up that capital by playing the policies to your advantage until then. Once you\u2019ve built up enormous capital, you can buy puts on the SPY and ride around in your private jet safely while the country is up in flames.\n\nIn short, **do not place your bets in terms of the market**. Place your bets on the **feds policies** and **how those policies affect the overall markets**, and more importantly, the **subcategories** of the markets. Watch the ventriloquist (Fed), not the puppet (markets). Individual stocks are subject to manipulation, but ETFs are harder, as it\u2019s harder and riskier to manipulate all the stocks in the industry. Which is why I do options on ETFs, rather than individual stocks. Just watch out for dividend risk. Many platforms don\u2019t inform you that you have to pay dividends of those contracts to the contract seller, and those costs aren\u2019t included in the contract costs. A 3% dividend might not seem like a lot, but remember, each contract is equivalent to 100 shares.\n\nHopefully this helps y\u2019all. There\u2019s money to be made in every market. When one market goes down, another one rises. If you can\u2019t find it, keep looking. If there\u2019s an off chance of literally no bull market (highly unlikely), flip the chart upside down and your calls now become puts.\n\nAMC\/GME will probably be profitable this week, but there WILL be a rug pull. Smart money vs dumb money ultimately comes down to the risk\/reward ratio. Dumb money focuses more on the reward side, while smart money is focuses on the risk side. Set stop losses and realistic price targets (realistic for GameStop, as I believe it can multiply in price multiple times this week. Clearly, thinking Apple will multiply in price this week would be very unrealistic). Hedge funds are buying in as well. They see dumb money flooding the system and can profit off of it. Watch the volume in real time. Short and rapid volume rises means retail investors, large instantaneous leaps means institutions are buying. When they sell, the price squeezes downwards, as stop losses get triggered.\n\n**TLDR;**\n\nYCC implemented, SLR extended: calls on REIT ETFs (VNQ)\n\nYCC implemented, SLR not extended: ITB puts (home construction etf), calls on commodities (CPER, PDBC, GSG)\n\nYCC not implemented, SLR extended: stonks go sideways, diversify with calls on REIT and commodities (not precious metals) (lumber\/sugar\/coffee\/copper)\n\nYCC not implemented, SLR not extended: yields moon\/potential market crash. Buy puts on TLT (20 year bond prices crater and fast)\n\nIf you want to make big money fast, print\/make a cheat sheet of those 4 TLDR plays while watching the FOMC live. Set up your trade drafts in different tabs so all you have to do is click a button and beat the herd. If they announce one of the policies first, you can close out half of the plays, leaving only two tabs. I suspect we\u2019ll do YCC not implemented and SLR extended, as it\u2019ll slow the rise in yields, and also not cause massive volatility. Markets will be calm and the Federal Reserve lives to see another day.\n\nOne ^more thing^:\n\nThere is a potential for a market crash during quad witching hour, regardless of the outcome of FOMC. Wall Street might doing a massive rotation from growth to value. This could plummet the value of growth stocks very quickly, setting off stop losses. If this happens, people could panic sell and it could snowball, bringing down the entire market with it. I don't believe there is a big chance of that, but there is a chance. I think it'll stabilize after a few trading days, but I thought I'd throw that out there.\n\nIf I'm wrong or misinformed about anything in the post, please comment below. Or if you have some tips on some plays regarding one of the 4 scenarios, let me know. *Let's make these tendies.*\n\n**EDIT (because y\u2019all keep messaging me and commenting about one of them going down or wanting to yolo into one) -**\n\n**My positions for this week: **\n\n$135 3\/19 TLT Puts\n\n$65 3\/19 ITB Puts\n\n$95 3\/19 VNQ Calls\n\n**TLT and ITB are betting that FOMC causes a spike in yields.**\n\n**VNQ is my hedge if I\u2019m wrong and yields fall.**\n\nIf yields spike, good, I make a lot of money. If yields fall, good, I still make enough to cover the expenses of the others expiring worthless, while still making profits. Stop messaging me laughing that one of the three are down, I know at least one will go down, that\u2019s the whole fucking point of hedging.\n\n*And no, those 3 positions aren\u2019t my entire account. Even though I diversified, it\u2019s only about a tenth of my portfolio. It\u2019s very important to have the humility to admit to yourself that no matter how much time and effort you put into research, there\u2019s still a possibility you could be wrong. There\u2019s no such thing as a sure thing. If you think something is a for sure thing, it\u2019s almost a for sure thing that you\u2019re wrong. I\u2019ve been burned too many times over the past years to risk a big portion of my portfolio on weeklys. I still manage my risks, no matter how big the potential reward is, and how little the potential risk may seem.*\n\nDiversifying and hedging are still very important. I know y\u2019all think diversifying is boomer shit, but when it comes to options it\u2019s important. If you want to yolo into one, at least do long strangles. If your erection is pointing towards a certain direction, at least do a 2:1 ratio for strangles (having a ratio of 2 calls for every put for bullish, or having 2 puts for every call for bearish). Focus on preserving what you have. An almost certain 50% profit a week is way more lucrative over time than a low chance of 300%+ profit on a yolo. Understand greeks and what they mean. \n\n**Understand that stocks don\u2019t move because of good news or bad news, they move because institutions want them to move aka low gamma (or not move if they sold strangles aka high gamma [keeps price action sideways rather than up or down]). They gamma hedge and delta hedge. They can literally rig the game by buying calls, selling puts, and then using billions to push the stock upwards, making profits off the puts they sold expiring worthless, making money off the calls they bought because they expire deep ITM, and profiting off the underlying stock they bought because of impulse waves and gamma squeezes from the people who sold them those calls.** \n\n**Don\u2019t complain about how the game is rigged, think like an institution and figure out how to profit off of it. If you want to preach to your politicians to fix it and change laws and make it fair, you will be wasting your time and energy and will end up broke and depressed. Leave that to the social justice warriors. Look back over the past decade. Social media is flooded with them. All that time and energy and not a single thing has changed. I know because I\u2019ve been there when it comes to complaining the game is rigged. It took years for it to finally click for me. And now I\u2019m making money.**\n\nUnderstand that and IV and set yourself up for success. If you use TDA\u2019s ThinkOrSwim, you can use option screeners to find options that are near the money with phenomenal gamma and IV levels. Pair that with research on current events and macroeconomics to figure out which stock options are the correct puzzle piece for the puzzle you\u2019re solving. \n\nBoomers diversify by buying stocks in all areas. Which is dumb. Because when one market goes up, another probably takes a hit. Those profits are very slow. This is very different. We\u2019re intensely focused on two areas, which are yields and debt. This week has a massive impact on those two areas, primarily the yields. We expect big movement either upwards or downwards in yields, that\u2019s why playing both sides works. Because even on the hedge, the movement that direction will be big enough to cover expenses and still come out with profit.\n\nI\u2019ve been on WSB for years. This account has only been posting here for about a year and a half, but I had another Reddit i deleted when I was in the market for a new job. I know some of the OGs here will roast you for not taking the route of high risk high reward. It\u2019s the culture that\u2019s been here, and will always be here. Loss porn is funny, and gain porn makes you aroused.

I\u2019ve watched newbies get burned bad and promise to themselves that they\u2019ll never touch stocks again, and they don\u2019t. I\u2019ve watched newbies get burned so bad and become depressed, and their posts signal a call for help. I lost four close friends to suicide my final year of college in 2018. I don\u2019t want that to happen to any of you. I want you to shrink the ranges of the highs and lows. Just like taking too much of a certain substance, those high highs feel very good, but when the very low lows come around, you realize the highs weren\u2019t worth the lows in the end.

We like to talk about HFs like they\u2019re monoliths (note to apes: picture a giant, shiny, angular dildo), but obviously there are lots of players working lots of angles in the GME saga. \n\nMy assumption is that retail investors aren\u2019t doing a lot of short selling; the hedge funds and investment banks are, and they have untold billions in their fuckery budgets. We have more individual investors, they have more dollars. \n\nBut while I have a rough mental estimate of the size of the WSB crowd, I have no sense of the number of institutional players. Recognizing that they\u2019re all encrusted to their come-encrusted titties, how many firms do you think are pursuing a strategy of heavily shorting GME? \n\nAre we up against ten firms? 100? 1000?","277":"NIO - Bull-case investment Thesis, plus Crazy OG-style WSB \"Bet\" Smart Nio investors trade on catalysts. If you guys read my DD on NIO before the NIO Day Catalyst, you would've bought in at 38 and sold around 60 (I sold calls, but still holding my shares).\n\nNow, there are two new catalysts that are arguably even greater than the announcements at Nio Day.\n\n**1) Energy**  \nOn Nio Day, William Li announced a second-generation Battery Swap station, where users don't even have to leave their cars. The stations are also a lot cheaper to operate, with greater capacity. They can complete about 312 battery swaps per day.\n\nImagine a world where Battery Stations replace Gas stations. What would that say about Nio? And what would happen to gas stations?\n\nWell early February, William Li met with Sinopec's CEO. Sinopec is one of the largest oil and chemicals companies in the world (2nd globally according to Forbes). They have over 30,000 gas stations. Here's the kicker: There are not so subtle rumors that Sinopec gas station will incorporate Nio Battery Swap Stations. Nio plans to have 500 battery swap stations by the end 2021, some of which may be at Sinopec's stations. The growth in revenue will accelerate.\n\n**Imagine if NIO's main source of revenue was from selling energy, rather than just cars.**\n\nIt'll send Nio's share price to the moon.\n\n**2) Hong Kong Stock Exchange**  \nNio plans to list in the Hong Kong stock exchange around April. XPEV and LI will also be added. This is great news for Nio's stock price. An announcement about BABA listing on the HK stock exchange (around November 2019) led to its share price rising from 185 to 300 in three months.\n\nThe same will happen to Nio, and even more so, because Li and Xpev's rise will bring Nio up even more due to their coupling in various EV-related ETF's.\n\nWatch out for an announcement in April.\n\n**Other thoughts:** I've noticed, increasingly, that puts bought for the purpose of hedging positions are now mostly be applied to index ETF's like SPY and QQQ. Why? Because GME's short squeeze drama nearly killed several hedge funds. Sentiment Analysis has become a household name, and all the major hedge funds track WallStreetBets to avoid stocks that are too popular. Nio is one of those stocks that boomer hf's realize is one of the popular ones on \"reddit\". Google \"top reddit stocks\" and you'll see Nio routinely mentioned (this is also why I think stocks like PLTR will no longer suffer for too long).\n\nAlso Mizuho announced a Nio PT at $60, and Deutsche Bank recently released a memo stating that Nio can reach $70 in the near term. These things tell me that both retail and hedge funds are united in loving NIO stonk. We might be clear for another takeoff.\n\n**3) What to Do**  \nThe dates on these catalysts are not announced like Nio Day was. All I know is that it'll happen sometime in the next few months. To play it safe, I would buy call leaps. My price target is 70-80 by EOY. Also, load up shares on dips and sell covered calls each time we reach new highs. I plan to diamond hand Nio, as I believe it'll reach higher than $300 in five years. I'll be buying\/selling calls, but not sell my shares.\n\n**4) Community Boost**  \nIf NIO passes $70 per share by eod, April 16, I'll donate to charity and post as an update. I don't want to virtue signal, but I hope it encourages some people on here to think about their community. I was inspired to do this by other WSBers that donated to the Food Bank with some of their GME earnings, so for that, thank you, and I hope I too can pass on the kindness.\n\n**TLDR** \\- NIO is likely to partner with the world's second largest Oil Company this year and have their newly designed battery swap stations operate in gas stations, thus Nio might actually make more money as an energy provider than a car company. Also, Nio will be listed in the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, which has helped stocks like BABA go to the moon in the past.\n\n**TLDR** \\- I'll donate to charity if NIO\u2019s passes $70 per share by April 16.","278":"Theta: God of Time and Death I don't normally like these \"options for dummies\" kinds of posts and absolutely don't like seeing them but I keep seeing people try to make a stupid person's guide to how options work and being **really irresponsible** about explaining theta. I have a few points I want to make about theta then hopefully we can put this to rest. I'm not going to talk about Delta or IV that's a different conversation and motherfuckers need to read.\n\nReal quick:\n\n* Not a pro\n* Not investment advice\n* Advice about how you need to actually learn shit\n\nIf you're too retarded to understand basic math or you're too lazy to try to actually better yourself then click the back button now. For the retards that stick around I'll include pictures and a fun little story.\n\nOkay about 3% of you should be left so let's dive in.\n\n# Theta\n\n The term theta refers to the rate of decline in the [value](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/v\/value.asp) of an option due to the passage of time. It can also be referred to as the [time decay](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/t\/timedecay.asp) of an option. This means an option loses value as time moves closer to its [maturity](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/m\/maturitydate.asp), **as long as everything is held constant**. Theta is generally expressed as a negative number and can be thought of as the amount by which an option's value declines every day. \n\nTheta is an estimate of value decay. It's a rate that's continuously adjusted. Every second that passes makes your option worth less and less. The biggest misconception is the one I want to focus on the most. We talk about it it terms expressed in decay on a day I think for our simple brains but it's not that simple just like days aren't really exactly 24 hours and there's complex reasons why.\n\n# THETA. IS. NOT. LINEAR.\n\nYou dickheads remember y=mx+b from middle school? that's linear. Here's theta on an option graphed for a 1yr contract.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https:\\\/\\\/www.optiontradingtips.com\\\/greeks\\\/theta.html](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/k3zpzuyfzvm61.png?width=474&format=png&auto=webp&s=359ec39cb38f082a8ca2fe69f7f562cf2ec441da)\n\n Theta is exponential. the theta decay on your option accelerates over time. Look at that last little sliver of the chart. See how sharp it goes down? That's 'FD' range. That's when all the value of the option evaporates nearly instantly like your wife's interest in you when she met her boyfriend.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https:\\\/\\\/www.optiontradingtips.com\\\/greeks\\\/theta.html](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/br6wnmc31wm61.png?width=713&format=png&auto=webp&s=63e4ca62032511a0b8e3ee2e43feed83b645def8)\n\n# Theta will eat your lunch\n\nLast week I had a C250 FD on GME that I had to close on a loss even though it was ITM. WHY? Because the rate of decay on the option was so fast that GME **wasn't rising fast enough to increase the value of the option and make up the difference**. Buying OTM and going ITM is good but it's important to understand that even IF you are ITM it still won't save you from theta and sometimes it's smarter to take profit rather than waiting. **You COULD even take the profit and buy the underlying**...\n\n# Retard\/Ape edition incase you're somehow still here\n\nYou live in Loserville and want to move to TendieTown. The distance is 1000 miles. You have 1 work week to get there( 5 days). So first thing you realize is that you can travel 200 miles per day and you'll get there on time. Great. Say you take Monday off. Suddenly you need to travel 250 miles per day. Not impossible but okay that's not a fun speed to move at. Take note it's a 25% increase. Let's say again on the second day there's no 'movement'. Now you need to cover the same 1000 miles in 3 days. Okay now you're looking at 333.3 miles. That's a 33.33% increase from the previous day. Holy shit now you need to fucking move and move fast. But let's say for one reason or another you, \"**G**ary **M**ichael **Edward**\" can't get out of bed on Wednesday. Still have 1000 miles to travel. Now you need to cover that distance in 2 days with an average velocity toward your goal at 500 miles per day. That's a 50% increase from the previous day. And on the last day you need to do all 1000, which is a 100% increase from the previous day.\n\nThis is a gross over simplification but it at least gets point across.\n\nDo you guys get it now? Every day without progress makes the goal much more unlikely because the burden just shifts and grows exponentially to the remainder of time. As the likelihood of the open hitting ITM increases and time passes, theta acts as a decaying agent on the price bringing it into balance.\n\n* Please stop reading option tutorials from plumbers \/ dog walkers \/ high school teachers\n* Please read about these concepts on actual investing websites and not the worlds Instagram of trading addiction or watch video from actual professional investors\n* If someone tells you they're not a pro\/ are retarded think twice about letting them explain shit to you.\n* Read a book motherfucker\n\nFD's made this casino notorious because people who were here well before I was started posting crazy yolo FD's -  who knew how acidic theta was and still bought and occasionally made disgusting returns.  \n\n\nGood luck everyone. I know all you are going to pump FD's with your stimmy so I guess just have fun and please try to learn how to read.","279":"Proof that HFs are lying to FINRA but that's fine cause they're \"self regulated\" + GME SI update. Back again with my colleagues derived SI, after it generated so much discussion last week (even ihor mentioned it) despite you fucks not being able to read. His replies to various feedback are below the data.\n\n**Short Volume Today (Friday 12th): 5,793,090**\n\n**SV%: 58.91%**\n\n**His SI%$ range: 690.8% - 1038.8%**\n\n**Daily Notes:** Oddly Slow day as fat call options expire as they were being boughten by the thousands minutes before market closed.  Extremely low Long volume, retail just holding. Off Market trades, bull instituations still carried us possible.

This means some weaks with low SV% had HUGE net gains in shorts. This never worked in reverse in the data.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/1j1f094h6um61.png?width=1031&format=png&auto=webp&s=c000f8086573c128e653722ed86117985e43b4cb\n\n**PROOF THAT FINRA DATA IS IMPOSSIBLE**  If you were to take the FINRA DATA from the 15th of january to the 24th of February, you would find that they would've needed to Cover using 30-32% of all transfers for the entire month and a half.\n\n*Proof 1: It would have been impossible for them to comprise that portion of the covering with the FOMO wave and GAMMA squeeze that was hogging the data at the time.*  This 30-32% is notable. There was a considerable boost in daily volume in that period. So, you are talking about a MINIMAL COST OF **34.46 BILLION DOLLARS** using my formulas from my previous data. That being the bare minimum amount... just to lower it to the SI% they said it was at....\n\n*Proof 2: We have not witnessed a loss of* ***22.65 Billion USD or more*** *from institutions in that time. That would have been a net loss btw, no bankruptcies were seen either*  I said above that I noticed that Short Sellers did not cover when the data suggested they had the opportunity. That this trend never reversed, a High weekly SV% yielded a net gain in short positions.\n\n*Proof 3: SV% has remained over 50% throughout the 15th to 24th period, which provides evidence of a net gain in shorts... not a complete dip of the SI.*  Lastly, if all this was the way they say it did, then...\n\n*Proof 4: The stock price would not have dropped during the period if they had covered. The data* ***HEAVILY*** *implies that shorts are used and held to stop upwards momentum*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**His Reposnse to feedback:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Short volume % of total volume can't reliably tell you how many new shorts have entered or covered that day because below:A market maker selling you a share that they haven't yet matched up with an actual seller but do a few seconds later will get counted as a short position momentarily. This apparently can and does happen and gets counted in the short volume. Meaning exactly no new short positions were taken but the short volume went up anyway. (I believe this is actually explained on FINRA's website -[https:\/\/www.finra.org\/rules-guidance\/notices\/information-notice-051019](https:\/\/www.finra.org\/rules-guidance\/notices\/information-notice-051019))  On the flip side, it does tell you the absolute highest number of short positions that could have been taken that day so new short positions could be anywhere between 0 and the high short volume amount, but due to the above as well as shorts entering and the covering in the same day means you can't really gleam anything from it reliably. Sorry\n\n1: What you are describing would create a net neutral movement on the share price, which was not seen.\n\nMore importantly, the data I aquired clearly shows that there was a net gain of shorts when compared to the long volume (which is where they could have covered) day after day after day. It is possible, but the data says that they have been creating more shares than they can possibly cover even if they were 100% of the long volume everyday (which, as we know, is 90% algos and day traders)\n\nI look at things from a scientific lens. All I aimed to do was to show that it is financially and numerically ***IMPOSSIBLE FOR SI% TO HAVE LOWERED SINCE THE 15TH OF JANUARY***.  It was the running assumption that everyone who believed in this had, and I provided damning evidence for it being the case.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>This is not how it works Not saying that GME short interest is X or Y. But literally this is not how it works you really can\u2019t use short volume to determine short interest.  INTERPRETING DAILY FINRA SHORT SALE REPORTS  Mods please don\u2019t delete \ud83d\udcf7 I\u2019ve seen a lot of posts about FINRA daily short sale reports and what it means. Importantly it doesn\u2019t mean what you think. This isn\u2019t FUD it\u2019s just how market making works.  TL;DR a lot of the short volume is market makers shorting to facilitate buy orders and they immediately cover with the next trade.  -High short volume in the FINRA report actually often reflects net BUYING. This is why trying to interpret these reports is pretty much useless.  -That sounds crazy but that\u2019s how market making works. -FINRA report is only for off exchange trades (dark pools). It\u2019s a myth that dark pools are all institutional, your retail broker is sending trades to dark pools like Citadel, Virtu, etc.***\\[14:02\\]***\\-A MM makes money on the spread between buying and selling (obviously). What happens is - your order to buy 100 shares of GME at market gets sent to a dark pool. The MM (a computer) SHORTS you those shares at $108.793 and then BUYS those shares back at $108.791. A short of 100 shares is recorded. This also explains how you see ridiculous volumes and ridiculous # of shorts every day for a stock that has a 50M float. The MM isn\u2019t \u201cgoing short\u201d GME. They short it for a millisecond then buy a fraction of a penny lower a millisecond later.  -So high short volume in the FINRA report (which is ONLY reflecting off exchange trades (dark pools) does NOT necessarily reflect high levels of actual shorting. It often reflects high levels of buying! Um. Like we just saw this week. Repeat that It does also does NOT reflect exchange trades.  You don\u2019t have to believe me you can read this super interesting piece here. Generally speaking, the idea that large short volume in the report is good news for holders seems true! It\u2019s just not for the reasons you think.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI didnt assume you were FUD, but it's a little sus when you open like that hahahahh  same as my answer for the last one, my data clearly shows that financially and data wise, there are more shorts being taken on most days, where the only way for them to even be below what they were on the 15th would be for them to litterally bankrupt themselves in the process.  What you describe there would have a net neutral effect on the share price. Share price plummetted as Short Volume exceeded long volume. That is the fact. The data disagrees with your rebuttal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>No, this post is misinformation. You cannot gauge short interest from short volume. Because a majority of short volume is closed in seconds. I keep telling people this. You should really make a wiki or sidebar notice about short volume. So much misinformation and misplaced hype because of short volume. High short volume does NOT mean high short interest.  To be clear, i believe short interest is super high for GME, but not due to short volume. There has been lots of legit DD done on this. But focusing on short volume is straight misinformation propagated by people who don't know what they're talking about.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. Same as the top two. Maybe try and actually take the time to read my the data I took hours transcribing and making palletable before waving it off and calling me \"Fake News\" K?   In conclusion: the data proves that SI% has gone up. The only argument Ive heard is the \"they cover instantly\" one which isnt whats shown in the data at all (its litterally the entire point of me showing Short Volume Overflow, to show how many more shorts there are compared to longs daily). If it were true, we'd have risen consistently as this theory would have 0 effect on the share price. What actually happened is they shorted it to 40$.\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPersonally, as in u\/moonski 's opinion,  the feedback from you all is excellent and whilst I am still sceptical of the high %s, and the *total accuracy* of the derived info, I still think it is very valuable in at least showing that reported SI is esesntially, total horseshit.\n\nAll we really have is S3 & FINRA delayed self reported data telling us SI is constantly dropping yet price action does not suppport such a low liquidity stock being covered from over 200% SI in January...\n\nAlso very weirdly the data goblin himself Ihor of S3 aka the iHorse (hes @ ihors3 on twitter ffs) tweeted yesterday that GME is a 10\/10 on his new squeeze score aka the \"squeezeometer.\" How this is derived  is \"a secret.\"  So it's 10\/10 squeeze potential yet SI is plumetting, at a mere 15% according to himself... mhm\n\nThus I am still totally convinced that SI is >100%, and this data shows that there is no way it is what is being report by the likes of S3 or FINRA is accurate. What we are doing here, if not proving to you what the magical SI number definitely is, is showing that SI is *substantially* higher than what reports are claiming.\n\nI am also certain GME has a significant issue with synthetic shares due to the volume of trading being a significant % of the total free float size of 50m (more like 24m in reality). AMC, a popular meme stock trades at 30% float, and most non meme popular stocks trade far, far, far lower than this in terms of volume \/ float.\n\nInterestingly I did come across this - SI was at **132% on Feb 8th**, according to S&Pglobal (you know, the guys whos name is in the S&P500) in an article posted on Feb 18 - [https:\/\/www.spglobal.com\/marketintelligence\/en\/news-insights\/latest-news-headlines\/short-interest-in-us-stocks-declines-in-aftermath-of-gamestop-saga-data-shows-62699063](https:\/\/www.spglobal.com\/marketintelligence\/en\/news-insights\/latest-news-headlines\/short-interest-in-us-stocks-declines-in-aftermath-of-gamestop-saga-data-shows-62699063). They later claimed on March 2nd that SI had dropped to 24% \"in mid february\" which makes absolutely no sense given price action - 132% to 24% as the stock hoves around $40. Ok then.\n\nSo yeah, enjoy your saturday evening assigned reading even though you can't fucking read.","280":"$GME and $RKT SHORT SELLING NOT ALLOWED ON TD https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/xctwvijejtm61.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc3f82e8786d22fc44d00b6f9114ed282f2b44a1\n\n[LINK ON TD FOR PEOPLE WHO DONT BELIEVE ME BECAUSE IM BEAUTIFUL](https:\/\/www.tdameritrade.com\/td-ameritrade-trading-restrictions-stocks.page)\n\n[See my post on GME and other stocks from yesterday which was very successfully buried and received little attention.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/m35u61\/memeageddon_judgement_day_witching_day_march_19th\/)\n\n**Brokerages are starting to realize shorts are in BIG TROUBLE in $GME and $RKT.**\n\nSo far $RKT shorts have been in COMPLETE CONTROL of this stock and it's price since they IPOd at $18 in 2020.\n\nIn Feb 21 RKT BLASTED away earnings expectations and revenue with growth of 161%!

Despite amazing performance, surprise earnings, dividends and buyback announcements the stock has been held under $24.\n\nThe stock is starting to be put on short-selling restricted lists which means shorts are over-risked and brokerages know this.\n\nRKT has a relatively small float with high short interest. It won't take a lot to light the match. The options interest for next week also allows for a big gamma squeeze if the price hits $29 for a sustained period. We're at $25... It's not a lot to ask for.\n\nDisclaimer: This is no financial advice.","281":"The Neurobiology of Autism and its link with the GME saga. My dear fellow apes,\n\nI couldn't find any thread discussing this but I believe this is a topic that can't be overlooked as it surely explains why many of us are bonding and showing similar behaviours in this GME \/ AMC saga. Plus, it may also explain why this is probably one of our greatest strength.I'm myself diagnosed Asperger myself and have spent years researching on the matter as I needed to understand why I couldn't feel and think the way my friends would. I'm sure I'm not the only one here.\n\nSO...\n\n# What is Autism and what is its prevalance in humans?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Autism Spectrum Disorder**\\- Autism is a [developmental disorder](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Developmental_disorder) characterized by difficulties with social interaction and communication, and by restricted and repetitive behavior.[\\[3\\]](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Autism#cite_note-DSM5-3)[https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Autism](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Autism)\n\n\\- ASD manifest in different forms and degrees. It can be low, mild, severe and isn't always manifesting as a severe mental disability.[https:\/\/www.webmd.com\/brain\/autism\/autism-spectrum-disorders](https:\/\/www.webmd.com\/brain\/autism\/autism-spectrum-disorders)*eg:* [*Asperger's syndrome*](https:\/\/www.webmd.com\/brain\/autism\/mental-health-aspergers-syndrome) *is on the milder end of the* [*autism*](https:\/\/www.webmd.com\/brain\/autism\/default.htm) \\*spectrum. A person with Asperger's may be very intelligent and able to handle their daily life. They may be really focused on topics that interest them and discuss them nonstop. But they have a much harder time socially.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Prevalence**\n\n\\- About 1 percent of the world population has autism spectrum disorder. ([CDC, 2014](http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/ncbddd\/autism\/data.html))\n\n\\- Prevalence in the United States is estimated at 1 in 54 births.

Take care tards\u2019","283":"Simplying Law DD series - NSCC rule 18 and GME Alright my first DD hit well, but I've got the impression all those after it are essentially not plain enough. I'm going to try and take a different approach and simplify as much as possible.\n\nNot financial or legal advice, any assumptions drawn are your own, hell I might and probably am wrong on things (have been before) and if I am, do your part - please tell me and I'll update.\n\nThis will be the first in a series and we'll start with a simplified DD on Rule 18 of the NSCC rules, as this forms part of the 'disorderly market' rule spotted where people are afraid the NSCC and friends will just sit back and let the 'participants' mess with trying to prevent the MOASS, ironically, for fear of creating a disorderly market their members already made.\n\nI mean we know they've already done that with GME as other excellent DD shows, but let's get into it.\n\nRule 18. This rule applies **only** when the NSCC declines \/ ceases to act for a 'participant'. OK great but what does that mean and what causes this?\n\nThe rule states the NSCC will cease to act should a participant become a Defaulting Member, or undergo a Defaulting Event. i.e. the NSCC determines that member either can't settle a trade based on their funds or made a really stupid decision or multiple decisions on a trade or actions involved in it. This means guess what? We block your access in the market and control your portfolio until it's resolved using this rule.\n\nThe list of who this affects is looong. Pretty much anyone with a relationship to the NSCC. For ease for us apes, this affects entities such as Citadel (member). Anyone can apply as any kind of member though, provided they are FATCA certified and have a Cybersecurity confirmation and get approved (i.e. many more than you might think).\n\nSide note: those we suspect are responsible for GME are still members. They might have gone through a Defaulting Event (January?), but as they aren't insolvent and are active in the market, it's safe to assume these rules aren't in play. Even if they get kicked out, this isn't FUD relating to payment if the market goes crazy, more on this later.\n\nOnto the rule. So the NSCC thinks you fucked up or you did, or both and you're either a dreaded Default Member \/ went through a Defaulting Event. What now? \n\nUnless the NSCC board says otherwise, on their notice being delivered, any CNS trade, Balance Order trade, Special Trade or Foreign trade, Long or Short position(s) for an OW Obligation that was entered for a CNS Accounting Operation, any cash relating to an OW adjustment and uncompleted cash ACATS transaction are the fuck up's responsibility.\n\n*Special mention: fuck Special Trades. Literally defined as security trades between members only and it's allowed. Ripe for manipulation if you ask me.*\n\nI know what you're thinking. What does any of that mean?\n\nThe thing about legal documents, they'll make up a bunch of definitions on the first page, which then refer you to many different pages to explain a definition. Then they expect you know what they're talking about 100 pages later to bore your ass into not looking it up.\n\nFortunately, I have nothing better to do. Or maybe I do, but I'm a retard. For ape understanding, this is basically saying anything you're on the hook for the moment our letter of bye bye is delivered, you're responsible for.\n\nOh no, does this mean they won't pay for the GME squeeze? **Nope.**\n\nPut simply, this is the NSCC's way of clawing back as much money from that member's fuck up as possible before paying the remainder of what they can't liquidate from them first. \n\nIt also states any net loss will be debited to the member, meaning they pay it first in accordance with their rules and get whatever they can when they're liquidated. Not only that, any sums due to the stupid member from other members will also be used to close them out.\n\n*This makes the SLD filing that much more pronounced in my view, as they think even this risk isn't enough to stop members making stupid decisions.*\n\nFor instance, all the following rules gives the NSCC the right to take control of that member's entire NSCC and friends holdings to sort things out. \n\nThe rule also states they will focus on settlement, not profit or loss. The **only** reason they will not just fire sell \/ buy is if they think it's related to fraud; or would cause a disorderly market to genuine market participants. \n\nWhat I think they mean by this is imagine Blackrock took out an uncharacteristic fat risky short position which dived, and then suddenly the NSCC liquidated their GME position on the bid and the stock tanked before the squeeze and allowed shorters to cover at low prices due to the low volume. \n\nYou'd be furious as you were affected by some third parties stupid decision. That's why they allow it at their **discretion** instead. They'll probably buy the shorts or sell the longs at some point, but they also don't want to cause a crash \/ surge in any stock.\n\nLet's face it, at this stage a risky, double, tripled etc down short position in GME would likely cause the NSCC to buy at any price, as they'd see what's coming and was only ever being delayed by their members if they hold this position, as they continue to eat billions in interest. \n\nPulling the band aid off quickly may be the better approach if you don't face the risk of becoming insolvent and the loss is theoretically infinite.\n\nThe rule therefore has no impact on the NSCC stepping in and causing \/ preventing the squeeze for GME. If anything, if a member triggers this rule I'd argue it helps it.\n\nTLDT: this rule is like the NSCC's version of an intervention for that loved one you know is a gambling addict. You take away their cards and cash, sell their damn car if you need to and collect owed money from their 'friends', and pay off the rest yourself until you get them paid off. Then, you never let them into the casino again.\n\nEdit: not even removing the TLDT mistake or the misspelling of simplifying as it shows I belong here","284":"Trading Tips for Novice Apes I scored me an Adderall yesterday and in my amphetamine-induced madness sat down and wrote a bunch of rambling crap about trading stonks and options for beginners. I know, let's let the newbies lose all their money and clean out this trash-heap, but come on, the paper trading competition is more effective than sheer stupidity. Anyways, here's some tips to not lose money, at least not as quickly as $800 GME calls.\n\n  DiVeRsIfY!\n\nOptions are great. No, not those kind of options, but options like how normal people use the word. Basically when trading it\u2019s hard to be right 100% of the time, so why risk your whole account by owning a single stock? It\u2019s dangerous because *you will be wrong* and if you bet it all when you\u2019re wrong, even if it is rare, you\u2019re out of the game. All the money is gone. You might even *owe money to the broker* if you did something really dumb.\n\nDiversification is sometimes laughed about, even by giants like Warren Buffet. He famously said something like, \u201cPut all your eggs in one basket *and watch the basket*.\u201d He\u2019s not wrong, but most people don\u2019t know what to look for regarding dangers to this basket. There could be a wolf about to eat all the eggs and we wouldn\u2019t know it. *We wouldn\u2019t even know what a wolf looks like!* My point is unless you\u2019re an expert at knowing market conditions, economic conditions, and are great at reading 10-Ks and 10-Qs like a wizard, you probably can\u2019t watch the basket very well.\n\nPersonally, I admit I don\u2019t know shit about companies. I invest in meme stocks that have high options premium. That\u2019s my investment strategy. My egg basket is, well, I don\u2019t know what it is, but it sure isn\u2019t something that has any business holding eggs. The eggs could be eaten, spoiled (there's probably an option expiration joke here), or be stolen at any moment and that\u2019s why I have multiple baskets. One or two of the baskets can get stolen\/eaten, and I still have eight more. I can and will be wrong, and at most it\u2019ll wipe out 10% of my holdings. I, and you, can happily easily take a 10% hit to the investment account and be able to function.\n\nThis play more into my next tip: be stoic. By diversifying you can remove extreme emotion from your investing\/trading.\n\n## Be Calm. Be Chill. Be Stoic. It\u2019s just money after all!\n\nYou are your main enemy to stock market success. It\u2019s not market makers, shorts, or other traders; they only use you against yourself. Why? Because you\u2019re a person. You have emotions. You\u2019re stupid and irrational and emotional. Money is on the line; you know the thing we all trade for shelter, food, good, and everything? Money is fundamentally tied to emotion, so when your money starts to get messed with you get stupid. Think of all the silly shit you\u2019ve done and said on an emotional high or low. You may have drunkenly told someone you loved them, kicked someone\u2019s ass, bought something stupid, and apply this to your investment account. How are you going to treat hundreds or thousands of investment money if you\u2019re emotional? When a stock you own (please be diversified!) drops 60% and your money disappears what do you do? You have a choice and emotion will only make the choice harder to make.\n\nI don\u2019t really have a tip here because it\u2019s something you learn to deal with. There is no magical key to not being emotional when money is involved (besides shutting your phone off and going for a walk), but just know that it is immensely important, more than any other thing, to keep emotion in check in regards to investing. I do have a few tips on things to be aware of though. Luckily they have names so by labeling them you can recognize what\u2019s happening and combat it.\n\n## FOMO\n\nFear of Missing Out. You watch a stock you were kinda thinking about buying jump 300% in a few days. People at work are talking about their hot stock that's printing them tendies. You start to think that maybe you missed the boat -- you dragged your feet and are sitting out riding the rocket to the moon -- or did you? Maybe it\u2019ll go up another 300% *if you get in ASAP!* Yeah, that\u2019s a great idea. You\u2019re not even greedy, you just want it to go up a little bit so you can feel like you were part of the moon mission, and that\u2019s not hard to do, right? Surely if it went up so quickly, it\u2019ll keep going up at least until you sell.\n\nWrong. This is a terrible idea. Hype is dangerous. FOMO is why people I work with are chucking money into \\[redacted\\] at $50,000 after it went up 1,000% in a year. This is why people are *still* bagholding GameStop at $450 per share. This is why a large portion of bagholders exist in the first place; their still holding onto their $18 AMCs they bought a few months ago no wanting to take the loss.\n\nIf you find yourself experiencing HARD FOMO and *just can\u2019t resist*, buy yourself a small portion. Don\u2019t go crazy. Don\u2019t \u201cinvest\u201d anything more than you\u2019re willing to lose. Using \\[redacted\\] again, if you invested $1,000 at $50,000 and \\[redacted\\] went down to $5,000, would you be fine with it? You turned $1,000 into $100 and how would you feel? There is a low enough point where it\u2019s stomachable, so invest that. I\u2019m not buying \\[redacted\\] but if I did I\u2019d be okay with a $500 \"investment.\" If I lose it, it\u2019s fine, and I won\u2019t lose sleep over it. FOMO is dangerous so be aware of it.\n\n## FUD\/Dooming\n\nThe opposite of FOMO: Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt. This can be caused by your family questioning what the hell you bought, news stories, internet shitposts, etc. and make you scared to hold your stock\/option because you're worried the price will crash. These pale in comparison to witnessing a beloved stock you owe totally collapse in price. You watch your thousands of dollars of gain disappear in a few days (or maybe hours) and what do you do? You panic sell. You're $10,000 profit is down to $7,000, $6,000 and $5,000 and *OMG how much worse can it get! I could lose all my profit!* You panic sell and realize a $2,000 gain, but oh how you kick yourself in the ass for not getting out at the top. You were greedy, you feel like shit. You're the worst trader ever.\n\nThen the next day the stock goes up and you get a side of FOMO to go with your main-course FUD. *If only you held...but maybe it's not too late to jump back in?*\n\nAs before, no real tips on this one. It's also hard to give tips for when something emotional is happening. It's easy to say \"*don't panic sell!*\" but when you're on the verge of panic selling its hard to detach yourself from the numbers on your screen and actually not panic sell. Only with hindsight do you realize how much of a paper-handed bitch you were.\n\nLike with FOMO, a good recipe for mitigating FUD is to give into your emotions just a little bit so you feel like you're doing something. If you want to sell as a stock is crashing, sell half. Sell a third. You don't need to sell it all and regret it later. And if you have truly massive balls, you can always *buy more shares on the way down!*\n\n## No Regrets! No \"what ifs\"!\n\nThere's few things worse than seeing an \"investment\" work out better than you expected but to not sell at the top. You're always haunted by the \"what if I just did this\u2026\" A stock triples, you don't sell, and then it's back to where you bought it at. You could've raked in *so much money* but you held too long and raked in absolutely nothing.\n\nThen there's the opposite problem: selling too early. You got greedy\/scared and took a 10% gain when you could've had a 1000% gain. This was me with *GameStop* in January. I had 400 shares total and sold them around $30-40. Sure I made $5,000 but I could've had $150,000 if I held on for another week or so! Try not to kick yourself in the ass for missing like that and tell me how well it goes. It's hard.\n\nAt least I didn't FOMO back in. I realized my mistake -- I sold too early -- and am trying my best to not let it haunt me. Everything is clear with hindsight and what I did made sense at the time. Trading is stupidly hard and no one perfectly buys at the bottom or sells at the top and as long as you come out ahead, who cares? I'm not the guy holding bags at $450 a share, and at least I was in the play and made some significant cash. As always, easier said than done, but try not to be too hard on yourself for not being perfect.\n\nMy tip here is to take profits as you wish. You can probably tell that I'm a big fan of taking half-measures -- selling half, buying half -- because you're doing something and doing something feels good. If a stock goes up 20% and you want to sell, sell half. Realize some profits and let the rest ride. If it goes up even more, sell half of those, and so on. This isn't a rule, just an idea. You feel good taking profits but leaving some on the table does wonders for the \"what if\" thoughts that might haunt you.\n\nThe same is true for buying. Buy half of what you want and see how it plays out. If the stock goes down, buy more. This keeps you safe from tossing in a ton of money at a high price, but makes you feel good for getting some cash in the game.\n\nDisclaimer: I like the stock. This is financial advice.","285":"IlLUMNated? Who Wins and Loses When Autists, Christian Bale and Tendies Collide? **EDIT: I planned to post this before LUMN ran 15% in a week.

I still think that. There has been some development in the stock since I posted that DD, and I think that y'all deserve an update. Because frankly, the pitiful DD I've seen on LUMN since, one of which references why \"Cables are like the future, man\", and another that had more emojis in it than a tweenage girl's apple chat, is well, unsettling. So you're fucking welcome.\n\n**Act 1: Dr. Christian Bale, PHD, MD.**\n\nFor those of you who are too retarded to read my first DD, what initially got me interested in LUMN was a [13F](https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1649339\/000156761920019679\/0001567619-20-019679-index.htm) filed by the one and only Michael Burry, who will henceforth be referred to Dr. Christan Bale, PHD, MD. As seen in the excellent movie The Big Short, Christian Bale is basically an autist who reads approximately 10 million pages of housing loans, and figures out that the trading of [Collateral Debt Obligations](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/c\/cdo.asp) on subprime mortgages was going to crash the housing market.  Dr. Bale then buys approximately $1.3 Billion of [Credit Default Swaps](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/c\/creditdefaultswap.asp), which is a kind of like a bet on a loan defaulting and proceeds to ride the housing market crash to tendie town.

I don't fucking care. Google it, or watch the movie. Margot Robbie will explain it all to you, plus she'll get your dick hard. (Or your pussy wet.

Remember that other stock that Bale invested in that helped put u\/deepfuckingvalue on the map? What was it called again....? Idr. Oh well. Moving on.\n\n**Act 2: A New Breed**\n\nOk, with that out of the way, onto the stock TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nLUMN is formerly CenturyLink. Most of you are young enough now to not know that this company used to be shit, and was a part of a dying telecom industry that provided mostly phone lines, and no one except grandma has got phone lines in their house anymore. And grandmas die every day. So, much like the cigarette industry, CenturyLink's customer base was rapidly dwindling. Unlike the cigarette industry, CenturyLink could not replace them faster than they died.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUntil recently.\n\nLUMN has rapidly transitoned to a cutting edge fouth industrial revolution company that is investing heavily in all the cool jazz that the kids love today, like hybrid cloud systems, adaptive network systems, AI driven adaptive threat recognition programs and advanced collaboration systems, which they have recently expanded with a partnership with [ZM](https:\/\/www.fiercetelecom.com\/telecom\/lumen-expands-partnership-zoom).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRecently, they presented at the Morgan Stanley Technology Summit. I didn't watch that shit, but I guess it went well because the stock rallied almost 8% the day after, despite the market collapsing around it. I meant to post this shit before that summit, but was too busy getting my ass raped by PLTR weeklies to care.\n\nLUMN is now trading at a cool $13.60, up from $9.76 when I first tried to bring you degenerates on board. Not bad for a boomer stock.\n\nOn top of this, insiders have been absolutely loading shares, you'd think this stock was [GME](http:\/\/openinsider.com\/screener?s=lumn&o=&pl=&ph=&ll=&lh=&fd=730&fdr=&td=0&tdr=&fdlyl=&fdlyh=&daysago=&xp=1&vl=25&vh=&ocl=&och=&sic1=-1&sicl=100&sich=9999&grp=0&nfl=&nfh=&nil=&nih=&nol=&noh=&v2l=&v2h=&oc2l=&oc2h=&sortcol=0&cnt=100&page=1), or something.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Act 3: Money and All That Shit**\n\nLUMN recently had their Earnings Report. After which, they got fucking obliterated. Personally, I think the finanicals are greatly improving. Let's discuss why, ok?\n\n* Their non GAAP EPS was $0.48 per share, against the estimate of $0.30 per share, beating the average consensus estimate by 37%.\n* EBITDA was $8.6B vs $8.9B in 2019.\n* Their net income improved from -$5.2B to -$1.2B.\n* Operating Expenses were reduced by by almost $570 Million.\n* Their net profit margin was improved from a solid -24.33% in 2019 to -5.6% in 2020.\n\nRatios:\n\n* Price to Sales .51 in 2020 from .66 in 2019.\n* Price to Book .96 in 2020 up from 1.07 in 2019.\n* Price to Cash Flow 1.61 in 2020 from 2.12 in 2019.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't understand what any of this means? Me either, basically. But know this: LUMN's evaluation ratios are knock any one of their competitors in the 5G industry far, far out of the park. They are a company with a $10B market cap that does sales north of $20B. For comparison, TSLA's Price to Sales ratio is 24.23. If you don't understand why a lower number is better here, fucking google it. Because I lied. I do understand the financials but I'm too lazy to explain it all.\n\n**Act 4: Forward Looking Statements**\n\nHere are some additional reasons why I think this company will make your portfolio super duper green:\n\n* LUMN owns one of the largest fiber networks in the world, with over 450,000 miles of fiber owned in North America alone. They also own the largest fiber network in Asia, where the expected CAGR of 5G Utilization is [46.4%](https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/in\/news-releases\/asia-pacific-5g-enterprise-market-to-witness-massive-growth-by-2024-as-mega-trends-fuel-industry-transformation-870296850.html).\n* Asians aren't the only folks LUMN loves they recently hired [Quincy L. Allen](http:\/\/blackmillionaires.blogspot.com\/2011\/08\/quincy-l-allen.html) to their board of directors, not only because he's a successful dude, but because, you know, #BLM, as the kids say.\n* Companies like AT&T and Verizon will rely heavily on fiber providers to expand the next wave of 5G, which, as you cool kids know, is the next bee's knees. There have been some unsubstanitated chatter of a potential buyout by AT&T. But take that shit with a grain of rice. Still, with how cheap options still are on LUMN, it's worth the gamble IMO.\n* There has been a steady increase in [Darkpool Prints](https:\/\/twitter.com\/darkpoolcharts\/status\/1364034343480545280) on LUMN since February of this year. For those of you who don't know what darkpool trades are, basically, folks with huge amounts of money will trade stocks on a private exchange because the size would otherwise throw the equity price out of whack on the public markets. Like, a lot of money. Like, more than you fucks who bought into GME at $400 have made so far.\n* LUMN is prime to drop a bomb in the the near future. There was a lot, a lot of attention at the MS Tech Summit and LUMN got some attention, as previously mentioned above. Options volume has spiked, and the Put to Call ratio is a respectable .14. Bottom line, not alot of gaybears in the LUMN camp.\n* There's a chance of a big upcoming catalyst at any turn with LUMN. However, I think the safe move here, and the best way to generate TENDIES, is leaps. For those of you who don't know what leaps are, they're pretty much the opposite of FD's. **It is possible to buy an option that expires farther than this friday, not sure if you fucks knew that.**\n\nAnd yes, Sir, I know this is a casino. **I'm giving you a sure why to beat the house.** Currently, an ATM option for JANUARY 2022 is $1.75. This is cheap, folks. Real fucking cheap. I've got options that have been fucking printing since December. If you're a real tendie tickler, try leap call spreads. Set and fucking forget. [For the price of 4 GME shares, LUMN could net you $25k](http:\/\/opcalc.com\/rlE). That's definitely enough to tell your wife's bf you're sleeping at the foot of the bed instead of a couch. In a year.\n\n**Act 5: Don't Eat the Crayons**\n\nOk time for some chart astrology you fucks. As you can see [here,](https:\/\/imgur.com\/YvMsoZy) we've got LUMN on the 10, hourly, and daily charts. For you robinhooders out there, there are things called candle sticks and technical indica-...fuck, nevermind. It's too complicated. Just keep yoloing your stimmies into GME FD's. It'll work out I promise. TBH it probably will you degenerates are a wild bunch. I hope you all make millions.\n\nAnyhoo:\n\n* The 10 is showing relative consolidation, with an arguable inverted head and shoulders, and had a strong move upward when RSI traded into the oversold range. there were multiple tests of the 200 EMA (purplish), 50 EMA, (yellowish), and 20 EMAS today in this time frame. LUMN held VWAP until about 10AM central when it dumped below it and traded under VWAP until it spiked up to retest VWAP after hours. A push over VWAP ($13.68) in PM tomorrow could set LUMN up for a strong pump at open for all you daytraders out there. MACD ended in the bullish\/nuetral territory.\n* Hourly is showing signs of a reversal if we can get strong out of the gate and get through the several levels of resistance: $13.19 at 200 EMA, $13.68 at VWAP, $13.73 at 20 EMA and $13.76 at the 50 EMA. RSI is still in the low to nuetral oversold territory at 45.50. MACD is getting ready to curl bullish and I think LUMN will be strong tomorrow. Volume Profile (not pictured) has strong resistance at $13.83, but over that we could get real fiesty.\n* Despite the daily MACD curling bearish, and RSI being in the higher range of overbought, I'd argue we're seeing a small bull flag on the daily. Volume movement also makes me think bull flag, but be aware of the general market sentiment and get ready to play both sides of the coin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOk Autists, you may be missing a chromosome, or might have an extra, or maybe I'm thinking of something totally different, but this one's a no brainer for me. Watch the price action and go long when the opportunity arises. Since my last post, LUMN experienced a sympathy squeeze from GME which drove the price up to $16.60. Since I'm no u\/deepfuckingvalue, I cashed the fuck out of most of my earlier posted calls because I paid pennies for them and sold them for dollars. However, I still hold July, November and January 2022\/2023 calls and spreads.\n\nThis is a smart play folks. Which might be sacrilege on WSB these days, but nothing will be unVALEd or turn PRPL in your portfolio and you will be able to afford to eat more than CORN. The only thing that will happen if you join the LUMN gain is green tendies and fucking caviar. #ganggang.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL:DR- Buy LUMN calls, leaps and shares.

EXPI provides many products, but most notably their cloud brokerage firm, eXp realty. Per yahoo finance: \"eXp operates as a cloud-based real estate brokerage firm. It focuses on the development and use of cloud-based technologies in order to grow an international brokerage without the burden of physical brick and mortar offices and redundant staffing costs. The firm offers offers software subscriptions to customers to access its virtual reality software platform through VirBELA.\"\n\nThe stock has seen a 52 week range of $3.26 - $90.00 and is currently sitting at $52.00 after hours post earnings (up ~13% on the day). Their market cap is right about 6B.\n\n\n**Earnings:**\n\nThey absolutely crushed earnings, some notable details:\n\n- Revenue increased 122% from Q4 2019 -> Q4 2020, with the result of a record high - $609.3 million\n- 15% increase in agents and brokers on the platform in Q4 2020 compared to Q3\n- A record annual net income of $31 million\n\n**The juicy deets:**\n\nOk, so now we have the background and some numbers, let's see why this is such an attractive stock. The competitors of EXPI include players like; Redfin (RDFN) - 7.91B market cap and Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL) - 8.96B market cap.\n\nBoth of those are at least 1.5 billion more in market cap, with technology that is far behind what eXp is offering. Traditional real estate brokerages can't even be taken seriously when comparing, because they lack the technology side of things that EXPI offers. Hell, EXPI literally owns a VR platform for creating 3D virtual office environments. Which that part of their business is not even remotely being reflected in their stock price. \n\nIt's more fair to compare EXPI to the tech startups that are upwards of 10B market cap. Looking at it from that perspective, we see a 4 billion dollar upside. Or a share price of ~$71.\n\nThat share price of $71 falls right into the 52 week range I stated at the beginning of the post and is what I consider an accurate value for this stock. The technical analysis from myself and others clearly shows this price target forming:\n\nhttps:\/\/ibb.co\/dL6brDg\n\nhttps:\/\/ibb.co\/Sx16QGx\n\nRSI and MACD are both turning up after a long downtrend from the ATH (90 -> ~35). It found support around 40 and has bounced off of that up to $45 leading into earnings, which as stated before, were excellent. That caused the price to blow past the breakout area of ~51-52 during the AH session. \n\nThis ship is headed for $70 very soon. It is certainly not going to be a GME type event where a 1500% return is seen, but a 40-50% gain on a company with good financials and future is something I certainly won't miss. \n\nI'm not a financial adviser, I just like the stock. \n\nPosition: 61 shares @ $45\n\nEdit: I've got a couple questions in comments and dm's about the bear case. Adding my take on this here. \n\nBear case - \n\nMarket writes them off as a traditional real estate brokerage, e.g. doesn't account for (or simply doesn't care about) the value add that EXPI brings to the table. In that case, EXPI is overvalued at $50 and true share price is around $30-$40. \n\nI highly disagree with that view point, obviously, but that's the perspective I'd take if I was in a short position.\n\nThey'll need to continue to show growth on their cloud platform(s) to invalidate the above thesis. This most recent earnings was a great example of them invalidating the short thesis by showing 15% growth on their cloud brokerage platform and record revenue numbers.\n\nDouble edit:\n\nYou beautiful autists who picked up shares and calls during the morning dips are true retards. Some of you are already looking at 100%+ gainz.\n\nTriple edit:\n\nInterest rate volatility is fucking us. I sold off at $59 for some quick gainz and bought back in at $46. Positions now are 20 shares @ ~$46 and 10 4\/16 $60c @ 1.50 strike. I still stand by the thesis here, *unless there is a market wide correction due to interest rates.* Play anything in real estate \/ tech \/ growth very carefully right now.","287":"GME Frequently Closing in Whole Number (Evidence of Manipulation through Statistical Analysis) Recently, I started noticing something odd with GME's closing price.

In this edition of DDDD (Data-Driven DD), we\u2019ll be taking a look at why the 10-year interest rate is important, how it has led to rising asset prices over the past few decades (i.e. creating an asset bubble), and how GME is involved with all of this.\n\n*Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion and for ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY.

Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*\n\nThis DDDD recycles a bit of content from some other DDDDs I\u2019ve previously posted, connecting the dots between some of the other topics covered in them; so if you\u2019re especially bored and want to learn more about things talked about in this post, check them out!\n\n[The 2010-2020 Liquidity-Fueled Asset Bubble](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/ghcfn5\/dddd_the_20102020_liquidityfueled_asset_bubble\/)\n\n[Cycles & Human History](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/gqgwfg\/dddd_cycles_and_human_history\/)\n\n[Ray Dalio\u2019s Thesis](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/hhrkwu\/a_smooth_brained_guide_to_ray_dalios_thesis\/)\n\n**What is the 10-year US treasury and why is the yield so important?**\n\nThe 10 year treasury is an IOU sold by the US government when it needs to borrow money, promising to pay it back in 10 years with regular interest payment in the meantime. They auction off these bonds to the highest bidder, and the price that these bonds get sold off at determines the yield of these bonds. In finance, US bonds are considered to be a risk-free asset, since it\u2019s the safest possible investment anyone can make (at least in theory). Because of this, the 10 year US bond yield is considered to be the \u201crisk free rate\u201d for any long-term investments and acts as gravity towards any other riskier investments.\n\n**Why does the 10-year affect the price of every other asset?**\n\nAs a rule of thumb, the riskier an asset is, the higher return (or yield) that asset will need to provide. For things like bonds, are pretty straight-forward - it\u2019s the yield, or effective interest rate that bond provides. For things like equities (stocks), it\u2019s a bit more complicated. As a hand-wavy approach, a lot of people use Earnings, so let\u2019s go with that. % return demanded by investors = earnings \/ price, meaning price is inversely proportional to % return, or **if % return demanded \ud83d\udcc8 price \ud83d\udcc9** **and vice versa**.\n\nThis is how the treasury yields affect the price of literally everything else (except GME), from real estate to SPY. Suppose that JPow decided overnight that he changed his mind and managed to pump up the 10-year rate to 10%, which is where it was at for most of the 1980s. Compared to SPY, which is maybe giving you a return of 2.5% (based on the current PE ratio of 40), any \ud83e\udd8d with more than two brain cells can figure out the better deal. So everyone sells their SPY and loads up on treasuries until SPY drops enough (i.e. falls 75%) to at very least match the return of the 10-year, and likely even more due to the increased risk and volatility (risk premium).\n\n[S&P 500 Earnings Yield vs. 10Y Treasury Yield](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/pg68b4n39hm61.png?width=1450&format=png&auto=webp&s=457e43c3379aa0cef7424de824904d2c8f66e556)\n\nThere\u2019s several other mechanisms that this rate affects various asset prices as well\n\n1. Housing prices - For the same reasons, a rise in the 10-year = a rise in mortgage rates. So if the prime mortgage rate doubles from 3% (today) to 6%, to buy the same $250K house, a 30-year mortgage will go from a $1000 monthly payment to a $1500 monthly payment, which might be more than what people looking at $250K houses can afford. This would thus cause a decline in housing prices until the people who would\u2019ve previously bought those houses can afford it again.\n2. Stock buybacks - A low 10-year = low corporate bond yields = incentivizes businesses to take on the cheap debt, even if they don\u2019t need it. What do they do with that excess capital? Usually, stock buybacks or dividend payments, which drives up their own stock prices - something executives are especially incentivized to do since their compensation is usually tied to stock price performance. What happens when the 10-year and corporate bond interest rates go back up? Those companies who took on a bunch of debt probably won\u2019t refinance their bonds when they expire, and will need to divert their resources from dividend and stock buybacks to paying down their debt, possibly even issuing more shares to raise capital to pay it back, lowering their stock price.\n3. Leverage - Treasury rates set the bar for the lowest interest rates someone can borrow at, including hedge funds to borrow cash to buy stocks on margin. To dumb it down, if a hedge fund finds some combination of trades that yield a 5% return with low risk and can borrow from their broker at 2%, they could lever up 10x (theyre not subject to the 2x leverage limit retail investors have) and get a 50% return while paying 20% in interest. What happens when treasury rates go up, causing their interest rates they pay to their brokerage go up? They sell those holdings, and since most funds are net-bullish on the market, this usually means a mass sell-off in the stock market.\n\n**How the Fed controls the 10-year yield**\n\nThe Fed\u2019s official mission is to\n\n1. Ensure price stability, this usually means that they target a 2% inflation rate\n2. Try to achieve \u201cfull employment\u201d, which is basically the lowest unemployment rate that's practically achievable\n\nThey achieve this through two mechanisms.\n\n1. The Fed Funds Rate - This is what they use during normal times. This is basically the interest rates the banks within the Federal Reserve System lends to each other overnight, which they can set a ceiling and floor to by establishing a rate that any bank can borrow or lend the Fed at any time\n2. Quantitative Easing \/ Tightening - This is an unconventional tool they usually resort to once the Fed Funds Rate reaches zero (for Easing) to further stimulate the economy to further pump liquidity by directly buying Treasuries \/ government bonds, and sometimes other assets like Mortgage Backed Securities and Corporate Bonds.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty obvious from above how the Fed can affect the 10-year note, especially with quantitative easing, where they might directly buy it, causing the price to decrease from an increased demand and reducing the yield as a result.\n\n**What Happened Last Week**\n\nSo what happened with the 10-year yield last week? It **\ud83d\ude80 \ud83c\udf1d**, which for reasons mentioned above, means that everything else **\ud83d\udcc9.**\n\n[10Y Treasury Yield, Daily](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/luroj2b79hm61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ad89ea67d4e86e555d39008d51d5cdc8fa8ec0d)\n\n*Why did the 10-year yield* ***\ud83d\ude80 \ud83c\udf1d***\\*?\\*\n\nBasically, there was a lot of speculation recently that we might see inflation as the economy opens up.\n\n*Why does the economy reopening = inflation?*\n\nThere\u2019s this macroeconomic theory called the Quantity Theory of Money - ***MV = PQ***, where M is the quantity of Money in the system, V is the velocity of money, P is the price level, and Q is the GDP. A rise in P = inflation.\n\nIn this equation, the key variable is the velocity of money, which is the speed at which money circulates in an economy, or in other words, how fast consumers will spend a dollar once they earn it. Interestingly enough, ever since the 2000s, and especially after the 2008 recession, velocity of money has been steadily declining, mostly due to rising income inequality as richer people tend to spend money less quickly than poorer people who might be living paycheck to paycheck. However, when COVID hit, it really \ud83d\udcc9 fast.\u200b\n\n[Velocity of M2 Money](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/j7mi0ed99hm61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=34d61275d0dc17bfbd82e6a16c3dc7beb1751a0e)\n\nSo with Q (GDP) and M (Money Supply) being equal, this would generally mean P going down as well, or in other words, deflation - the Fed\u2019s worst nightmare. How do central banks combat this? By increasing M proportionally to the decrease in V.\n\n[M2 Money Stock](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/hdg62w7b9hm61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=78de5d86fb81951af79939159662a0a442dc28dc)\n\n*By what mechanism does the Fed increase M?*\n\nUsing the two mechanisms described above. Right when COVID hit, they immediately dropped the Fed Funds Rate to 0. They quickly realized that wasn\u2019t enough, and started buying government and corporate bonds on-mass until they were confident it would prevent deflation. This has the side-effect of decreasing the 10-year yield, and making all other assets go up. If you look closely, though you\u2019ll see that they really turned off the printing press after the summer.\n\nSo, what happens when the economy opens back up? V goes up, maybe back to normal. So the Fed has two options according to the Quantity Theory of Money\n\n1. Let M (money supply) stay where it is. This means that P will go up, or in other words, inflation\n2. Prevent inflation by decreasing M. This will have the opposite effect of what was described above, and sending the 10-year yields \ud83d\udcc8 and all asset prices **\ud83d\udcc9**\n\n[Fed Balance Sheet](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/h9buyb8g9hm61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=33fe1010414625a0fa585b18d144d4a396ec86ee)\n\n*What did JPowell say?*\n\nHe basically confirmed what everyone was thinking - **inflation is coming**. However, he did say that he was comfortable letting inflation go above its 2% target until jobs recover and the Fed achieves its second mandate - full employment.\n\n*Why did what he say cause yields to go up regardless?*\n\nBasically, people were expecting him to announce that he was going to turn the money printer back on and increase the number of treasury purchases to force the 10-year yield back down. He did not do that, which indicates that he\u2019s changing his stance to actually try to be careful to not overheat the economy, and that he might actually be worried about inflation since he went against what the entire market assumed he would do, and priced in to do.\n\nAt very least, this means that we probably shouldn\u2019t be counting on the Fed\u2019s money printer continuously driving up asset prices anytime soon. In the medium term, if inflation does get bad enough, it shows at least some willingness from the Fed that they may actually intervene and decrease the money supply - causing everything else to crash alongside it. Will it happen? Well that depends on how bad this inflation gets, and how bad the Fed is willing to stand by and watch it happen until they do something.\n\n**Why I am a \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b in the medium term**\n\nThe re-opening might force the Fed to do something that they haven\u2019t done in a very long time - quantitative tightening.\n\n[Velocity of M2 Money](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/8p3hqx7i9hm61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=205278bd73362c102770641b4f54c38d51543133)\n\n[CPI Inflation Rate](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/yrhmwgri9hm61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=3dfb5226811e57354406cc24bcd51b34d685c882)\n\n[Fed Funds Rate](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/yu9fv9aj9hm61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=d5c7370b4d7999b623f05b65e5e789b21511e764)\n\n[3 Month Treasury Yield](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/1rsq9aqj9hm61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=779e5c7ed33361b74878209a80dc2fa41c849834)\n\n[10Y Treasury Yield](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/arepvz9k9hm61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=280e9c6de172228942c2a790a35baea3b3ec547b)\n\n[S&P 500 Shiller PE Ratio](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/hi6hz5uk9hm61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2d019a99e2b2f52df0cf4941fb4015a673a9652)\n\n[Rent to Housing Price Ratio](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/aexotxbl9hm61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=a0eac41c1f1b2c0f9e11284b9459b19804d03949)\n\n[Hedge Fund Gross Leverage](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/0jjgz0wl9hm61.png?width=1448&format=png&auto=webp&s=f583482a4f461048f961e89158a1413121de37c2)\n\nIf you look closely at these charts, you can put yourself in the shoes of the Fed and see why stonks only went \ud83d\udcc8 in the past decade.\n\n* The 2008 recession caused a permanent decline in velocity of money that has never actually really recovered - likely due to the increased income inequality that never reversed since then\n* Decreased velocity of money = decreased P, or deflation, in the long term with all things equal\n* To avoid this, the Fed drops the Fed Funds rate to 0, followed by quantitative easing on treasuries, dropping their yield as well, to increase the money supply to keep the inflation rate near their target\n* Since velocity of money never really recovered, they just left the money they pumped in and the low interest rates they set at the 2008 recession there and barely touched it until 2017, where they slowly raised it until they abruptly stopped in 2018 - we\u2019ll get to what happened when they did that in a bit\n* With all this extra liquidity in the system keeping the 10-year low, when the economy did eventually recover from the 2008 recession, all asset prices, including the stock market and real estate prices **\ud83d\ude80 \ud83c\udf1d** for virtually every year - except for 2018 - we\u2019ll also get to that in a bit\n\n**What Happened in 2018?**\n\n[SPY, near 2018](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/efjhgufw9hm61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e99c92f0e9f22bf26f2f8bf17e9c740021b6c27)\n\n[Fed Funds Rate, near 2018](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/woz6w4ww9hm61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=e539f1f4ef0ea0a96a90e0c59dd766b603087ff1)\n\nThroughout 2017, but especially in 2018, the Fed finally decided to slowly start increasing the Fed Funds rate back up from basically 0%, almost 10 years after the 2008 recession; the first quantitative tightening we\u2019ve since then. So, what happened in 2018? First, the [yield curve inverted](https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2019\/03\/25\/the-us-bond-yield-curve-has-inverted-heres-what-it-means.html) (meaning the 10 year yield fell below the 3 month yield), possibly the most reliable forward indicator of an oncoming recession - in the past 50 years, every recession has happened within 2 years of a yield curve inversion, and every yield curve inversion has been followed by a recession within 2 years except for one false positive. This is usually a signal of lack of confidence in investors in asset prices, which in turn caused the stock market to crash, leading to one of the only >1% decline year in the S&P500 since 2009.\n\nSo my thesis for is that in the next few years, one of the following must happen\n\n* Velocity of Money never recovers to pre-COVID levels. TBH this is probably the best case scenario for the stock market, but is probably REALLY bad for the economy. The only way for this to really happen is we remain in a K-shaped recovery, where we continue to have high-unemployment for lower paying jobs and high income inequality\n* Velocity of Money recovers to near pre-COVID levels, the Fed either continues quantitative easing or does not do quantitative tightening. This will eventually lead to inflation well above the Fed\u2019s 2% target. JPowell has shown so far that although he would accept this temporarily without doing any action but left the door open for quantitative tightening if he sees sustained over-inflation, which is possible (and imo likely) given the amount of money pumped into the economy over the year + how much the velocity of money dropped last year.\n* Velocity of Money recovers to near pre-COVID levels, and the Fed decides to do some sort of quantitative tightening in the medium term after seeing sustained over-inflation. If this happens, we will find out how much of the last decade\u2019s stock market gains were from real productivity increases, and how much of it was from the Fed\u2019s monetary policy.\n\n*What do I think? Short term, anything can happen so no I'm not buying SPY puts again. I am, however, not going long on anything outside of a 6 month time frame. Why? Ask yourself this - what do you really think has been the primary driver of the stock market's rise over the past decade: Fundamental economic growth? Or is it the Fed's money printing. Now, ask yourself, how long can that driver keep going for? The money printer was on overdrive the past few months to compensate for COVID; how long could this last until we see inflation and it forces JPowell to turn off the printer?*\n\n***TLDR; Stonks only go \ud83d\udcc8 if you have the Fed on your side. If the Fed ever decides (or needs to) changes sides, bulls r fucked***\n\n**Why GME \ud83d\ude80 \ud83c\udf1d when everything else \ud83d\udcc9**\n\nNot really related to the thesis, and [I briefly talked about this a few weeks ago](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/l9sh9e\/dddd_why_gme_might_next_week_and_how_it_could\/), but it seems to be what everyone talks about nowadays so I guess I\u2019ll talk about this too. I\u2019m sure some of y\u2019all have noticed that every time every other stock goes down, GME usually \ud83d\udcc8 and vice versa, and especially wrinkly brained ape [did the math](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/lteecj\/gme_may_have_the_potential_to_dictate_the_course\/) and found a statistically significant inverse correlation between GME and the rest of the stock market. Why is that? Well, in short\n\n1. Virtually nobody buying GME now is doing so because of earnings yield \/ they did a DCF on the company and thought that it was undervalued at $50 based on future cash flows, so the 10-year yield increasing is meaningless to them\n2. Institutions \/ Hedge Funds that are on the other side of the trade need to de-gross their books whenever the stock market goes down. In short, some hedge funds tend to take an insane amount of leverage (eg. the mean gross leverage of a hedge fund is around 8x right now). They can do this because their \u201cnet exposure\u201d, which is their long exposure - short exposure is much lower, and isn\u2019t as risky because they are \u201chedged\u201d vs. market conditions. Gross exposure, on the other hand, is the total value of long and short positions they hold. So, if they sell off a long position, they need to sell a short position if they\u2019ve levered up in this way, and vice versa. It\u2019s pretty well known that hedge funds love big tech stocks and like shorting AMC and GME. So, if they exit out of their tech \/ growth longs to reduce their gross leverage, they\u2019ll also need to cover their GME shorts as well.\n\n*PS - This will probably be my final DDDD, at least for a while.

Root requires drivers to download their mobile app that tracks driver behavior to inform the company how to rate your insurance. This is called telematics.  Before people start shitting on this company invading your privacy, hear me out. \nThere are several states in the West that are proceeding with social injustice legislation to ban the usage of credit scoring within insurance rating.  See [OR](https:\/\/legiscan.com\/OR\/text\/SB173\/id\/2236077) See [WA](https:\/\/app.leg.wa.gov\/billsummary?BillNumber=5010&Year=2021&Initiative=false) California already prohibits the use of credit scoring for auto policies.  \n\nWhat does this mean? \n\n Insurance companies rely on data to establish rates for all consumers.  If the state bans a specific rating factor (like credit score), the insurance companies will look to alternative data sources to increase granularity \/ provide competitive quotes for their consumers. \"Doesn't progressive already do this?\" Yes, the do; however, progressive is just one player in the game.  There are over 100 different insurance carriers in the West that write auto insurance, many of which are significantly smaller than the big boys.  In order to stay competitive, Root is going to serve as a necessary SaaS for the smaller insurance carriers to stay relevant \/ competitive.  \n\nAlternatively, the bear scenario is that companies look to build this out themselves, which would lend Root to be a very attractive acquisition target. \n\nRoot has very little debt: $209M\n\nAnd lots of cash on hand: $1.1B in cash and cash equivalents, and $250M in cash \/ investments with its subsidiaries.

Based on management's own conservative EPS forecasts (**excl repurchases**), a PE of 10 at mid year results in a share price of $144. This is the absolute floor target. They also announced unprecedented $2b in share repurchases for 2021, meaning they can repurchase over 16m shares at current levels. Their float is 133m shares, **BUT roughly 90% of that is owned by INSTITUIONS, leaving LESS THAN 16m** ***available*** **to public.** Assuming institutions continue to hold the majority of their shares (they will. it's a safe dividend stock), this stock will rocket by end of year.\n\n............................................................................................................................................................\n\nAs is WSB tradition, my one and only concern (a general market downturn) came to fruition shortly after posting the initial DD linked above. So my sincerest apologies for tanking the market over the last couple weeks. I'm now in your debt and, like a Lannister, intend on paying up. Continue reading unless you hate money.\n\nQuest presents a very low risk opportunity to double up at a minimum. No, it probably won't be a 10 bagger, but you'll at least be able to use the tendies to cover your taxes after $GME moons. **So here's part 2 of my $DGX callout (read part 1 first you jackass):**\n\n$DGX has been trading at roughly $11 PE for over 2 weeks now. The share price remains literally FLAT vs pre-Covid February of 2020. Which is hilarious considering:\n\n* All significant competitors are up AT LEAST 20% in that timeframe. Including Labcorp.\n* Back to back Qs of record breaking Revenue (50%+ y\/y) and EPS (100%+ y\/y).\n* A plethora of additional reasons from DD part 1 linked above, **including $2B in share buybacks announced and approved for 2021.**\n\nThis is practically a ZERO risk trade, which is even more incredible when considering recent market volatility. Since 2006, $DGX has only traded below a PE of 9 once....doing so for a mere 30 days. It has typically traded around 15 PE during that time overall. I know, I know. You're thinking *wtf is this guy rambling about historical PEs for. And he already said they are at 11. And 11 > 9, I think, so WHO CARES?!*\n\n**What if I told you that the EPS guidance given during Q4 guidance puts their diluted TTM EPS at 14.38 through Q2 of 2021?** To put it more simply for the slow kids in the back munching on crayons, if EPS targets are hit, then **$DGX would need to be trading at $144\/share to result in a conservative PE of just 10 by Q2.** If they return to 15 PE by serology advancements, acquisitions, base testing rush, and share buybacks, the share price would be $216. Key notes:\n\n* Guidance was only given for first half of 2021. They will beat the top revenue and EPS #s given. They ALWAYS do because this mgmt group is a bunch of sandbagging pricks. They were the kid in school that always said he failed an exam, only to receive a 98 and set the curve for the class. **Rev**: $4.85b to $5.15b. **EPS**: $5.07 to $6.07.\n* \\^ They. Will. Beat. Both. Top. Numbers. But my 14.38 minimum EPS above uses a conservative $6 projection anyway.\n* Additionally, management stated the EPS guidance given does NOT factor in an unprecedented **$2billion authorization of share repurchases, which is a massive amount when you consider 90% of their outstanding shares are owned by institutions.** For context, they seem intent on repurchasing **6x the amount of shares repurchased in 2020.**\n\nThe overblown trashbag \"analyst\" concerns remain the same from DD part 1. COVID testing will just disappear over night and Quest's core business will take a while to return.\n\n* COVID faucet is gonna get shut off quickly, eh? Yet in reality, public data shows daily testing remains absurdly high. In fact, the lowest testing day so far in Q1 is still higher than the highest day from May-Oct 2020. The overall Q1 daily average remains over DOUBLE that period as well. Heck, even Quest's own press release indicates COVID testing remains absurdly high through Feb for them specifically: [https:\/\/newsroom.questdiagnostics.com\/COVIDTestingUpdates](https:\/\/newsroom.questdiagnostics.com\/COVIDTestingUpdates)\n* Even as COVID testing drops off, it will be offset by massive returns in $DGX base work to pre pandemic levels. Personally, I think there's a strong case to be made for a rapid return in their base business as people catchup on postponed doctor visits and procedures. Small boost from employment screenings as well.\n* I've spoken with several Doctor\/PA\/Nurse friends across 8 different hospitals and they've said that over the past 2 weeks they've seen a dramatic shift in patients. **They are SWAMPED, but not with COVID patients.** This anecdotal reinforces the bullet above. DGX base business is going to return quicker than people think, AND they will still be able to continue a large amount of COVID testing (still happening based on the #s, just less hospital involvement thanks to drive-throughs and other 3rd parties).\n* The $1.9T stimulus package includes $50 billion specifically for \"testing and contact tracing\". The bill also references an unspecific amount for serology\/analytics\/researching viruses.\n* Quest also has seen a dramatic uptick in users on their tech platforms: Quest Quanum (provider focused) and MyQuest (patient focused). You can bet they will be able to monetize this data for research too down the road. In this day in age, data is everything.\n\n**Price expectations by end of year. Raises vs part 1 as I've gained more testing\/quest data into Q:**\n\n* Worst case - $150. Yea, I'm serious. Baring a market meltdown, this baby is a lock.\n* Best case - $200\n\n**Positions**\n\n* Sold position (2\/19 $130 calls) pre-earnings during run up for 400%+ return in roughly 3 weeks\n* Holding: $50k in shares\n* Open: May 21 $125, $130, $140.

I read over their February 10k and came away with a strong belief in them. Tanger seems to have a recipe that works with their outlet design and has made a number of smart consolidating decisions over the past quarters to ensure their continued existence while returning to Pre-Covid levels of sales and activity by January. Despite some claims that Tanger is the next GME I don\u2019t see that case. It has the potential to explode later this year, with May or August earnings providing the action that could ignite the existing kindling, but Tanger is definitely a long-term hold stock rather than an FD or weekly options play. I would aim for a price of $20-$25 by summer's end.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBelow is my overview, cons, pros, and what I see as a reasonable future path.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Company Overview:*** Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. and its subsidiaries is one of the largest owners and operators of outlet centers in the United States and Canada. They are a fully-integrated, self-administered, and self-managed REIT, which focuses exclusively on developing, acquiring, owning, operating, and managing outlet shopping centers. As of December 31, 2020, their consolidated portfolio consisted of 31 outlet centers, with a total gross leasable area of approximately 11.9 million square feet, which were 92% occupied and contained over 2,200 stores representing approximately 400 store brands. They also had partial ownership interests in 7 unconsolidated outlet centers totaling approximately 2.2 million square feet, including 3 outlet centers in Canada.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Cons:***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Getting fucked by Covid and negatives consumer trends related to their business model have made them the 2nd most shorted company behind GME:** The main factors behind their current position are that they have been fucked by Covid and the fact that they are at their core a collection of huge retail brand store fronts off the highway.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Tenant Bankruptcies and Defaults:** In context to Covid a large number of their stores were closed, some rents payments were delayed, and there was an increase in the number of bankruptcies and brand-wide restructurings by retailers at their locations (an increase in recovered square footage from about 1.75% at end of 2019 to about 8.3% of rentable square feet in 2020). Some of the tenants went through liquidity hardships and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. During the year ended December 31, 2020, Tanger recaptured approximately 903,000 square feet within the consolidated portfolio related to bankruptcies and brand-wide restructurings by retailers, compared to 198,000 square feet during the year ended December 31, 2019.\n\nAs a direct result of the pandemic, bankruptcies, and restructurings discussed above, the Company's earnings were negatively impacted by approximately $47.3 million due to (1) write-offs related to bankruptcies and other uncollectible accounts due to financial weakness, (2) one-time concessions in exchange for landlord-favorable amendments to lease structure, (3) reserves for a portion of deferred and under negotiation billings.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Most Likely will not Increase Rent:** Tanger\u2019s leasing team focuses on the marketing of available space to maintain Tanger\u2019s standard for high occupancy levels. The majority of Tanger\u2019s leases are negotiated to provide for inflation-based contractual rent increases or periodic fixed contractual rent increases and percentage rents. Tanger has historically been able to renew many leases at higher base rents per-square-foot and replace underperforming tenants with new or existing tenants in Tanger\u2019s portfolio. Given the current retail environment as discussed above, Tanger may choose to renew certain tenants or execute leases with new tenants at lower rental rates to maintain a high portfolio occupancy rate. This is some of their lease agreements include co-tenancy and\/or sales-based provisions that may allow a tenant to pay reduced rent and\/or terminate a lease prior to its natural expiration if Tanger fails to maintain certain occupancy levels or retain specified named tenants, or if the tenant does not achieve certain specified sales targets. Their occupancy at our consolidated centers has declined from 97% at the end of 2019 to 92% at the end of 2020. If their occupancy continues to decline, certain outlet centers may fall below the minimum co-tenancy thresholds and could trigger many tenants' ability to pay reduced rents, which in turn may negatively impact their results of operations.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Retail decline:** Certain retailers have experienced, and may continue to experience for the foreseeable future considerable decreases in customer traffic in their retail stores, increased competition from alternative retail options such as those accessible via the Internet, and other forms of pressure on their business models.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Pros:***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Tangers Model\/Outlet Centers:** Outlet centers generally consist of stores operated by manufacturers and brand name retailers that sell primarily first quality, branded products to consumers at significant discounts from regular retail prices charged by department stores and specialty stores. Outlet centers offer advantages to manufacturers and brand name retailers as they are often able to charge customers lower prices for brand name and designer products by eliminating the third-party retailer. Outlet centers also typically have lower operating costs than other retailing formats, enhancing their profit potential while also allowing these brands to maintain a foothold in high-density population centers without a high-cost storefront.\n\nTanger\u2019s consolidated outlet centers range in size from 104,009 to 739,110 square feet and are typically located at least 10 miles from major department stores and manufacturer-owned, full-price retail stores (so outskirts of major cities). Historically, manufacturers prefer these locations so that they do not compete directly with their major customers and their own stores. Most of their outlet centers are located near tourist destinations to attract tourists who consider shopping to be a recreational activity. Additionally, their centers are often situated in close proximity to interstate highways that provide accessibility and visibility to potential customers.\n\nThey have a diverse tenant base throughout their consolidated portfolio, comprised of approximately 400 manufacturers, brand name and discount apparel and home retailers.\n\nNo single tenant, including all of its store concepts, accounted for 10% or more of their combined base and percentage rental revenues during 2020, 2019 or 2018. As of December 31, 2020, no single tenant accounted for more than 7% of their leasable square feet or 7% of their combined base and percentage rental revenues.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTenants:\n\nLocations:\n\n**Perk of REITS for dividends.** Because Tanger is a REIT the ownership of the Company's common shares is restricted to preserve the Company's status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. Subject to certain exceptions, a person may not actually or constructively own more than 4% of their common shares. They also have to make distributions with respect to their then outstanding common shares and preferred shares, if applicable, equal to at least 90% of their taxable income each year. They froze their dividends in 2020 but reinstated them in early 2021 with a dividend of $0.1775 per share paid in February 2021. Because of this high dividend payout holding the stock at least gives the benefit of decent dividends while waiting for a potential squeeze.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Return from Covid:** As of December 31, 2020, 99.9% of total occupied stores in their consolidated portfolio had reopened, representing 99.9% of leased square footage and 99.9% of the annualized base rent.\n\n(Checkout Tenants and location attachment)\n\nA number of their tenants requested rent deferrals, rent abatements or other types of rent relief during this pandemic. For March 2020, Tanger offered all tenants the option to defer 100% of April and May rents interest-free, payable in equal installments due in January and February of 2021. Their rent collection rates on contractually billed fixed rents were significantly impacted during the second quarter but steadily improved during the second half of the year, as the Company collected approximately 63% of second-quarter billed rents, 91% of third-quarter billed rents, and 95% of fourth-quarter billed rents.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(checkout rent attachment)\n\nIn addition, traffic during the fourth quarter represented approximately 90% of prior-year levels and increased to approximately 96% in January. Governmental mandates effective between late December and early-to mid-February impacted traffic at the Tanger Outlet Centers in Canada, and excluding those centers, domestic traffic was over 99% in January compared to prior-year levels. This is a ridiculously good sign that there returning to pre-covid levels of demand even though only 20% of the US has been vaccinated. With a stimulus bill passing on the horizon, pent-up consumer demand,  and a planned influx of people traveling along highways and going to vacation destinations where Tanger has outlets I would not be surprised if they had stellar summer earnings. This would be the gasoline for a potential share price jump but wouldn\u2019t be enough to kick off a squeeze.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFinally, let's talk about what I think could be the item that kicks off a short squeeze.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Share Repurchases :***\n\nIn May 2017, Tanger announced that their Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $125 million of their outstanding common shares as market conditions warrant over a period commencing on May 19, 2017 and expiring on May 18, 2019. In February 2019, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional $44.3 million of their outstanding common shares for an aggregate authorization of $169.3 million until May 2021. After purchases in 2019 and 2018 the remaining amount authorized to be repurchased under the program as of December 31, 2020 was approximately $80.0 million. The Company has temporarily suspended share repurchases for at least twelve months starting July 1, 2020 as the June 2020 amendments to Tanger\u2019s debt agreements for Tanger\u2019s lines of credit and bank term loan prohibit share repurchases during such time and in order to preserve Tanger\u2019s liquidity position.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat does this mean? Tanger has a pretty sizeable share repurchasing power that is currently on hold due to their debt agreements from when they shored up their lines of credit and borrowing power in 2020. Because their share repurchasing power will be authorized until May 2021 there is a chance that at their 5\/10 Earnings Report they could roll that ability forward to this next year (2021-2022) and when their share purchasing restrictions drop on July 1st, 2021 they could announce a share purchase program where just under 5 million shares could be bought back by the company. This would provide the desired squeeze effect and really put pressure on the shorts assuming they don\u2019t take the time to cover between now and then.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Positions:** 111 Shares at $16.839, 4 poor man\u2019s covered calls for about $1050.\n\n(6\/18 $17 buy 3\/19 $40 Sell for $280, 1\/20\/23 $17 buy $23 sell for $384, 9\/17 $23 buy 6\/18 $30 sell for $105, 1\/21\/22 $15 buy 9\/17 $24 sell for $281)\n\n[SKT Rents by quarter](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/5ewr8rsq79m61.png?width=1576&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f3fddbd382b50f9aabaf6a0ebef784b078ebde5)\n\n[SKT Top 25 tenants](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/pyx88ewq79m61.png?width=1564&format=png&auto=webp&s=6ae283e23c7dae5773d90144914111413432f994)\n\n[SKT Outlet locations by state](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/6yk0lhtq79m61.png?width=1574&format=png&auto=webp&s=4403fa83fe2b584b8e74fd54928f18005410c2a0)","299":"Semi-GME Related: Jim Cramer's lack of Twitter activity Judging by his posts, he seems to have been undergoing physiotherapy for \"an engorged cyst that blocks your spinal cord\" (his Twitter).\n\nAll things considered, please don't mock him for his injury over GME.

If we win and be gracious while doing it, it says volumes.","300":"ASO: Early Bird Special Academy Sports is a sports and out door chain that saw 139% earnings surprise last earnings announcement and is currently the third most shorted stock at almost 40%. If you think there was institutional influence holding down GME, you haven't seen anything yet. \n\nASO has a much smaller float, 32 million, compared to GME's 50m, SKT's 90m, and RKT's 106m. It also has a much smaller average daily volume, compared to the other most shorted stocks, at 1.5 million. Although $40 options just opened up, previously the only OTM options were $25, $30 and $35. If you look at the last few weeks price at expiry you will see, for instance last week, that at expiry the price was just below $25 and immediately went up past $25 after the options expired worthless. \n\nThis is a company that had a breakout earnings beating both earnings and revenue and has another earnings announcement coming this month. Last earnings was so great because of the increased sales of guns, ammo, and out doors equipment from the quarter ending October 1. The last quarter of 2020 saw an increase in the sales of guns and ammo across the board. It also saw more school sports increase as states start to re-open. So far this quarter, which will not be in the earnings report, we saw the third highest increase in gun sales. We also see Texas and other states that are big ASO earners completely re-open. \n\nGetting back to institutional shenanigans. Not only do you see the price fall below the $25 call weekly on low volume trades, despite running up the day or week before, but you can also see price suppression daily. Look at the average volume of Monday's 13% run up, and then look at the volume it took to drive it back down to $25 on Tuesday. If you look at the daily chart for the past month you will see a roller coaster ride of 1-3% ups and downs hourly. Each time I've seen something like this it was either institutions \"shaking out weak hands\" or GME's first pop. \n\nI understand that most are diamond handing GME and it may have room to run, but I believe that not only is ASO over-shorted and will have another stellar earnings driving the price higher causing a squeeze, but that it is a fundamentally undervalued company.\n\nI currently hold 20 April 16 $25c, and 5 April 16 $35.","301":"AMC Squeeze Me Harder Daddy We the apes, in order to create a more perfect union, do solemnly swear to present to you all the due diligence that you will need to make an informed decision. Join me on this journey fellow banana chasers.\n\nTLDR; AMC is being heavily shorted; AMC has potential to go to $40  Time to save AMC and make tendies while we\u2019re at it. This is not financial advice; it was originally written in red crayons that I found shoved deep inside my nose. \n\nEver since COVID came along and kept our wives' boyfriends from taking them to the movies, hedge funds have been shorting AMC. AMC was close to meeting its demise on several occasions until the sound of apes screaming \u201cWe like the stock!\u201d could be heard. The sounds grew louder with the cult-like chants. However\u2026 one thing was missing: More Apes. This is where we come to you with the facts laid out smoother than your brain in hopes of showing you what could be the best investment decision of your life. Bananas will be flowing. Question is: Will you grab it or\u2026 peel out?\n\nFirst we will start off by reminding everyone that this is not investment advice, it is just the opinion of a few smooth-brained apes who like the stock, just like you. Now, why are we diamond handing AMC? \n\n**AMC has solid momentum.** To back this up you can look at the chart for this. The average volume has significantly increased. Months ago, the stock rarely had more than 10M traded a day. Now it's harder to find a day with less than 100m traded shares. In the same time frame, the price has gone from almost $2 to, at the time of this writing, $9.29. This means there\u2019s more interest and liquidity in the stock. All good things for us. \n\n**Theatres are reopening.** A quick google search gives you dozens of links for theatres that have already opened their doors and allowed moviegoers back in to enjoy their favorite pastime. Biden has [stated](https:\/\/www.msnbc.com\/11th-hour\/watch\/biden-all-u-s-adults-will-have-a-covid-vaccine-by-may-101867589951) that there will be enough vaccines for everyone by May, which will allow all theatres to open at full capacity. \n\n**Capital raised, debt reduced.** In January AMC raised $1.2b \u2190 with a b, in funding and paid off $600m in debt. Which leaves them with a clean bill of health and a solid ground to build up from.\n\n**Started A Streaming Service.** They have branched out into [streaming services](https:\/\/www.amctheatres.com\/about\/on-demand) as well, with AMC Theatres On Demand. \n\n**The Chart Below Looks Amazing.** First off, it's showing a cup and handle as indicated with the yellow line. This is a bullish pattern for price and we officially broke out of the handle to the upside on March 8. If we break above the tip of the cup, there isn\u2019t much resistance stopping AMC from filling a gap to $13 and continuing on to the $20 mark, which is where Vlad decided to manipulate (read:suppress) buying action in January.\nNext, we have the elliott wave theory that AMC does a great job of following. At the very least, AMC looks like it will move up from $9 to $13; on the smaller degrees. But on the larger degrees, if we assume that Wave 1 was the January spike, then we are in the beginning of Wave 3, which under EW Rules, has a realistic target of $30-40. With enough volume, AMC could easily blow past the $13 up to $20 and eventually reach the $30-$40 range. \n\nhttps:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ramEhoQ.png\n\n**Blockbuster movies lined up\/Pent up Demand.** With movies not being able to be seen in theaters, some have been put on the release back burner until they can get sufficient eyes to view them. Some of these movies include Coming 2 America, God VS King, Mortal Kombat, Black Widow & Tom Gun: Maverick.\n\n**The discord bot don\u2019t lie.** If it worked for DFV it can work for us!\n\nhttps:\/\/i.imgur.com\/nmbRPmi.png\n\n**Short Seller Data:** Forget about the momentum and the technicals for a minute and lets talk ape to ape. We did some research and found that there is still a TON of short sellers on AMC trying to take our movie theaters away. They just won\u2019t learn; we LIKE the stock; we LIKE our movie theaters; we WANT them to stay in business. Forget the technicals, AMC is a great buy & hold because it will keep a fundamental aspect of our social fabric intact. If theaters close down, where else will our tweens make their first sloppy moves? And don't you dare say microwave popcorn is better than the theater kind - yes, even after your wife's boyfriend reminds you he \"doesn't do salt.\"\n\nComparing AMC to GME, AMC is being shorted a lot heavier than GME right now; the numbers don\u2019t lie.  Take a look at what Harambe found: \n\nhttps:\/\/i.imgur.com\/w6WCJag.png\n\nSources: Data in table from Ortex.com, iBorrowDesk.com, and fintel.io\n\n**Fellow Smooth Brained Ape Definitions Key:**\n\n**Free Float:** Number of shares available for trade\n**Short Interest:** Number of tradable shares being shorted\n**Utilization Rate:** Percentage of lendable shares that have been borrowed (most likely to short)\n**Short Borrow Fee Rate:** The interest rate each borrower pays on shares borrowed for shorting purposes\n**Days to Cover:** The estimated number of days it will take for shorts to cover their positions\n\n**Harambe\u2019s Heavenly Thoughts:** Although GME has a higher percentage of its shares on loan, AMC has more shares on loan in total that are being shorted (Compare GME\u2019s 12M shares with AMC\u2019s 67M shares shorted). On AMC, the shorts have already borrowed 100% of the shares available to borrow, while on GME is only at 72%. We looked at the data from January, and saw a similar spike in GME\u2019s utilization, followed by a rapid drop before the price mooned. AMC seems to be setting up a similar scenario. Looking at the short borrow fee rate, it is now more expensive to short AMC than it is to short GME, which could increase the pressure on AMC shorts to cover. Also, AMC has a higher \u201cDays to Cover\u201d than GME, which means it will take shorts longer to cover, so the price spike could last longer.

With the returns from the market recently, it begs the question if the bull market is coming to an end.\n\n## Blow-Off Top\n\nA \u201cblow-off top\u201d is when the price of a stock or general market increases sharply, only to be followed by an as sharp decrease in price.\n\n>*A blow-off top is a chart pattern that shows a steep and rapid increase in a security\u2019s price and trading* [*volume*](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/v\/volume.asp) *followed by a steep and rapid drop in price usually on significant or high volume as well.*[*Investopedia*](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/b\/blowofftop.asp)\n\nAs a bull market nears its ends, the gains are too good to miss out on. As people buy into the market, fearing they will miss out on gains, it drives the price up to unstable values. Investors who have been in the market long enough, take their profits. As people start to sell and lock in gains, the price drops, causing a frenzy as others try to get their money out before the price goes even lower.\n\n## Why the Current Rally Might End\n\nThe S&P 500 had its longest bull run in history ended in February because of the coronavirus. After a decade of steady gains, things came crashing down in a little over a month. Now the market is back like it never left. The market is up 65% since it bottomed out less than a year ago. *65% return in less than a year!*\n\nThe S&P closed in October at $3,269. It closed the first week of January at $3,824.

Easy money means easy profits right? As more money has been circulated, it has found its way to the stock market and inflated prices. With more government stimulus coming there is reason to believe the stock market will react the same.\n\nAnd as we know, the stock market looks to the future.

Mainly because I wanted to find a value that is harder to manipulate then the most other trading values. Of course you can manipulate trading volume by playing stock ping pong, but that would be expensive over a long period of time. So I decided that would be a good base value to spend some time on.\n\nFirst of all I spend some time on daily short trading volumes, reported by Finra:\n\n[http:\/\/regsho.finra.org\/regsho-Index.html](http:\/\/regsho.finra.org\/regsho-Index.html)\n\nand filtered for GME. Here is a chart of daily trading volumes including short sales and a daily short interest line based on that. Starting on Jan. 4. (dates are written in Europoor style DD.MM.YYYY):\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Daily short trading volumes  ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/0icmss2b43m61.png?width=896&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfe593963525da81e8181da1c458a74a0a0ad09c)\n\nThis data set represents aggregated volumes traded on the NASDAQ, NYSE and OTC that has been reported to Finra. And can also be found here:\n\n[https:\/\/www.shortvolume.com\/?t=GME](https:\/\/www.shortvolume.com\/?t=GME)\n\nWhen you compare the daily trading volumes to the published numbers by MW:\n\n[https:\/\/www.marketwatch.com\/investing\/stock\/gme](https:\/\/www.marketwatch.com\/investing\/stock\/gme),\n\nthe Finra daily short volume data represents \\~ 50% of the daily trading volumes. So it should be quite representative. Now, if you think about it, what does a daily short interest of 0.5 (50%) mean? Imagine a market that is only traded by daily short selling and (re-)covering. Example:\n\n*Short seller sells 100 shares short into the market and buys them back later that day. Resulting in an aggregated short selling volume of 100 and trading volume of 200, therefore resulting in 50% daily short interest.*\n\nHowever this would completely neglect any other trading activities by other market participants! So according to different sources 10% - 25% of the market are driven by non institutional participants:\n\n[https:\/\/www.usnews.com\/news\/top-news\/articles\/2021-01-29\/factbox-the-us-retail-trading-frenzy-in-numbers](https:\/\/www.usnews.com\/news\/top-news\/articles\/2021-01-29\/factbox-the-us-retail-trading-frenzy-in-numbers)\n\n[https:\/\/markets.businessinsider.com\/news\/stocks\/retail-investors-quarter-of-stock-market-coronavirus-volatility-trading-citadel-2020-7-1029382035](https:\/\/markets.businessinsider.com\/news\/stocks\/retail-investors-quarter-of-stock-market-coronavirus-volatility-trading-citadel-2020-7-1029382035)\n\nSince HFs are heavy trading GME, I decided to go for a low approach of 3% of retail trading and an additional up to 12% depending on market width and uptrend of the stock, because these are factors that would attract day traders and long buying retail. For the period of Jan 28 \u2013 Feb 8., I decided to set it to 0% because of the trading limitations at the time, also if many traders weren\u2019t affected. I hope you can see what I\u2019m doing here... I try to keep the numbers as low as possible in short sellers favor!\n\nThat means depending on the market conditions the threshold line in the picture above moves a little up and down. The interesting part are the areas in between those two lines. If the daily interest rate is above the threshold line that results in a net increasing of shorts that day and in the opposite case the opportunity to cover, if it is below.\n\nBut we also have pre- and after- markets which are not represented in the data and are likely used to cover daily short positions. Therefore I had a look at borrow rates from: [https:\/\/iborrowdesk.com\/report\/GME](https:\/\/iborrowdesk.com\/report\/GME). Of course that\u2019s only an fraction of the available shares to borrow, but it gives a good impression of the daily market sentiment regarding tendencies to cover. So I assumed if there were new shorts issued one day and on the next day, there were more shares available to borrow, the previous short positions were likely covered in the pre- or after- market.\n\nSo, I also took that into account and extrapolated the results on the total trading volumes. I used the Jan. 4 short interest rates of Finra (260.91 % SI of 46,89 mil shares float) to start my calculations because I expected the whole \u201ccovering\u201d by options (\u201csynthetic longs\u201d and such; also described in this paper by the SEC: [https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/about\/offices\/ocie\/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf](https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/about\/offices\/ocie\/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf)) to happen after this point in time.\n\nThis leads me to the following chart of short interests which I use for a while now to get an impression of short interest rates:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Modeled short interest rates](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/sf4n1v8r23m61.png?width=890&format=png&auto=webp&s=d2b3ab27f6a3d0bbde92d2e77cfc0b39c498d574)\n\nI don\u2019t claim this to be 100% accurate but it maybe gives an idea what SI rates could be like. Probably is needs to be shifted a little down to at least fit the first 3 red columns. But trends in SI rates should be derivable.  \n\nBTW if I increase the percentages of non short selling and covering related volumes, the corresponding SI rates increase rapidly...\n\nOne can observe, that at the market stall on Jan. 28 short sellers began to recapture their positions. While they were really covering the days before. After that, a detachment of calculated and reported values occurs. Maybe because the models fails? Maybe because of the more creative ways to \u201ccover\u201d and abilities to dilute the float described in the paper mentioned above? \n\nYou could argue, that short sellers could cover by selling ITM puts or buying calls. But wouldn\u2019t it be cheaper to buy stocks directly? Besides that, if someone sells covered calls or sells shares by exercising puts, the majority of these shares are likely to be purchased within the period under review and therefore already embedded in the model.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDisclaimer: This is no financial advice.

I only wanted to sell a few shares at $500 to cover my cost basis and diamond hand the rest.  I called up their trade desk to see if they would let me do it over the phone, no dice. The explanation they gave me was that it is not their call, it is the market makers that reject the orders if they try to place them that far away from last traded price.  The broker claimed that the MM's have finite bandwidth on their order books, so if they allowed limit orders to get on their books that far away from the market price, then it could cause issues for people trying to trade at the market price like cancelled market orders and not getting fills at market price.  Since the MM's don't think that it's possible for the price to moon that quick so there's no chance of ever being filled they don't allow those limit orders to go on their order book so they can conserve bandwidth for orders they think have a chance to be filled.  Which, LOL, then why are you placing trade restrictions on 0DTE options and why does the option chain have significant volume at the $800 strike for end of this week?  I did test this to see if it was true both ways. I tried to place a limit buy for GME on TDA at $1 price, and it rejected that for being too far from market price.

So when you buy a contract, you are literally buying the *option* to buy or sell 100 shares of a stock.\n\nOn the other side of the contract, someone had to sell it to you. They are therefore taking your money in exchange for *maybe* having to provide you with 100 shares of stock if the price of the stock moved in your favor. \n\nThe black lines\/boxes in the plot represent the number of contracts 'open'. This means two parties have agreed to buy\/sell an option contract between them at a given strike price and expiry date. If the contract is open, that means the buyer is still waiting on the stock price to move in their favor. If it doesn't move there before the expiry date, then the contract is worthless and the seller of the contract made money on the buyer. The dotted black line represents the price at time of writing. \n\n# So what does the data show then?\n\nIt shows a ton of contracts open at really extreme strike values. Right now there is a huge demand for GME contracts, so the price of *any* contract at *any* price is high. It appears that people are buying\/selling a ton of put contracts at very low strikes. \n\nThis means two things:\n\n1. The people buying these contracts believe GME will crash down to these low values. They could also be people with lots of stock buying them to offset the risk if it crashes before they expect.\n2. The people selling these contracts believe that even if the price of GME drops, it will never hit these low prices. Because all options are expensive right now, the sellers of these options stand to make a good profit if GME stays above $20. \n\n[Huge number of open put contracts below $20, expiring in mid April.](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/uy9h07dp41m61.png?width=1992&format=png&auto=webp&s=989a1b58ecf02ca8da5bead1d4ccb85d970328a9)\n\nThere are also some call options being bought sold at very high strikes, but nowhere near the volume of puts. The risk associated with selling calls is probably too great. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Tons of open contracts at $800 and $500](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ytgw4m2k51m61.png?width=5859&format=png&auto=webp&s=a32ab80650692991e74b820dfd467dfa3da0beb8)\n\n# Get to the point monkey\n\nIt is my opinion that people or hedge funds are selling huge amounts of way \"out-of-the-money\" (low strike value) puts to try and make profit off of apes who think GME will crash in a month. It is also possible someone knows something I don't. Regardless, this information teaches us something interesting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ha78uxsa71m61.png?width=1753&format=png&auto=webp&s=df686f023a0b7a664046928aecdd49f2805b7690\n\nPositions: 3 measly shares of GME and 100 shared of VXX.\n\n*This is not investment advice.

This means an upgrade to our power grid  to provide more reliable power when we need it the most (i.e weather  extremities) with an emphasis on sustainability and being more eco  friendly (Greta probably approves) .

Its a meager offering but its something.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst off, I want it made clear that I have very little knowledge about data analytics and my opinions are my own and you may believe them if you would like.\n\nI've noticed in recent days that there has been much discussion surrounding PLTR about how they are a good buy due to insider selloffs, general market downtrend, Cathy Wood, Alex Karps Hair, etc. However there has been little discussion about exactly why their technology is such a big deal, and I believe its mostly due to people not understanding the techno babble on their website combined with not understanding the vague but nice sounding reasons listed by other people that coincidentally, also don't understand why PLTR is a big fucking deal. This is unfortunately expected since the breadth and scale of What PLTR's technologies can do is difficult to put into words, metaphors, or anything simple enough for you monkey shits to understand.\n\nI however don't give a fuck and so will try anyway.\n\nEveryone knows already that Palantir does things with data analytics, and organizes it or presents it in a way that **helps companies make better more informed choices.** so what's the big deal then? don't other companies do something similar?\n\nwell yes, but not really. The difference with Palantir is while other companies collect and store data, analyze it, and maybe create software that specializes in something related to it, what Palantir does is they take all that data, they analyze it, maybe make some software, and uses it to create (and this is extremely dumbed down) ***a virtual simulation of whatever you are trying to copy***. Palantir's capable of taking anything you want a simulation of, your network, your logistical systems, financial systems, entire business operations, anything that can be connected with large quantities of data, and makes a fucking copy on the computer that behaves and reacts like the real thing would. you can test ideas, check for problems, cause problems just to see what happens, and all while constantly changing and evolving in tandem with the real thing. If that isn't already enough, this simulation also is able to proactively suggest solutions to problems that are calculated to have the BEST POSSIBLE RESULT. This in turn, **helps companies make better more informed choices.** you see what I did there? the end conclusion is the same as what everyone else is coming to, but the problem is people aren't getting just how big a deal it is.\n\nIf you dimwit dumbshits still don't get it somehow, consider this.\n\nImagine if you worked at Melvin and Co.

They have differentiated themselves from their competitors by having their business create the fastest and most effective consumer to lender process to be qualified\/approved for their mortgage application and be provided the best competitive rates.  UWMC doesn't \"Lend\" any funds, they are simply the facilitator and underwriter. What they provide institutions, lenders, and consumers is a simple process they can use to apply, compare, and complete a mortgage application. Their system and software is proprietary to UWMC and institutions such as small banks, credit unions, brokers, and lenders use it because it reduces time & cost on a multitude of spectrums and the process is much quicker; meaning closing applications faster equates to higher revenue for institutions and Lenders. The whole process is completed through UWMC from consumer to lender, and provides enormous benefit to both B2C and B2B.\n\nYou look me in the eye right now and tell me you have a hard time seeing this? \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc40\n\n$UWMC \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nMods please make this a serious thread.

They control the majority of the ammo market in the middle of an ammo shortage, they acquired multiple failing ammo producers right in the middle of this as well. \n\nI think they are significantly undervalued and here's why; In this ammo shortage, when they're already earning quite well they announced that 04\/01\/21 the price of their ammo will increase 3-15%.

I was doing so fat sleuthing and ran across the stock - $ET, it reminds me of that little alien and while you all are posting rockets ships I want to be posting UFOs \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udef8\ud83d\udef8\ud83d\udef8\ud83d\udef8\n\nThis thing has a rating of strong buy across most large rating systems, currently sits at around 8 bucks a pop but has an outlook of 18! Obviously this thing isn't going to make you millions overnight (Unless you're putting in millions) but it will at least be a decent cash cow... Ahhh, Cows get abducted by UFOs I see what I did there.\n\nBut here are some stats for you apes\n\n* Projected outlook 18.00 compared to its current 8.04 at time of writing\n* Pays quarterly dividends of 0.15 per share at a 7.98% yield rate\n* 5 star rated across multiple platforms\n* Strong buy from multiple platforms\n* Currently acquiring $ENBL to increase their foothold in pipelines and lower debt\n* Assets worth 95 Billion\n* Debt totals 51 Billion (All long term)\n* Owns : Tufco, HPL, Transwestern Pipe, LDH Energy, Southern Union, PennTex, SemGroup, Regency, Susser and Sunoco\n* Biggest Customers are : American Electric Power, Center Point, Spire, Entergy, OGE, XTO, Marathon Oil, Cheasapeake, Tapstone and BP\n* Currently Gather, Transport and Export their own Natural Gases\n* Is set to be biggest powerhouse for Mid Southern US\n\nSo take that as you will but I seriously think tendie man is going to be paying me a visit this season.\n\nJust wanted to try and be helpful, you guys have been amazing and so entertaining, I seriously wish I could take you all out to the amazon and peel some bananas together.

Meanwhile, there's half a pandemic going on in the country because at least 14 states are planning to reopen. At the same time Congress wants to borrow a bloated $1.9 Trillion budget to splurge on hookers and blow.\n\nHappy times are here again...\n\nUnfortunately, the fundamentals of companies are starting to solidify and they don't need the easy money with the economy reopening. The economy has a government spending hangover and wants interest prices to increase before hyperinflation appears.\n\nHowever, Government promised a whole lotta freebies during the election and now people have turned up with pockets turned out waiting for their share.\n\nThe Fed decides it's not going to raise interest rates but fundamentals don't give a damn. Buyers don't want to buy worthless bonds and the government \"prints\" money by issuing bonds.\n\nA classic catch-22...\n\nCongress can't borrow $1.9 Trillion unless the Treasury issues more bonds. Investors won't buy the bonds unless the interest rate increases. If interest rates increase it becomes more expensive for everybody to borrow.\n\nBasically...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/i.redd.it\/0n9cfhbeg2l61.gif\n\nThe yield bonds are increasing on their own because of all the inflation stuffed into the market over the past year. All the hedge funds who shorted GME and AMC are now in trouble. All their borrowed shares just got more expensive to hold and there's nothing they can do about it.\n\nMy hunch is today's sell off is a desperate money grab to try to keep the GME price down to keep their interest down. (At the time of writing this GME is rising)\n\nBefore they were slowly bleeding out money. Now they've nicked an artery it's gushing out.\n\nTL;DR Raising bond yields means hedge funds have to pay more in interest to borrow stocks and they're doing a fire sale to cover their bets.\n\nedit: I can't spell.\n\nedit 2: The treasury issues bonds, not the fed. I was confused because Janet Yellen is everywhere. First at the fed, then in Citadel's pocket, now at the treasury. My bad.\n\nedit 3: Thanks for all the awards.

This little company IPO'd in December 2020 and basically for most of December didn't have much movement in their stock price unlike our little friends above who saw their stock prices skyrocket in the month of December.\n\nThen come January and February Pubmatic started getting some traction as investors started realizing Pubmatic's potential in this space, but the real reckoning came when they announced earnings on February 23 where they not only beat earnings, THEY **CRUSHED earnings** and they did one even better, they gave **SOLID guidance for Q1** and FY 2021 despite having little visibility into the back half of 2021.\n\n**FINANCIALS**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Revenue (In $ Ms)||||||\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n||Q1|Q2|Q3|Q4|Total|\n|2018|||||$99.3|\n|2019|$23.6|$27.4|$28.5|$34.4|$113.9|\n|2020|$28.3|$26.4|$37.8|$56.2|$148.7|\n|2021|$38-40|||||\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Revenue % YoY|Q1|Q2|Q3|Q4|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|2020 vs. 2019|19.9%|\\-3.7%|32.6%|**63.4%**|\n|2021 vs. 2020|**41.3%**||||\n\nLook at that Revenue **ACCELERATION** from 19.9% to 63.4% by Q4 and guiding for 41.3% which they will easily beat by at least a few points if not more (most companies guide with some padding).\n\n**They are also GAAP PROFITABLE**. Most tech companies are Non-GAAP profitable due to stock-based compensation which cuts into earnings, but this little company is PROFITABLE already.\n\nTheir Net Income Margin for Q4 was 33.5% which is incredible and for the year they finished with a 17.9% Net Income Margin despite COVID beating the crap out of this business in Q2.\n\nThis is a company that is executing brilliantly and has done so profitability as well. They also have really happy employees and a bunch of reviews too: [https:\/\/www.glassdoor.com\/Reviews\/PubMatic-Reviews-E256835.htm](https:\/\/www.glassdoor.com\/Reviews\/PubMatic-Reviews-E256835.htm)\n\n**VALUATION**\n\nWhen it comes to tech companies, given their lack of GAAP profitability, they are often valued on an Enterprise Value to Sales ratio (EV\/S).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Company Name|TTM EV\/S|Q4 Growth Rate|Q1 Guidance|Market Cap|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|The Trade Desk|44.8|\\+48%|\\+35%|$37.8 B|\n|Magnite|26.1|20% (Pro Forma)|\\+20-40% (Pro-forma)|$5.9 B|\n|Pubmatic|**18**|\\+63.4%|\\+41.3%|$2.6 B|\n\nPubmatic is growing significantly faster than The Trade Desk and Magnite and has a multiple that is at least 30%+ less. This makes no sense! How is a company growing faster than its peers that offers a product that has a ton of traction, and executing brilliantly valued so much less? If they were to get an equal multiple, this stock would be trading in the $90+ range at least.\n\n**SHORT INTEREST & VOLUME**\n\nNow it gets interesting. I have no idea if the sources I'm reviewing are correct, but this is what I'm seeing:\n\n[https:\/\/finviz.com\/quote.ashx?t=PUBM&ty=c&ta=1&p=d](https:\/\/finviz.com\/quote.ashx?t=PUBM&ty=c&ta=1&p=d)\n\nIt shows % Short Float at **32.2%** which seems like a lot to me.\n\nAnother article per TheStreet.com shows short float % at: **80.3%!!!!**\n\n[https:\/\/www.thestreet.com\/investing\/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-by-float-shorted-amc-pubmatic-tanger-gamestop-gogo?puc=yahoo&cm\\_ven=YAHOO](https:\/\/www.thestreet.com\/investing\/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-by-float-shorted-amc-pubmatic-tanger-gamestop-gogo?puc=yahoo&cm_ven=YAHOO)\n\nI have no idea which source is correct, all I know is this stock is incredibly volatile despite solid results. Perhaps it's due to it being a new IPO or something, but the stock skyrocketed to $76 before cratering down to $52 due to the recent market volatility and I wouldn't doubt that the high % short float, whatever it is, is causing that to some degree.\n\nRegardless, it does seem like a prime candidate for a potential short squeeze. If $RKT could double with a short float % of 38% or so and it being a $30 B company prior to the squeeze, I would anticipate a company that is < $3 B in market cap and doesn't have a ton of trading volume everyday, could see some potential uptick.\n\n**Wrapping Up**\n\nI think Pubmatic is a great company. They seem to be executing flawlessly and are guiding for continued strength and are in an industry with HUGE secular tailwinds. I anticipate this company will do very well by its own, but given how much short interest there is, this could be an interesting play too.\n\nDisclosure: Long $PUBM\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a financial advisor.

I then went back to dig for some real DD. Problem is, there is none. This has a P&amp;amp;amp;D feel and an ugly stench. I was bummed when RKT took off (without me on it and there was good DD on it) but the plummet got me hopeful that maybe some of the gains gets funneled into GME (I have a position). Which leads me back to UWMC.  It doesn\u2019t feel right. It doesn\u2019t look right. It doesn\u2019t seem right. \n\nIf UWMC is a hedge distraction, involving yourself only helps them.

This entertainment, not financial advice. This is just a \ud83c\udff3\u200d\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b look into the bond market and why you are seeing red and will continue to. TLDR first so anyone interested in taking a trip into the bearcave and coming out the closet on the other side can understand what's happening.\n\nTL,DR: The fed is no longer in control of interest rates. Stocks are artificially inflated due to the Fed injecting money into the economy with nowhere for it to go but to investments, with stocks offering the highest returns of all possible investments. This used to not be an issue as the Fed was in control of how much QE could be done through open market operations as they were the buyers, but as the money supply is now enormous coupled with rising money velocity, the Fed will now have no choice but to start the process of QT, but to do that they need to sell bonds, which they are struggling to do due to low interest rates. To sell more bonds to reduce the money supply they will have to increase interest rates, resulting in a sea of red and the\ud83c\udff3\u200d\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b's taking a trip to tendietown.\n\nPart 1: Macro 101 review:\n\nIf you are comfortable with macroeconomic concepts, feel free to skip this part. This section is just definitions for the retards on the short bus that flunked out of econ.\n\nFor this DD we will need to understand the concepts of money supply, money velocity, open market operations, QE, and QT. Money supply is the total amount of money in the economy. Money velocity tells us how fast money is changing hands through the economy. More info at [https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Money\\_supply](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Money_supply) and [https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Velocity\\_of\\_money](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Velocity_of_money)\n\nOpen market operations refers to the Fed purchasing or selling securities on the open market, which is one of three monetary tools the Fed has at its disposal, with the other two being the discount rate and reserve requirement which are not important for this DD. QE and QT refer to quantitative easing\/tightening, which is where the fed performs open market operations to either increase or decrease the supply of money in the economy.\n\nPart 2: What's been happening so far:\n\nNow that we have let the retards off the short bus, lets discuss where we are right now at a macroeconomic scale and how we got here. I want to get to what is happening with the bonds and I will try to keep this as short as possible.\n\nAs we all know, the Fed has been printing money like crazy since last year, with JPow money machine go brrrr. As a result, the money supply has gone through the roof since the pandemic hit, which we can see below in the M2 graph:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[M2 money supply](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/r3kdt4v2pyk61.png?width=1168&format=png&auto=webp&s=251465226f305cd7687d088ee853546ef116f3eb)\n\nUnless you have been living under a rock this past year, the reason the government has been printing money like crazy is due to the money velocity falling like a rock due to the coronavirus pandemic. If money velocity is down, people and businesses aren't spending, and if people and businesses aren't spending, the economy contracts. Hence the need to inject money into the economy just to keep it afloat:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Velocity of M2 supply](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/yqs9c8c6pyk61.png?width=1168&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4b140b90c74d9d2e229e6e72b2cb17631566537)\n\nThe primary way that the Fed has been dumping money into the economy is through Quantitative easing, meaning that the Fed will buy bonds and other securities during open market operations, AKA operation Bears R Fuk. This effectively allows the government to exchange existing securities on the market for cash, freeing up money in the economy.\n\nWhile the average citizen has been getting bent over a barrel with a vacuum attached to their wallet, the stock market has gone fucking insane over the past year. Why? Because for the most part, corporations, institutions, and boomers hold the instruments such as treasury bonds that are repurchased by the Fed during open market operations, which those groups and people then insert right into the stock market because there is nowhere else to park their money. Corporate bonds have been either risky or have low interest rates, US Government bond interest rates are garbage, businesses have been risky investments due to the 'rona, and only the stonks market has gone up. If we look at just before the pandemic to today, the value of all the stocks in the S&P500 have increased around 5 TRILLION dollars. The graph that shows this can be seen here [https:\/\/ycharts.com\/indicators\/sp\\_500\\_market\\_cap](https:\/\/ycharts.com\/indicators\/sp_500_market_cap).\n\nKeep in mind that the GDP shrunk around 2.3% last year and unemployment is still relatively high, meaning that this growth is absolutely not organic at all.\n\nPart 3: What looks to be happening:\n\nOk, that was long. Now onto the bonds.Lets think about what's been happening so far over the past few bear weeks. Bond yields go up, market takes a massive shit, calls on $ROPE increase in value, The Bearcave(TM) becomes the hot new club. Right now, yields have nowhere to go but up, and the fed has no choice but to increase them, thereby tanking the market, which we will see next.\n\nAs the money velocity increases as the economy opens back up, the amount of total money flowing around will increase as the same dollar will move faster through the economy, artificially inflating it. If we keep the money supply the same as it is now while increasing the money velocity, we will have a serious problem on our hands. This is because the value of the economy as a whole has not increased, so more money will represent the same pool of goods, causing an extreme amount of inflation. The money printer was good when the economy was shut down and saved our asses from a great depression part 2, electric boogaloo, but will cause inflation unless the money supply is reduced as money velocity increases.\n\nThe fed knows this, and are currently in the process of issuing new debt in the form of bonds: [https:\/\/www.marketwatch.com\/story\/record-414-billion-of-new-treasury-debt-issuance-poses-supply-test-for-shellshocked-bond-buyers-11614708102](https:\/\/www.marketwatch.com\/story\/record-414-billion-of-new-treasury-debt-issuance-poses-supply-test-for-shellshocked-bond-buyers-11614708102). This is quantitative tightening in action, with the fed now performing open market operations to reduce the money supply to prevent all that money from flooding and tanking the economy.\n\nBut there is a problem that the Fed is currently facing, which is that nobody wants bonds that have shit interest rates. To get people to buy their bonds, they have no choice but to raise interest rates. Time is also ticking, as the economy is reopening and the money velocity is increasing as can be seen in the FRED money velocity graph, meaning that if the fed doesn't raise rates, inflation will become a problem very quickly, and they will have to sharply increase rates or the entire US economy will be extremely fucked. As a side note the ratio of increase is higher in M1 than M2, which could potentially exaggerate damage to consumers. Unfortunately for the stock market, but fortunately for the **\ud83c\udff3\u200d\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b**'s who have not been hunted to extinction, as bond yields increase, money will flow from the stock market to other securities as well as back into the general economy, reducing the total funds in the stock market, causing it to crash.\n\nPart 4: My (Dance) Moves:\n\nPhew. That was long. Unfortunately, as of the writing of this post, it looks like higher interest rates could be around the corner at any time, and the higher they get the harder the market will drop as money flows from stocks to bonds and other less risky securities. To take advantage of this I plan to exit some long positions and swap them for cash as well as shares and calls on inverse market positions such as UVXY, SQQQ, and SPXS. Again this is not financial advice, and if you buy stocks that people mention on the internet without properly researching them first, you are actually retarded.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEdit: (not financial advice)\n\nHi everybody. It looks like my post gained some traction last night. As a thank you to those who have read and commented, I will address some of the questions and points people are having in this edit so they are visible to all.\n\nOne of the more common questions\/points is that the fed just won't allow rates to raise because they don't want it to.\n\nAgain like it says in the DD, at this time I do not believe the Fed is in control of the interest rates, and will quickly have no choice in the matter, no matter what daddy JPow says they will do. It may not happen today or this week, but it is coming. As money velocity goes up with the same amount of money in the system due to economic reopening, inflation takes off like a bat out of hell. If inflation goes up, the US dollar becomes less valuable, and if it goes up too much, the US Gov't will have exciting new problems to deal with. To reduce the money supply through QT the only real tool that the government has is open market operations to sell securities on the open market to reduce money supply, meaning that they need to sell bonds, which will require higher interest rates because they just aren't selling with the shit rates they are at now. The rates must increase to prevent widespread economic pain.\n\nAnother question is that why hold cash if there is inflation? Won't I lose money?\n\nThat may be true that your money will become less valuable if inflation takes hold, but you will have much less of it if you HODL during a crash or try to time the market.\n\nOK, now that some questions have been answered, bonus round:\n\nFirst lets talk about why the market crashes when funds flow out. The best way to think about the total market price at a macroeconomic level is through supply and demand. If we say that the supply is the total number of stonks in the market and demand is the amount of money in the market, we can see that generally the total money flowing in or out of the market is what determines market value, as the supply of stocks for sale is not changing a lot on a day to day basis across an index or a market.\n\nAnother thing to realize is that the Fed is between a rock and a hard place if you think about it. No matter what they do, there will be pain and someone will end up getting kneecapped holding bags. Loaning out money to get people to buy bonds looks bad, as it looks like a government scheme to con people into buy worthless bonds. Capping bond rates will kneecap and effectively nationalize the bond market, potentially sending shocks through the system. Do nothing and inflation fucks everything. Raise rates and the market gets flushed down the toilet. Rates are also so low they can't be decreased further.\n\nFinally, no matter what happens in the market, UVXY, SQQQ, and SPXS are currently at rock bottom prices. There is little room for them to shrink, but an enormous amount of room for them to grow.\n\nOnce again, thanks everybody and this is not financial advice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJPow Interview and bond activity update: (as of 3\/4\/21, 4:00 PM)\n\nInterview sauce: [https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/video\/watch-jerome-powell-at-wsj-jobs-summit\/10FF0DF9-C0E4-4215-8996-5E5BA991BBCE.html](https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/video\/watch-jerome-powell-at-wsj-jobs-summit\/10FF0DF9-C0E4-4215-8996-5E5BA991BBCE.html)\n\nUS 10 year bond yield rates: [https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/quotes\/US10Y](https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/quotes\/US10Y)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOk, this will be the last update on this DD before I let it ride and see what happens. After watching the JPow Jobs Summit interview, there are three things to take away, with the first two relevant and the third being very important. First is that at (3:55), Powell mentions that as spending surges due to reopening, the Fed will be expecting excess inflation. This is largely in line with and provides some evidence for my claim that as the money velocity increases, we will have inflation due to the money supply not contracting enough to prevent inflation.\n\nThe second is that for now, until the fed sees its goals met, i.e. max employment and price stability, or until inflation becomes a problem, the Fed will continue its policy of QE (timestamps 9:55 & 18:55). This will continue to inject money into the economy, so no big surprise there, but do keep in mind that this money printing will need to be continually managed through selling treasury securities back on the open market, so if there continues to be trouble in the bond market, that may potentially have an effect on the current QE being undertaken.\n\nThe first two things are not surprising, but the third big takeaway is quite important, which is that the Fed is prepared to combat excessive inflation by raising rates. At (13:50), Powell was asked about the market sentiment that the Fed will raise rates earlier than expected. His response was that the Fed will not raise rates unless the labor market is at full employment or if inflation becomes excessive. As of now, inflation is around 1.5%, and the fed has a target of 2%. Powell mentioned many times that they are okay with inflation being a bit over that as long as it is transitory, but at (24:30) **Powell also said that the Fed will not let inflation get out of control,** and was very adamant about that.\n\nThe third takeaway is important as when coupled with the the fact that the rising money velocity will increase inflation as well as the fact that the US Gov't is struggling to unload bonds, it seems to suggest that the Fed will soon indeed have no choice but to raise rates to prevent excessive inflation due to the large money supply coupled with increasing money velocity. The sentiment in the bond market seems to agree, with the 10 year treasury yield up by 8 basis points today to 1.564%. This is also good evidence for my thesis that money from the stock market will rotate out into bonds and other investments as yields have no choice but to improve, and again today has been another bloodbath in the stock market. If this continues I would fully expect to see more money rotate out of stocks, further crashing the stock market. See y'all at my new favorite club, The Bearcave(TM).\n\nAgain, not financial advice.","330":"\ud83d\udea8$SKT\ud83d\udea8 In case you missed the first post.

Options analysis, part II **Disclosure: This is not investment advice. I own shares of GME. I like the stock. This is purely my opinion and these numbers have not been audited.**\n---\n**Round 2**: Ding, ding, ding. Here's my previous [analysis](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/lspbb5\/gme_dd_analysis_of_options_expiry_on_226_and\/)\n\n---\n\n**TL;DR**: The data indicates that squeezes could be on the way.\n\n---\n**Analysis**\n\nCurrently: Roughly $227m in value, or 11.6m shares, (call-put) are in the money. \n\n* At each $10 threshold up to $150\/share, approximately 1m shares come into the money at each increment. \n* At $160\/share, approximately 2m shares come into the money.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSince rate of delta change is the highest around each strike price (meaning gamma is also largest). It would lead me to believe that a ton of shares will need to be bought to hedge these positions as these share price amounts are passed (creating a sequence of gamma squeezes).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**If price were to squeeze up to $810\/share (~56b market cap): \n\n* The net calls in the money would exceed the float.** This is insane! Even if calls were covered on the way up by buying the underlying, it's not possible to cover more than 100% of float\n* 8m shares would come into the money creating a huge gamma squeeze\n* This in turn would create a massive short squeeze (even if current short reporting is accurate, which is somewhat questionable at this point, there are more net calls alone that need to be covered to exceed float, which means shorts would be squeezed not just because of the price, but also because of share lenders calling shares. P.S. - Not sure how this works, so would like to hear others weigh-in if they understand this better)\n* Really, hitting this price seems like it would create a squeeze of epic proportions\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs of 3\/3 close: (Call Value ITM - Put Value ITM) = **>$226m** | Call Shares ITM - Put Shares ITM = **>11.5m**\n\n---\n\n**Data**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHere's the call-put at various

Overlooked. Unloved. Misunderstood. Sometimes all three. Together, these forces have pushed PBI shares lower for years. Of course, it is not too difficult to understand how this came to be the case. The company\u2019s glory days back when it was lauded in Jim Collins\u2019 Good to Great for leasing mail meters and offering presort mail services have long since passed. Though these businesses continue to generate nice cash flows, mailing revenues have steadily declined for years. Consolidated financials are not pretty, with earnings declining consistently for much of the past decade. All this, for a 100-year-old company that \u2013 not so affectionately these days \u2013 goes by the moniker \u201cthe mail company.\u201d But buried within those consolidated financials that paint the picture of a shrinking company, Pitney Bowes has been building a very promising e-commerce business. It has been a long time coming, but after first getting into the business eight years ago with their acquisition of Newgistics, the shipping business appears poised to thrive. Other factors suggest the company\u2019s fortunes may be turning as well. In recent years, the company has gotten serious about turning things around. Management has refocused the company around mailing, shipping and financing. They have sold off a number of non-core segments. In addition to refocusing the company and simplifying the narrative for prospective shareholders, these moves have also enabled the company to improve its balance sheet, with the majority of debt now supporting the company\u2019s financing business. So now, \u201cthe mail company\u201d is shipping, financing and mailing, with the emphasis on shipping. The Global Ecommerce business is promising. It serves a capacity-constrained segment of the economy that enjoys natural tailwinds from a package delivery market that has been growing steadily at a midteens annual rate for years. Its principal focus is on Domestic Parcel Delivery. Here it focuses on the middle mile, retrieving packages from small and medium size businesses and delivering them to the USPS, who handles final mile delivery. It also offers Cross-Border Solutions and Shipping Solutions, with a primary emphasis on offering transparent and easy to understand pricing models to its growing customer base. Before the pandemic, there were early signs of success. The Global Ecommerce segment had grown to well over $1B in sales, or nearly 40% of the whole company. But like a lot of promising young businesses, it was subscale and unprofitable. In 2019, the segment lost \\~$70M, detracting \\~$.30 from the company\u2019s $.68 of earnings that year. But the pandemic looks to have accelerated this segment\u2019s push to scale. In Q4 2020, domestic parcels shipped grew a promising 76% over last year. And by growing its top 1000 E-  Page 4 Retailer (page 88) client count from 12 to 63 in 2020, Pitney Bowes just passed DHL and their 32 top 1000 E-Retailer count to move to number four on the list. Volumes are now near levels the company had previously suggested operations could become profitable. But due to a deluge of one-time and unabsorbed costs, the segment is still not profitable. Some costs are COVID related. Some come from unabsorbed warehouse facilities. Others reflect lower operational efficiency than one would expect from a scaled operation. But despite the fact profitability has been pushed out a bit, the company has clearly done the right thing for itself, by doing the right thing for its customers. Accordingly, it is likely to keep these customers, and there is little reason to suggest profitability cannot improve over time as previously envisioned.  \n\n\nTLDR: People think it's a mail meter stock but shipping is now more than half of their revenue and and they will soon be valued as a fast growing e-comm play.

Might be rarted, might be genius- I'm doing it either way. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 Like a lot of my fellow smooth-brained \ud83e\udd8d, I view $SKT as not just the next short squeeze, but primed for a gamma squeeze that *will look insane* and just might resuscitate the engulfed bricks-and-mortar retail industry. There are a lot of heavily shorted names out there, and while I expect most of them to reap massive tendies, $SKT is the one that stands out.\n\nLet's start with the elephant in the room: **short-interest** and **% float**. $SKT is currently the most shorted stock out there, with 31.76% of total shares short as of this morning. This beats any of the names we know, GME, AMC, BB, RKT, etc. Interestingly enough, $SKT's \\*% short float is at 47.25%!!\\*Compared to every other \"meme stock,\" (other than GME with 60% +), $SKT is easily one of the most, ***if not THE most*** shorted names in the market right now. ([https:\/\/financhill.com\/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today](https:\/\/financhill.com\/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today)).\n\nNot to mention, *the shares float* provides incredible insights into $SKT's future tendies. Similarly to GME, SKT only has about 90M shares outstanding, while GME has roughly 69M (lol). BBBY has about 121M shares outstanding, which explains why it got somewhat closer to GME than others. But these other names- RKT (1.98B shares), AMC (339M shares), NOK (5.7B shares), BB (563M shares), all have simply *too many shares outstanding*. That's not to say it's impossible to squeeze 'em, but it would require far less capital to squeeze GME, BBBY, or say, **$SKT**.\n\nThe trend in short-interest also seems to be going down, with $SKT and the broader market in general. The WSJ wrote something last week about hedge funds starting to close shorts (or at least being more cautious), and after being the 4th largest put decrease overall in Q4, SKT short interest is off another 19% since February.\n\nOver the past 6 months, we have also seen ever-increasing volume on $SKT. A previous DD mentioned average trading volume on $SKT from the Dec-Feb period was roughly 3M shares, this has increased to roughly $5M shares in the last few months. Today, $SKT appeared to breach the seal with over 17.5M, topping the 10M high we saw in Jan (coincided w\/ GME). *This is incredibly important b\/c heavy volume when a stock moves up puts massive pressure on long shorts*. *Essentially, if I am right, Chapter 1 began today.* (we should keep an eye on the volume this week, more volume is a *great* sign).\n\nAll of the technical trends bode well for $SKT. But what's got me stiffer than a rock are the broader macro forces guiding both the market and the economy. First, $SKT reinstated their dividend for 2021 Q1, indicating they have ample cash not only to weather this storm, but to continue raising payouts to shareholders, which is quite attractive since \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b are getting concerned about rising rates. No problem- SKT has stable, fixed payments, and will award investors for holding- *these will also increase as the economy improves, attracting more investors*. **\u2705**\n\nNext, we heard from Biden earlier in the week that they expect vaccine distribution to be ramped up by May, not July. This is a *huge WIN* for battered-down bricks-and-mortar retailers who have caved b\/c of public health restrictions. As investors race to pick up these forgotten family spots, the \"value\" or really just oversold names will start to fly. **\u2705**\n\nNot to mention, Tanger Mall Outlets' whole premise is their malls are ***OUTDOORS***, perfect for a post-Covid world that is more mindful of social distancing\/sanitation. **\u2705**\n\nWhere do I think this could go? This is where market cap\/valuation comes into play. For all you dipshits who look at the share price and ask \"wHy It DoNt Go Up,\" *market cap is the true determinant*. $SKT currently has a $1.7B market cap, far less than competitors MAC ($2.1B), SPG ($40B) or other highly shorted names like RKT ($56B) or AMC ($2.9B).\n\nSo is a $200 price target a little fluffy and optimistic? Sure. But tldr, when you factor in **how shorted $SKT has been** (heavily shorted by Melvin Capital among others; most shorted stock right now- overall\/float), the **attractive fundamentals** (outdoors\/social distancing friendly), the **improving economic landscape** (vaccine ramp-up by May\/$2T stimulus that will really help small companies), **rising rates** (the shift towards value\/dividend-paying stocks)- I have to say, I like the stock, quite a lot.\n\nSo help me God, $SKT is going to fucking *skrt-skrt* to the moon!\n\n\\*UPDATE: A lot of people have been saying Melvin Capital owns SKT. This is **FALSE**. Melvin owns SKT convertible debt- likely b\/c they are grubbing for yield (who can blame them on something as fruitful as SKT)? This actually is a good sign to me, as boomers who find SKT dividends attractive will push up the stock- another catalyst for a gamma squeeze. *Never ever fall victim to false information, please do your own homework*.\n\n**Link to Melvin puts on SKT**: [https:\/\/fintel.io\/i\/melvin-capital-management-lp](https:\/\/fintel.io\/i\/melvin-capital-management-lp)\n\n\\*\\*This is not financial advice. Please do your own research and evaluate your portfolio from there.\n\nCurrently own 4\/16 $25C; 6\/18 $30C; 9\/17 $30C","334":"Tell me again how this is FUD ? FIRST AND FOREMOST THIS IS NOT MEANT TO GET ANYONE TO SELL GME FOR RKT!\n\nHODL GME FOR THE MOON!!!\n\nOk, now with that out of the way....\n\nThe DD seems solid on RKT and seems to mirror GME right before the first big run. Congrats to u\/SIR_JACK_A_LOT on his huge YOLO. However, all I hear is that it's a distraction or Shitadel P&D. Don't get me wrong, I'm still HODLing 15k GME for the moon but how isn't this getting more support? Out of 1.98 billion shares, there are only 200k shares available per IBorrowDesk and a reported short float of 37.47% by FINRA.\n\nThis tweet from Ihor @ S3 went out earlier today claiming that the short float has now increased to 45.15% and is his top candidate for a squeeze.\n\n[https:\/\/twitter.com\/ihors3\/status\/1367164152041644034?s=20](https:\/\/twitter.com\/ihors3\/status\/1367164152041644034?s=20)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*Not financial advice...

The following is ASO DD and why it could take GME to the next level based on reinvesting gains. Academy Sports & Outdoors (ASO) beat last quarters earnings by 2.X times predictions. My thesis involves a run up to the Q4 earnings report March 31. Besides the company consistently outperforming market expectations it currently sits as the third most shorted stock (under GME and Tanger).\n\nSince the pandemic began gun and ammo sales have been going through the roof. You may think this would be a negative factor going forward as things calm down but January 2021 had the 3rd highest gun sales record in history. Ammo stocks have seen a boost but then a drop as they report they cannot keep up with supply.\n\nHunting, fishing, camping, kayaking and other outdoor hobbies have seen a huge increase since the pandemic began, this shit ain't over fokes and we know how much autists spend on new hobbies.\n\nTexas is \"opening back up\" and eliminating the mask mandate. Texas has almost 10% of the US population and they love guns, ammo and the outdoors. ASO is going to be absolutely packed. On top of that, they're all about to receive that sweet stimey money and it sure isn't going into investments. This will undoubtably create positive sentiment articles. \n\nSo this all sounds like a long term bull case right? Wrong. ASO has seen huge spikes in 2021, as have most of the most heavily shorted stocks. This one has the financials and positive momentum to keep it going. If it garners enough interest, as RKT did, a pop is bound to happen as people see the value.\n\nHow does this affect GME? Have you seen the posts of people reinvesting gains from RKT and weed stocks? This is the next stop on the road to the moon. P.S. I'm drunk on tendies so excuse misspellings, grammar and lack of charts.","336":"The revival of ROCK HANDS Lurker just wanting to add a little to the discussion  (excuse not adopting the lingo, I don't post often).\n\n I'm no financial advisor so don't take my word and such, but I do remember before the GME craze there was a term called rock hands for the people who could stand a beating but still come out on top because their DD was sound. An example I can give to everyone now to understand, is say you bought into GME at 200, averaged down to 90 (when it hovered in the 40s for a week), then sold at 180 when it bounced back. I'd say that was a rock hand play. You came in high, averaged down, then still 2X your money, brovo. (I guess disclaimer, I hold GME and got in way before you). \n\nI know it's cool now to say paper hand this and paper hand that, but if you ain't making no money or losing a lot of money I'm not sure why you on a betting subreddit. Make big moves but not dumb moves. Not every hand is a diamond hand play, infact a diamond hand play is ultra rare. You gonna find a lot of 2x, 3x, 4x, 5x plays rather than the say 10X or more.....Or you might lose it all, who knows. But without a DD you really are a retard and more than likely bout to get your pockets ran. \n\nBut as I said im just a lurker, i'm not trying to sway anyone to buy or sell anything. I'm just reminiscing about the other forgotten hand. Make some money fellas, it's a lot of rock handed plays out there. But keep digging deep until you find that diamond hand play for sure. I'm out.","337":"TURN OFF INSTANT SETTLEMENTS and LEAVE ROBINHOOD! Robinhood is lending your shares to shorters. Don't believe me? \n\nHow's about this, from Reuters, yesterday: https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-retail-trading-robinhood-securitiesle-idUSKCN2AU2EP\n\nBut you have margin turned off! But you have a sell limit set for $69,420.69! IT DOESN'T MATTER. \n\nINSTANT SETTLEMENTS is what needs to be TURNED OFF. They even hide it away, under profile>menu>investing>DAY TRADE SETTINGS. \n\nOn top of that, THEY DO NOT LET YOU TURN IT OFF IF YOU HAVE ANY PENDING DEPOSITS OR HAVE TRADED IN THE LAST 3 DAYS. \n\nThat's the cost of instant settlements. Sure, you get to trade quicker, but you also allow them to trade AGAINST you, and WITH YOUR OWN SHARES.\n\nCan't turn off instant settlements, don't want to be stuck in limbo for a full brokerage transfer, and determined to escape? What can be done?\n\nWell, my fellow smooth-brained ape, I'll tell you what I'm doing:\n\nThe following steps assume you are invested primarily in shares of a company, not options. EACH OF THESE STEPS WILL TAKE TIME TO PROCESS, SO PLAN ACCORDINGLY.\n\nFirst, open an account at a different brokerage. Make sure it's a cash-account (for some brokerages, like WeBull, etc., YOU MUST OPT-OUT OF SHARE LENDING). With a cash-account, you'll have to sit patiently for settlement of funds from selling shares before you can withdraw those funds or reinvest (but, let's be honest, you wouldn't be reading this if you weren't already patient). I use Fidelity, which is a cash-account by default with several opt-in programs to take advantage of down the line. \n\nSecond, IF YOU CAN AFFORD IT, transfer\/deposit money into your new brokerage from your bank (or wherever else you usually get your money to trade with). If GME is your sole play, and you can afford it, try to deposit around the same amount your GME shares in Robinhood are currently worth. \n\nOnce your deposit is completed (no longer \"pending\"), wait for a small dip in the price and buy in with your new broker. \n\nWhen the purchase is complete, you can go into Robinhood and sell your shares (ideally, at the same or slightly higher price than you just bought them for at your new brokerage).\n\nWait out the next few trading days of your Robinhood account and DO NOT TRADE VIA ROBINHOOD. If you trade, you risk resetting the clock on your Withdrawable Cash. You do your trading with your new brokerage from now on. Withdraw your cash from Robinhood ASAP and put it back in your bank account, pay back your wife's boyfriend, or whatever.\n\nNow, if Robinhood wants to keep any short deals they had on your shares, THEY have to hold onto the shares, themselves. Every 1 share you were holding away from shorters (ineffectively), has now become 2 shares (1 effectively, 1 ineffectively). That, or Robinhood actually does sell the shares, which increases the length of the short chain and the costs associated with holding that position.. Thus, shorting attempts are made more expensive and less sustainable. \n\nMeanwhile, you'll be back to holding your shares without your broker selling them behind your back. \n\nTLDR: Don't let your diamond hands be sold by the pawn shop that's storing them. Getting out of Robinhood not only helps you, but also hinders the shorts. Two birds with one stone. Power to the players.\n\nObligatory, not financial advice, not an adviser or professional, do your own research, yadayada. \n\nIf I'm wrong about anything in the above, do not be surprised, but please let me know what it might be. If my foundation is rotted, please kick my case over before anyone even considers moving in. Thanks.","338":"How I use WSB (A NOOB's take on r\/WSB) I've been trading stocks very passively since Robinhood became available. I would watch a little CNBC, try to identify bargains, then purchase some stock and try to ignore it. Now, I am trading actively every day. I'm a full-time undergraduate math student, and I just got accepted into a graduate program, so it's pretty likely that I will be back to doing passive investing by Fall 2021. FYI I might be studying math finance.\n\nI first heard about WSB through my buddy who started getting into options when we got our stimulus last June. His take was that he was too poor for $1200 to matter very much and that if the economy tanked that wouldn't do him very much good. I think he was pretty actively engaged, made about $5000. I know he's still around here, but he has a regular job so I doubt he's as active as he was back then.\n\nTrading is work. It's kind of like being in business for yourself, a bit like being a professional gambler, and I don't think any of these things means it deserves any stigma. There are psychological labor and decision fatigue and it stays with you after the markets close and on the weekends. I started drinking more and started using a little more THC. None of these things are of major concern: I don't consider my day trading or substance use any kind of addiction.\n\nI joined WSB when GME was popping off. I had been paying attention to the news but didn't buy in till it was about $350 on that Wednesday. Yes WSB influenced my decision, so did the YouTuber In The Money, but I don't think anybody could have predicted the way in which the squeeze was going to be kneecapped that next morning.\n\nI stayed on WSB, trying to figure out the good info from the bad info. I posted to another website about GME. When GME stabilized around $50 I was down $6k, not to mention the fact I had sold my MJ stocks to buy GME (I really should've used cash which I could've deposited).\n\nI didn't really let any of this get to me. We all have our reasons for wanting to make money. IMO it was worth the risk, which is why I'm still here. However, if I want to keep trading, I can't YOLO my money into a meme stock - I'm a student with no income.\n\nSo I started getting more serious about options trading. I don't do high probability trading, I just look at charts and buy options based on which direction the price is moving. I've seen videos about the Greeks, but I really don't pay that close attention to things other than the bid-ask spread and IV. I like options because they're leveraged and I can make money on bearish positions.\n\nHow does WSB fit into my trading strategy? I look for meme stocks, read the DD, and then look at the chart. If I like the chart I might try a trade, if I don't like it I might ignore it or add it to a watchlist. It's pretty simple and it's helped me identify many profitable trades.\n\nI comment on stuff in the daily thread, sometimes I answer a question. I shit post a little. I call out BS but I don't push my gay af communism on y'all. This is the only Reddit I am on and the only social media I'm on is Mastadon and a few discord channels.\n\nIf you've read this, you probably aren't someone constantly screaming in the Daily. If you're new here like me please don't fuck it up. Stop screaming in the daily thread about every little movement of your meme stock. The risk is that we eventually need stricter gatekeeping and that's very intensive and difficult. We might even be targeted by regulators which would make Wall Street very happy.\n\nOne final mention is about information security. Infosec is about keeping private info private and public info accurate. I can guarantee you that we have the attention of every major intelligence apparatus (private, public, government, etc) watching what we're doing. There are shills, influencers, bots and bad-actors. This is just a part of any public movement. If you want to read about the way state's organize their counter-intelligence efforts, here's a link to a Wikipedia page: [https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Counterintelligence#Counterintelligence\\_missions](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Counterintelligence#Counterintelligence_missions)\n\nThanks for taking the time to read, I hope that this has been a helpful perspective on WSB from a noob. Go bers!","339":"\"RKT is being pushed as a distraction from GME\": a quantitative analysis EDIT: Based on the fact that a number of comments seem to have been made without reading beyond the first 9 words of the title, and the fact that this is sitting at 60% upvoted, I'd encourage you to at least read to the TLDR.\n\nI usually stick to providing raw data, but this post has a little bit of added analysis. I don\u2019t own $GME or $RKT (I don't actively invest to avoid accusations of bias in my data) and don\u2019t like either stock over the other. I do like WSB though and don\u2019t like baseless conspiracy theories, and I have seen a lot of conspiracy theories flying around WSB recently without much evidence to accompany them. Most recently, I got flooded by comments like this on my data post yesterday.\n\n[Comments](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/baa7ritypuk61.png?width=1432&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6b8eab6ff5519aac82a87a06e742d52aa74440e)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe goal of this post was to look at one of those theories and see if I can provide a base for it. The theory in question is \u201c$RKT discussion is being artificially pushed to distract from $GME\u201d. A TLDR of my analysis is:\n\n**A) Both $RKT and $GME are being discussed by a lot of accounts that are new to posting on WSB.**\n\n**B) Accounts discussing $GME are actually newer to WSB on average than accounts discussing $RKT**\n\n**C) There are a small, but non-zero, number of people trying to artificially manipulate discussion to get others to sell $GME. However, this is done with no relation to $RKT.**\n\n**D) Accounts mentioning $GME and $RKT behave similarly in promoting the respective stocks.**\n\nThrough my analysis I wasn\u2019t able to find any solid evidence of $RKT being artificially pushed as a distraction from $GME. While it\u2019s easy to complain about u\/zjz's iron-fisted bot army, I think it deserves a lot of credit for curbing attempts at manipulation.\n\nNow I will provide the data backing up these conclusions, and call out one account I did find attempting to artificially manipulate discussion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Both $RKT and $GME are being discussed by a lot of accounts that are new to posting on WSB. Accounts discussing $GME are actually newer to WSB on average than accounts discussing $RKT.**\n\nI don\u2019t think I need to patronize you with a bunch of facts and figures showing how much attention has been drawn to wsb recently. Obviously this attention came with a lot of new posters, and that\u2019s fully on display when we look at when accounts talking about $GME and $RKT first joined the wsb community. The motive behind looking at these numbers was to determine whether there were a bunch of new accounts who joined the community with the sole purpose of distracting from $GME.\n\nThe average $RKT poster first posted on wsb on December 10th, 2020. This is pretty shockingly young, but the average $GME poster is even newer to the community with an average date of December 22nd, 2020.\n\nHere are histograms showing when the accounts mentioning both stocks first joined the community, by year:\n\n[RKT Histogram](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/qp652yp7quk61.png?width=1726&format=png&auto=webp&s=2cc3b954aea59a00e2a3f0e570b825e614c0cec0)\n\n[GME Histogram](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/d79kdzu8quk61.png?width=1726&format=png&auto=webp&s=95408f675b12f97cbd9231e71fa96aac0c43b1d8)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**There is a non-zero number of people trying to manipulate discussion to get others to sell $GME, but not enough to have a significant effect.**\n\nOne other thing I examined was how much different accounts were shilling $GME and $RKT. For the most part, there wasn\u2019t too much spam of either ticker by individual accounts with a few notable exceptions. Below are scatter plots showing accounts with the date they joined WSB on the x-axis and the number of times they have mentioned $GME\/$RKT in the last 5 days on the y-axis.\n\n[$GME date joined vs. mentions](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/g9vgmq6gquk61.png?width=1852&format=png&auto=webp&s=73571b1836771fc0c8fa3c80eebd738d13bd5d9b)\n\n[$RKT date joined vs. mentions](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/0a8xwqlkquk61.png?width=1752&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7e79bb797abbdf49eb43b4c7fd94c4541c6d58b)\n\nThere are 3 prominent outliers that I will examine, one of which I think probably deserves some sort of moderator action. On the $GME graph we have \/u\/char1101g way out in the upper right. He just started posting on here yesterday, and has been just absolutely spamming anti-GME shit since. Although posts like \"SELL YOU GME STOCK\" seem to match the grammar and speech patterns expected of a short-only investor, I don't really see this single example as solid evidence of a larger artificial anti-GME push.\n\nOn the $RKT side of things we have two accounts that are pretty clearly tied to real people, so I don\u2019t want to call them out by username. While I\u2019d say they\u2019re pretty clearly innocent of being hedge fund accounts (old accounts, lots of personal info, lots of non-wsb posts), they\u2019re absolutely guilty of living in the discussion threads, with dozens of comments already today. You could probably make an argument that someone commenting about $RKT all day long is having some impact on the overall discussion, but given that it\u2019s just two random dudes I kind of doubt it has much of an effect in the grand scheme of things.\n\n**Accounts mentioning $GME and $RKT behave similarly in promoting the respective stocks.**\n\nThe last thing I wanted to look at was how accounts behaved in promoting $GME and $RKT. In particular, I wanted to see if accounts mentioning either stock were more likely to mention it repeatedly. I ended up not finding much of a significant difference. Below is a table where $GME\/$RKT accounts are defined as accounts mentioning each respective stock.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Mentions of $RKT\/$GME over last 5 days|$RKT accounts|$GME accounts|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|\\>1|.806|.801|\n|\\>2|.653|.657|\n|\\>5|.454|.433|\n|\\>10|.331|.310|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere's a pretty small overlap (34%) between people talking about $GME and people talking about $RKT, likely leading to some of the conflict that we have seen, but from my research I wasn't able to find any solid evidence of $RKT being artificially pushed as a distraction from $GME.  That being said, I'm happy to hear criticisms on my work, let me know below if you have any thoughts.","340":"GME AMC Due Dili Wed 3\/3 12PM EST short borrow rates and availability GME AMC Due Dili Wed 3\/3 12PM EST short borrow rates and availability\n\nAt 12:00PM EST The borrowing cost rate on GME slightly dropped and AMC has moved UP  vs. my last report (Monday 3\/1).\n\nGAMESTOP CORP. -2.914%\/APR\n\nAMC ENTERTAINMENT -4.661%\/APR\n\nWhile these rates are slightly different than my prior reported rates and much lower than >20% APR rates a few weeks ago, any marked-up rates from  'general collateral' imply the securities remain hard to borrow - to some extent.

Catalyst? Tanger (SKT) is presenting at the Citi conference on March 11, not just yo mama\u2019s mall.\n\nIT\u2019S THE MOST SHORTED STOCK RIGHT NOW\n\nhttps:\/\/financhill.com\/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today\n\nTo the moon we go \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nPREVIOUS DD:\n\n$SKT DD (Tanger Outlet Malls) *VALUE PLAY* please read \ud83d\ude0c\n\n9th most shorted stock right now, great re-opening play to cope with new Covid environments. Tanger literally has open air malls that make it really unique in this new era of bricks and mortar retail.\n\nNow, let\u2019s look at the technicals. It currently has a 52% short float, which lags large squeezes like GME (121%) and SPCE (72%), but exceeds that of other performing names like AMC and BB.\n\nI think $SKT is so compelling at a roughly $1.2B market cap. For comparison, its primary competitor $MAC has double the valuation, but does not have the same flexible retail space as Tanger.\n\nIf you look at GME\u2019s short squeeze, they shot up right around $20 or ($1.2B market cap)!! \ud83d\udc40 Furthermore, Melvin and other big hedge funds are long on their $SKT shorts, and any surprise to the upside will send the stock absolutely flying.\n\nTanger has also reinstated their dividend. In a time where many bricks and mortar retail shops are desparate for cash, $SKT is out here with $700M of liquidity.\n\nCompanies with this much cash relative to their market cap are INTRINSICALLY UNDERVALUED. Even if this thing were to just double in market cap to just under $3B, that would leave a share price of roughly $32. The intrinsic value of the mall network is worth AT LEAST (in my mind) 5-7X where we are now at roughly $13 ($1.2B). \n\nThese other names that I mentioned above have taken off given their market cap of $3-5B, and I FULLY EXPECT THAT RALLY TO CONTINUE. The short interest here is just too overwhelming for it to not push the stock flying at the slightest uptick.\n\nBut for the best value play, FACTORED WITH THE HEAVY SHORT FLOAT, I gotta go with $SKT. Holding 3200 shares at $17 and adding more as we go down. 18.7 days left for shorters to cover, so I think the squeeze is coming soon.\n\n** Check out Tanger\u2019s new CEO, Steven Yalof, if you are interested. He was a prominent leader at Simon Property Group, with the intent on expanding consumer base beyond retail stores.

May get a lil cheaper first , so watch it a little b4 you buy. Ceo projected 20 billion dollars revenue 2022. Market cap is under 15. You do the math\n\n\nIm here to tell you all what play im currently holding 30 shares in and plan to double down on in the morming because the price is insanely good, and tbh may even get better in coming days from a buyers perspective. It is currently down 43% from its ath, only reached due tl INTERIM p3 results. \nLets start with the bad. \n\nIn 33 years theyve never reached full fda approval for anything. Close but no cigar every time. \n\nIt has held a steady slightly pessimist short interest of 10% for the entire time ive been invested, but in that time institutional ownership has climbed from 49% to about 88% now. I have strong reason to believe this short interest is now much larger. Please read on. \nWhen the nasdaq is down and theres no good news for the stock, it sinks. When theres mildly good news, the stock sinks. Shorts? Maybe.\n\nMany big money vaccines already approved. US market share likely holding mass inventory of big pharma and baby oil vaccines by the time FDA approves. This doesnt matter too much, the united states has a contract with nvax for 100 million doses at 16 a pop that they buy on fda approval, period.  The big pharma vaccines efficacys vs variants and transmission are laughable. The world is a  breeding ground for variants right now. A problem novavaxs platform will easily develop quadralent boosters for. \n\nHonestly, theres not a whole lot of bad imo. These bad things seems good to me. \nThe good.\nIts absurdly cheap right now, almost as cheap as before p3 interim data. This is because the ceo sucks at talking and people dont like the 1 to 2 month timeline he mentiomed on nbc yesterday for approvals. That same morning he told new york times \"he loves burning shorts\".\nLast week, boris johnson said novavax approval was coming soon. \nThe market price never reacted to the covax deal of 1.1 billion doses because we dont know the price yet, and shorts are trying to say the 3 dollars poor countries will pay is what nvax will get per dose. Thats not how donation and subsidization works. Nvax is getting way more than 3. At least 10. \nIts efficacy is first class, please look it up, the scientists online have already explained it better than i can. \nToday the price tanked , due to his interview yesterday RIGHT AFTER SAYING HE LOVES BURNING SHORTS. Yes he said fda is 2-3 months out.\nThey have rolling approvals in dozens of places happening! And their final phase 3 data can drop anytime!. The short interest has been 10% for a while and i just KNOW its higher now.\nInstitutional holdings hasnt dropped. The name novavax is appearing in the news more and more. Its happening this month. Idk how long shares will be near 200, i wouldnt be surprised if you can pick some up for 180 tomorrow. But theres a squeeze coming. Not like gme was, this isnt hundreds of percent short. Its in the teens. That will still be a nice spike to an already large biotech spike.\n\nB.riley eoy price target : 398. \nI think we see more than that. Weve already seen 330.\nThe news that propels us could happen any day. But dont leave gme. Im in there too.

It's awesome that we have people YOLOing their money into GME but the few quality posts on this sub have been swamped by GME content.\n\n**INFO**\n\nThere has been hysteria about bots that have been on the sub creating fake content.

If a price movement fails to be validated by adequate volume , then there is going to be an equal an opposite reaction. There exists a variable that satisfies both quantitative and fundamental analysts. That is the Volume Weighted Average Price ( VWAP ) and it is complemented by the Volume Weighted Moving Average ( VWMA ). When you do not consider the weight of volume in price movements, you are at the mercy of manipulative, high volume whales that seek to sink Simple Moving Averages ( SMAs ) during times of low volume in the interest of accumulation of the asset.\n\nVWAPs can be treated as the \"true\" price of an asset on any given resolution, but become less sensitive to change as you zoom out. These ever-shifting values can be treated as floors, in bullish times, and ceilings, during a bear market. You can always expect a \"bounce\" off of the VWAP in the opposite direction at least once as price attempts to cross over it. These resistance lines are useful to every audience, the soon-to-be long holders who would like to plan a decent entry, the short sellers trying to make a quick buck, and the swing traders who like to make money regardless of who controls the market. One should always keep in mind that price never strays too far from the VWAP before attempting to violently correct itself in the other direction.\n\nThere is a measure of movement around the VWAP , which we'll call volatility , and it masks the true price of the asset and its direction. By following the VWAP , you can see accurately whether the asset is going high or low. I'm using these customized bands to look for long entries (in the green or below) and short entries (in the red or above) to make short term profits to be accumulated in my spot balances. Ultimately, by building your position you can ensure a long-term profit but it doesn't mean too much if one simply never takes profit.\n\nLongs can be slept on. Shorts must be monitored. Set a budget, craft a plan, and stick to it. Remember to remove your principal investment at some point to reduce your risk.\n\nIn a bull market, buy at the monthly VWAP (Purple Line) and in a bear market, sell there.\n\nHappy Hunting!- Patch Hemlock\n\n[https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/chart\/GME\/ApPTU3cw-Keep-Your-Eyes-on-the-Volume-Behind-the-Movement\/](https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/chart\/GME\/ApPTU3cw-Keep-Your-Eyes-on-the-Volume-Behind-the-Movement\/)\n\nProof of Institutional Use of VWAP: WATCH LIVE: GameStop hearing: Robinhood, Citadel and Reddit CEOs testify \u2014 2\/18\/21 by CNBC Television on YouTube (Timestamp 4:55:34)\n\nEDIT: For any would-be quants out there, I've developed an open-source pine script to act as a springboard for you\n\n[https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/script\/kJqBZ6s8-Realtime-All-Time-High-and-All-Time-Low-Tracker-WIP\/](https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/script\/kJqBZ6s8-Realtime-All-Time-High-and-All-Time-Low-Tracker-WIP\/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReposted due to automoderation of youtube links\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDECLARATION OF BIAS:\n\npurchased GME at $13 and AMC at $4\n\ndoubled down after the crash at $50 and $6 respectively\n\nnever sold","352":"Do I read this right?

This restriction was fully removed on 2\/5 (**Friday**). 7 trading days but 9 days include weekend. In between there were partial restriction that is almost the same as full restriction.\n* During that time period, GME closed down on 1\/28, but higher on 1\/29 (Friday). Big drops for the next 4 days (Mon - Thur) from \\~350 to \\~53. The next day they fully removed the buy restriction, and the price went up to \\~63. That's **Friday**.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/llgbvn5cd4k61.png?width=360&format=png&auto=webp&s=1825434b6e2855764a7776708dd5998437860f53\n\nI was puzzled by the timing.\n\n* The **up trend** is still intact up to 1\/29, the second day into restriction even though there was big drop the day before, when the buy restriction was implemented. If the restriction was removed then the up trend would most likely still in place, even enhanced.\n\n1. Several other platform had restriction on 1\/28 but no more the next day (Please help to verify this). Why R still has the restriction?\n2. News reported that R **raised 1B on 1\/29, and another 2.4B on 2\/1 (Monday when another big drop happened). If there restriction was based on the capital requirement by DTCC, would this 3.4B more than enough to fulfill that requirement(<1B as we now know)?** Why did they still keep that restriction? Earlier that week citadel provided 2B bailout to short seller Melvin.\n\n* The **down trend** starting from 2\/1 lasted 4 days until 2\/4 Thursday. The big drop on 2\/4 knocked GME from 91 to 53. At this point if it went down even more( 35 level on the left side plateau) it would likely bounce back hard from there. **The more the compress, the more the explosion power.** The restriction was **fully removed on 2\/5 the next day Friday**. It was perceived as a good news but people tend to be cautious during Friday because of uncertainty of weekend. This seems to be calculated, well timed action to reduce big swing. The price had relatively small bounce back, which slowed the downward pressure but at the same time released the explosive power from the compression.","356":"Using Covered Calls to Buy Volatile Stocks like GEE EM EE at a Steep Discount # Typically, covered calls provide a laughable premium while capping your potential gains.\n\nLet\u2019s use AMD as an example as it looked Friday at close.

AMD closed at $84.51 when the mid price for this option was $3.07. Purchasing 100 shares of AMD for $8451 and selling this option for $307 costs us $8144 and caps our max gains at $606 or 7.4%.

Have fun with all the text:\n\nSo. The VW short squeeze spent a lot of time pretending to be a model for GME, with many trying to compare two very different graphs to predict future performance. There seemed to be a very common response to these VW shills, which was often along the lines of: \u201cwell, yeah there are more GME shares shorted than there were VW shares, but since the effective GME float is (whether made of original or duplicate counterfeit shares [again, reference the wonderful document which was shared around our community some weeks ago]) significantly larger than the 1% or so of VW shares there was, in effect the 13% short interest on VW led to a 13:1 short:float ratio meanwhile GME would, by nature of its much larger float, have a smaller ratio despite the fact it has far, far greater short interest (math 101).\nI accepted this for the last few weeks, but recently after trying to explain this to my mother through an actual example I came up with a very interesting differentiating factor which no one has really mentioned:\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR:\nYou can cover INFINITE short positions with ONE real share, as long as you make an infinite number of transactions, but you can only cover ONE naked short position with the ONE created counterfeit share.\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s explain that for those that don\u2019t immediately get the logic.\nImagine you are a hedge fund who shorted VW. Presumably, the vast majority if not ALL of the shorts executed went the following way:\n\nyou start with ~0~ shares\nyou borrow one from a broker\nyou now have ~1~ shares\nyou sell that share, completing your short\nyou now have ~0~ shares\n\nNow imagine the short squeeze happens.\nAnd let\u2019s say there are 100 people like you who all shorted one real share each. The thing is, you can buy a share off the market, returning your total to ~1~ shares, before you return it to ~0~ shares by giving it to your broker. Your broker can now sell that share to other shorts, and they to other shorts, etc.\nThe point being, when working with real shares, an infinite number of transactions can theoretically clear an infinite number of shorts (while still driving the price up).\n\nNow here\u2019s the kicker, which has been tormenting me over the last few days as I try not to get my hopes too high:\nImagine you are an immensely idiotic hedge fund, named Delvin Capital. \nYou go ahead and do some sexy naked shorting.\n\nyou start with ~0~ shares\nyou DO NOT BORROW ONE from your broker!\nyou sell a \u201cshare\u201d, promising to fulfill the step you just skipped \u201csometime soonish maybe\u201d\nyou now have ~ -1 ~ shares!!\n\nNow the squeeze happens, as above. But this time, the 100 other friends of yours are similarly positioned, and also made naked short positions. Notice the problem when you try to cover using the above strategy: you buy that one share off the market to cover your short. Notice: your total is not positive, but only ~0~, since you were actually negative to begin with! \nThus, you can\u2019t give these shares to your broker, or another fund, since doing so would only return you to a negative value: \n\nTHE POINT BEING, naked shorts, unlike normal PG-13 shorts, have what is effectively a 1:1 COVER RATIO\nThe whole idea of hedgies rapidly trading shares back and forth with each other to cover is, as far as I can reason, IMPOSSIBLE. Maybe that\u2019s why they haven\u2019t squeezed yet?\n\nHere\u2019s where VW vs. GME comes back in, though. GME\u2019s nominal institutional ownership is over 100%. Furthermore, with all the recently unearthed ETF shorts added in, GME shorts are pretty obviously over 100%. When you consider that, with retail NOT EVEN FACTORED INTO THE EQUATION, this 1:1 cover ratio is completely in feasible for shorts, their desperation seems to have been, if anything, undervalued this whole time. The ONLY WAY THEY CAN COVER NAKED SHORTS is buy repurchasing an almost IDENTICAL NUMBER OF SHARES, and it is THIS FACT that they are not just able to purchase a few shares and move them around like they might otherwise have been able to but would literally have to buy more shares than exist *WITHOUT TRADING THE SAME ONES BACK AND FORTH* which makes this fucking crazy.\nAssuming retail and bullish institutions hold, it is not just exceedingly costly, but impossible for them to cover.\n\n\nIf you\u2019ve gotten this far, congratulations.\nNow think about that again.\n\n\nEffective TL;DR 2.0:\n\nPeople asked what the price would be like if demand is infinite and supply minuscule?\nProbably pretty fucking high. VW may be a good example.\n\nBut here\u2019s MY question:\nWhat will the price be like if demand is infinite and it is literally impossible for supply to ever meet it? \nVW is definitely not a good example. If anything, it\u2019s an understatement. I think THIS is what actually makes GME something we\u2019ve never, ever seen before in all of financial history.\n\n\nPlease reflect on this and correct me if I\u2019m wrong. I hope I\u2019m not.\nJoy to all,\n~Unimportant\n\n\n(this is not financial advise, and I am not a financial advisor)","359":"Dear Apes, why was Rocket\u2019s dividend strategy genius? I\u2019ll try to dumb it down for you fuck tards. Happy Saturday Tards. Oh and a heart-felt go fuck yourself to the WSB mods! Ban me again you cunts, I don\u2019t care \ud83e\udd70\n\nApes, lmk if I am missing anything with this thesis:\n\nWhen I first heard RKT was doing a dividend I was pissed - no true growth companies pay out dividends. It\u2019s for boomer companies like XOM or CVX. But this one-time special dividend  is VASTLY different. Why? Well strap on your helmet and kneebow pads and I\u2019ll tell you fece-tossing apes.\n\nRKT insiders own 95% of $RKT shares. So 95% of the dividend payout is going to Rocket insiders (75% of which is owned by Dan Gilbert, the reincarnation of King Haramabe himself). \n\n$RKT insiders are literally paying themselves; they can use the cash they pay themselves to buy-back stock while forcing shorts to pay a dividend and enticing investors to buy in simultaneously. If you tree-swinging Orangutans didn\u2019t already know, Rocket attempted to deter shorts during November\u2019s earnings call by adding a $1 billion dollar buy back. \n\nIt didn\u2019t work. Shorts only continued to pile in, but here\u2019s the thing. Rocket hasn\u2019t used a PENNY of that buyback. They are still fully loaded with ammunition to fuck over the shorts with a billion dollars to buy back shares.  $1B buyback is OVER HALF OF THEIR PUBLIC FLOAT. \n\n**Shorts have to pay the dividend?**\n\nYes. If a stock in which you currently have a short position pays a dividend, you are responsible for the dividend on the shares you have borrowed. When the dividend is due, your broker will withdraw cash from your brokerage account equal to the amount of the dividend paid on the shorted shares.\n\n\n**BuT iF RkT Is So UnDeRvALuEd, WhY HaVeN\u2019T tHeY BoUgHt BaCk AnY ShArEs ?**\n\nGREAT QUESTION my jello-brained friend, now wipe the drool off the side of your mouth and I\u2019ll tell you. \n\nThe reason Rocket hasn\u2019t bought back any shares is because, companies are unable to exercise a buy back if they are holding non-public, material information(their new partnership with Etrade and Morgan Stanley AND the special dividend announcement). I assumed before the ER that they hadn\u2019t bought back any shares for this reason and still believe it to be true. Now that the partner and dividend announcement is behind them, the $RKT can fire at will and is clear for take off \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nRocket insiders will receive $2B from the special dividend which is more than enough to cover the buy back plan they announced back in November. \n\nInitially, I wanted an increase in the amount of buy back but then I realized that the special dividend may be one of the smartest moves they could make. This move is very calculated - it may complement their buy back strategy tremendously, force shorts to pay more money on top of the 80% interest they are paying to borrow shares, and also motivate retards like you to ditch GME and buy a real winner. Not to mention Rocket was already a popular stock among option traders but its share volume was low. This FAT dividend will motivate more investors to choose shares rather than options, which will help increase our chances of a breakout on volume. \n\n**BuT YoU CaNt SqUeEzE a 40 BiLlIoN DoLlAR CoMpAnY:**\n\nDon\u2019t focus on the size of the company. Focus on the size of their public float. Which makes them a FUBO sized company in a sense, and they are a company that is actually sustainable and will continue growing. We all know how GameStop\u2019s ending will be written. Patient GME shorts will end up making money because GME will eventually fall back to its worth\/value. But Rocket is different. When Rocket hits the $30s, it will never see the $20s again. There is nothing for shorts to \u201cwait out\u201d on this play.

[News flair section also have posts about it](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/ltduq8\/only_time_we_can_support\/). \n\nWas trying to game out what to do should Robinhood goes IPO and reasons for actions.\n\na. Short: talk about poetic justice. Robinhood screwed retail investors in the GME squeeze and it is time to squeeze back. Besides, there are ample footings for shorting Robinhood. The GME squeeze has exposed Robinhood's shady practices and it is under a lot of watchful eyes. To file such a hasty IPO when it has not cleared its name yet may be a sign that early investors are already nervous about its prospects and they are trying to capitalize and exit early. \n\nb. Long: regardless of all the shortfalls, Robinhood has broadened stock trading to an unprecedented level in this market. It still has a strong, loyal and ever expanding user base, including many in this subreddit. Revenue shot up more than 500% in 2020; even after the pandemic ebbs the habit of trading with Robinhood won't die out. \n\nc. Just a normal stock.

I did some research & analysis. Before I start, I just want to say I am writing this because last time I put up speculative DD, and people were tearing it apart because it was very generalized. Being that I have a scientific background I decided to put the time in to gather all the information and analyze it with statistics before posting this one. I hope some of you find it meaningful and I would appreciate any genuine feedback or constructive criticism!\n\n**Hypothesis:** GME is responsible for the previous two market dips and has the ability to significantly move the direction of the entire market.\n\nNew York Stock Exchange (NYA), Market Cap ($22.9 trillion), 2400 stock listings\n\nNasdaq (IXIC), Market Cap (??), 3300+ listings + S&P 500(MC: $31.61 trillion).\n\nDow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), Market Cap ($8.33 trillion), 30 largest of (NYA and Nasdaq)\n\n**TLDR;\/Abstract:** I compare the relationship between GME, and the world's largest market indices mentioned above using a bunch of historical YTD quotes. The data suggests that there is a statistically significant correlation between GME and both the NYA and DJIA. The data didn\u2019t suggest that there is a significant relationship between IXIC and GME, but the data suggests you might be able to infer that there is actually a significant relationship. As GME rises the market responds by dropping. Based on this data, my prediction is that WSB and GME holders are currently controlling the overall health of the market. If this data is accurate, then GME can be used as a possible predictor of overall market trends and consequently, possibly help for not just GME indicators, but also prospective market strategies\/positions.\n\n**In short**, when **GME goes up**, the **market goes down**.\n\n**TLDR; for data:** I found that the NYA, DJIA, and IXIC are negatively correlated to GME. NYA ( NYA,**p =.0027\\*\\***), (DJIA, **p =.0018\\*\\***), (Nasdaq, p= 0.88)\n\n**START**\n\nI noticed that anytime GME is rallying up, my entire portfolio goes red. My thought process was that the hedge funds control such a large portion of the market that when they liquidate in order to battle GME the whole entire market falls as a result. However, whenever I mentioned this idea, I\u2019ve been met with opposition, so I decided to compare the GME to the market indices I mentioned above.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[GME, DJIA, IXIC, NYA, YTD DATA](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ijpbroximxj61.png?width=1251&format=png&auto=webp&s=479499bdf91390cd98ed099bf963ab656421f695)\n\nIf you look at the chart, big drops in all three indices line up perfectly with any large rise in GME price. Meaning, while the whole market collapses GME rises. The opposite is also true, as GME drops, the rest of the market rises. The trends based on these comparisons suggest that GME is to some degree controlling the entire market. I decided to use some statistics so I can see the likelihood that these are \u201ccoincidences\u201d as many have suggested.\n\n**PROCESS**\n\nI calculated covariance, correlation, and p test matrices based on YTD data from yahoo finance of GME, NYA, DJIA, IXIC.  All data can be found there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Covariance & Correlation Matrices.](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/msw9tittmxj61.png?width=364&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1b76728b60bb58ae1b42c40ee3c0c6de3e80553)\n\n[P values. Statistically significant values highlighted.](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/gwdaxycymxj61.png?width=360&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd89e780bd3a85713d72d6e7a94b249d166c3fd0)\n\nThe results show that there is clear covariance between GME and all of the markets I mentioned. The correlation suggests that there is a moderate negative correlation between GME and the markets, but that makes sense given the vast size of the indices. But what was most important was the p values between GME and the NYA\/DJIA. For those that are not into statistics, the p-value is essentially the percentage that the relationships are based on \u201cluck\u201d or \u201cchance\u201d. It is accepted and utilized in the scientific community to establish statistical significance. Any p-value less than .05 is considered statistically significant. A p-value less than .05 basically says that there is less than a 5% chance that the relationships are due to \u201cluck\u201d. As you can see there is a .27% chance that the NYA dropping is random and a .18% chance for the DJIA. While the IXIC does not fit the bill, I believe significance can still be inferred based on the incredibly low p values when comparing NYA to IXIC, or when comparing DJIA to IXIC.\n\n**So, what does this mean?**\n\n**My opinions.**\n\nTo me, this means that GME does not just signify a battle between the poor and the uber-rich, but rather a battle for the entire market. On January 26, the DJIA dropped 600 points, the IXIC 300 points, and NYA 400 points with just a $266 dollar increase in GME. Imagine what would happen if GME hit a thousand dollars? At this point, you may be worried that GME may Impact the whole market, and while that should initially cause worry, when you remember the fact that the top 10% own 88% of the ENTIRE market, you should realize that it is not our market that would be impacted, it's *theirs*.\n\nMy opinion is that if the short squeeze happens, we will witness the largest liquidation event in the history of the market and alongside that, the largest redistribution of wealth that not just our society has seen, but larger than any society in history has ever seen. That liquidation would lower the barrier of entry to the market so significantly, that the people would have the opportunity to claim their spot in the market.\n\n**Final thoughts\/ Disclaimers.**\n\nAnyway, this is just something I wanted to share, not trying to convince anyone to do anything, to buy anything, or not to buy anything. None of this is a fact, it is vulnerable to error, and can be completely wrong but just wanted to contribute my thought process and my research in a meaningful way to the handful of you that may appreciate it. I would love feedback, especially if there are any statisticians out there! I also want to clarify, that this was based on limited YTD data. I tried getting ahold of more meaningful data but apparently, websites charge crazy prices for that sort of stuff. If anyone has access to quality data, I would love to sink my teeth into it.\n\nI AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR\n\n**Edit:** Wow, I am beyond grateful at all of the support and encouragement I received from the community, Thank you all so much\n\nI also wanted to address a lot of the common criticisms about statistical analysis. Specifically about the one that goes along the lines of \"correlation does not imply causation\". **There is no such thing as a statistical test that can prove causality. Correlation** is a measure for the **\"strength\"** of a relationship, meaning, it measures the impact that movement in one variable makes on the other variable. In a statistical context, the term \"significant\" is not just a buzz word or a strong adjective, it carries mathematical weight which is established by the **P-test**. The P-test essentially measures the **likelihood** that the correlation between 2 variables is **unrelated**. meaning it measures the odds that a correlation is just based on chance or luck. If you look on the labels of nutrition items, if in the corner of a claim you see a little \"\\*\" it means that statement was deemed statistically significant. For instance, vitamin b 12 claims \" helps turn food into cellular energy\\*\" while other vitamins make claims with no \"\\*\".\n\nIn layman's terms the p-test with regards to GME and NYA basically says that according to the data provided, there is a **.27% chance** that the two are **UNRELATED or a 99.73%** chance they are related.  In the scientific community, anything below 5% or less than .05 is considered statistically significant.\n\nAlso, I didn't just test correlation, I also tested covariance. Covariance is not the same as correlation. **Covariance** measures the **direction** of the relationship. In this case, the very large negative values are indicative of an **inverse** relationship. Meaning when one goes up, the other one goes down.\n\nSo with that in mind, this analysis provides a measure for the **direction** of the relationship, the **strength** of the relationship, and the **statistical significance** of the relationship. Apart from that, it does not say why or how they related. That is purely speculation, and I clearly labeled my speculations as to my opinions and you are all free to make your own speculations off of the data, I am not convincing you to buy into mine.\n\nLastly, I've seen a few comments that were quickly deleted that questioned the quality of my data. All I have to say is that I spent hours looking for better data and was met with buy walls to the tune of [500 dollars](https:\/\/firstratedata.com\/cb\/1\/complete-us-stocks-index-etf-futures) per data set. Not to mention a Bloomberg terminal that costs 24k a year.  If someone has access to better quality data please make it publicly accessible and I will be thrilled to redo the analysis with it.\n\nOther than that, Thank you all so much for the support and awards !!\n\n**Edit #2,** The first step to solidifying any scientific proposal is reproducibility. u\/big_boolean took the initiative and reproduced the correlation between GME and DJIA. He got a correlation coefficient of -0.53 which is close to mine of -0.49.\n\n[u\\\/big\\_boolean Graph](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/uu51ljdpsyj61.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=23556405c1362f35eab8932dca9927ff9b075c69)\n\nFor those who would like to help reproduce or challenge the post, post your results, and I will add them on. For reference, I used 2 degrees of freedom for my calculations.\n\n**Edit#3** I've started to notice a lot of experts commenting that have a much better and in-depth understanding of applied statistics than I do. To all of you experts, I welcome your criticism. Being that experts in statistics are an incredibly rare breed, I would really appreciate it if you all propose actional propositions that I can take a swing at myself, or better yet I'm sure the community as a whole would appreciate it if you took action and provided your own DD considering you are experts in your fields. If you do decide to provide suggestions if you could list them in stepwise instructions that would be even better. **Pointing out problems\/faults is important, but providing actionable solutions even more so!**","363":"Two Pokemon Games announced: New Consoles --> Pokemon Pokemon dropped two long anticipated games for the switch for November and 2022.

But it's honest work. \n\n[Fuel for my Fiat fund.

It didn't crap itself to the bottom like every other high IV stock out there. It just kind of squeezed to the middle with no real action overall. Theta gang had happy times here. But ... theta gang happiness also means there's consolidation in the waters. Consolidation in the waters means there's room for upswing (or downswing), but prob not much sideways trading for much longer.  GME went from \ud83d\ude36 to \ud83d\ude10 to \ud83d\ude80 to \ud83d\udca6 to \ud83d\udca5 to \ud83d\ude80 to \ud83d\ude10 back to \ud83d\ude80 and then  \ud83d\ude10\/\ud83d\ude36 ever since. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Other notable crayons:** \n\nMoney flow is increasing. That's a good thing especially when you see consolidation in the waters. \n\nBad signs I see are that it's GME and everyone hates on it these days + the selloffs in the past few months mean that we're not at the precipice of \ud83d\ude80 or \ud83d\udca6 tomorrow, but so likely by ... hopefully November 19th (..cough..cough). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR: \u23f3..\ud83d\udd1c..**\ud83d\ude10 to \ud83d\ude80 to \ud83d\udca6","720":"GME spikes once every 2-3 months? Like a lot of you I lost quite a lot of money on GME during the craze earlier in the year.  I then lost even more playing with GME options over time and stopped touching it around May (I think).\n\nAnyway, after I saw it spike a few times, and maintain a much higher price than it was at right before and after January, I started looking at it again.  I noticed that it seems like it spikes once every 2-3 months.  Obviously something happening 3 times isn't proof that it's going to keep happening, and nothing is for sure in the market of course... but I'm wondering what all of you Wendy's cashiers think.  Is there a reason it seems to run a cycle?\n\nDaily chart: https:\/\/ibb.co\/NpXQgxF","721":"The Current State of the Meme: Dying Off or Calm Before Round 3 of the Frenzy? In this post we're going to check on all of our favorite meme stonks and see if they've got anything left in the tank from a technical analysis standpoint. Come one and come all and hear my tale, whether you're a distraught bagholder ape or someone looking to get in on what I believe may be the final moonshot. Not a financial advisor blah blah blah you know the thing.\n\nFirst off, none of these plays work without Meme Stonk Frenzy Round 3. We had Round 1 late January with GME being the big runner, round 2 early June with AMC melting faces, and while this doesn't make Round 3 a sure thing, I'd like to think retail isn't dead, the shorts haven't covered, and with Tesla being overbought as hell and the Trump Pump near a conclusion, money will flow back into the MEMES.\n\n[The Big Triangle Thingy You've Probably Seen 1,000 Times Already](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/7wz09ua0vvv71.jpg?width=1841&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=29b78952cc21ea41be357476a63d691169d2ddf7)\n\nAh yes. The fan favorite. I often wonder if u\/TheRoaringKitty has secretly cashed in his tendies and escaped all this madness, but then I remember he's not a paper handed b\\*tch, as I'm sure all of you aren't either. Either way, the GME saga could be coming to a massive close in the form of one last big move. Having briefly just broken below the 200 day simple moving average yesterday and bouncing back well, a break to the upside could make everything right in the world once again and bring GME back near 300 territory. A break and hold below the 200 MA is a possible sign of more downside to come. I have to admit the risk to reward here is juicy and am looking to fire up a few 200C  Jan 2022 and will add more upon confirmation of a breakout  of this massive triangle to 300 and beyond. Green line I have there is around 250 where it may be wise to take profits as the hedgies will try to short ladder attack as the perevious resistance of 240ish is broken. Oh yeah and the yellow line is beginning of 2022 so if we don't get a move by then we're prob fucked imo.\n\nGME TLDR: hold 200 MA, breakout top of triangle, then moon.\n\n[Another Triangle Thingy but Not Quite as Big](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/d28ufb91yvv71.jpg?width=1829&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dc047671ee092bccd4412db8eeb2a0c5ee12c3bb)\n\nAnd now for the second meme that has become many apes meme stonk of choice. This guy has been coiling for a while since the absolute monster rip and like GME could be primed for another move. Sitting at the bottom of our nicely developing trendline, this is another great risk to reward opportunity. 50 would be a take profit zone as the shorts will look to hold it down there at previous resistance but hey, we know you apes aren't selling for that cheap. Red line could be a stop loss for those of you with wrinklier brains at about 32. 200 MA is catching up but not really a factor like GME. Break of 50 MA could easily fuel us to break the wedge and then to 50 and beyond.\n\nAMC TLDR: hold lower trendline, break top of triangle, then moon\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Different Triangle Thingy Already Broken to Upside](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/16y3bd712wv71.jpg?width=1833&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b3aa8314e63d9eac4c37e89f296758ce13e1c98a)\n\nDon't think I forgot about the meme stonk little brother, BB. This was to many not nearly on the same level as GME or AMC, but my how the tables have turned. This meme has actually gotten a LOT of good news (not going to include here but check it out) and many consider it to be more a fundamental play than meme at this point. But don't let them fool you, BB will be there aboard the rocket ship too when Round 3 begins. Already broke our wedge with nice volume a few days ago and has pulled back nicely to the 200 MA. Hold of this and a break above that blue dotted line near 12.25 should get us back to 15+ in no time.\n\nTLDR: Hold 200 MA, break 12.25, then moon.\n\nThese are just the big 3 I've seen upside in, but I'm sure there's many more memes to be had. Be fully prepared to lose all the money you put in as an options play, but if you go stocks then you can control your risk a lot better. Don't take this as real financial advise, as I'm just a fellow retard looking to be ready for Meme Frenzy Round 3.","722":"The power of cult: Why I think DWAC is primed to move higher and so will other similar cult stocks Do you know about AAPL, the original cult stock?\n\nWell, it\u2019s now the largest company in the world.\n\nThe AAPL cult is now not so vocal, because it has matured. \n\nDIS cult, Nintendo cult etc have made their companies huge players in their respective industries. Now they are just dormant.\n\nLet's come back to some present day cults. AMD, Valve(private company) and NVDA are the biggest pc gaming related cults that are out there. Go to r\/pcmasterrace or other similar places, the cult vibe is relentless and unending. Their only position being: INTC and Epic(private company) bad. AMD, NVDA, Valve daddies good.\n\nAnd look at the stock price of AMD and NVDA!! They speak volume of the power of that cult!\n\nOf course, PTON the workout cult is also a good example to showcase this example or NKE.\n\nCult stocks generally have higher valuation relative to their peers or their valuation may even be nonsensical.\n\nI am kinda a AMD cult person(indoctrinated by the pcmasterrace cult), but let me demonstrate the valuation difference by comparing AMD and INTC.\n\nAMD has almost 73% market cap of INTC. This would indicate that ultimately AMD would have 73% of the discounted free cash flow of INTC. Is that likely? Hell no.\ud83d\ude02\nINTC is much more diversified and has almost 6 times more revenue than AMD and even the most optimistic projections won't make that prediction.\n\nBut does that mean INTC will keep a larger market cap than AMD within 1 or 2 year? No, I think the opposite will happen, AMD will surpass INTC in market cap regardless of fundamentals.\n\nIt\u2019s supply and demand. Cult followers not just buy their product, but also the stock (I think).\n\nAlso, there are cults surrounding GME, AMC stocks and if those cults are long lasting, well, elevated valuation is highly likely.\n\n\nNow, let us talk about the current biggest cult of all. TSLA. Need I say anything?\nIf the cult is to be believed, TSLA will have 3 trillion in robotaxi, solar energy and other revenues within 2025 or something. \n(I am not saying you shouldn\u2019t buy TSLA, my whole post is about showing the power of cult)\n\nAs long as there is a cult which has buying power and buys the product+stock, the stock would reward one handsomely.\n\nWith all that prologue, I have recently started browsing some online discussion circles, and I think DWAC is a similar big cult in the making. They have a huge portion of the populace by the balls as potential customers and regardless of what their product is, if the cult has staying power (which I believe it does), the product would hardly matter.\n\nTL;DR: Invest in cult. Invest in DWAC and other similar cults.\n\n\nEdit: I haven't mentioned some cults as I don't wanna get banned(cry ptos, tell me what value they actually produce), other cults could include companies like LULU or Yeti. And my original intention was to see some other tickers that have similar cult vibes, looks like the discussion just became too focused on a single ticker.","723":"ENVX Battery Tech Spec Play? Alright tards,\n\nI've been on a bit of a hiatus from this sub. It's taken me a while to see a reason to return and not just lurk but I have stumbled upon a seemingly credible reason to return and talk about some other stocks other than my beloved GME, AMC, BB, PLTR, etc. \n\nSo I was watching Meet Kevin interview Marc Cohodes yesterday, https:\/\/youtu.be\/3MDW6x6nJTE , and at the end Kevin asks him about some of the names he is into and Marc responds with a good discussion about battery tech, highly recommend giving a listen, and the company he is invested in that is in this space, Enovix(ENVX). I started doing my own research on this company and stumbled upon a battery day video from a few months back, https:\/\/youtu.be\/r8mvMeaa3t0 , in which the CEO, Harrold Rust, is discussing what his company does and why they are poised to DOMINATE! Highly recommend giving this a listen to as well. I am extremely bullish on this stock and would love to see a discussion start around them. They went public via SPAC months ago and have a primary focus of raising capital. The founders, CEO included, are all buddies who worked at IBM back in the day and I think this could be a game changer! Cohodes also pointed out that battery tech and the industry, especially utilizing high amounts of silicon, could become a national security issue with all that is going on in the broader market right now. Something to think about. Need some Apes to get that capital formation going and this bitch will fly!\n\nTL;DR Enovix(ENVX) is poised to DOMINATE the future of battery. They have made leaps in the area of architecture and due to this, they are able to accomplish battery performance that absolutely fucks current leaders in the pooper. CEO says they are aimed at raising capital and once they have that, they can begin to really show their balls.\n\n\nEdit 1: Options look poised to cause SERIOUS gamma ramp with $30 strike price being the highest for the shortest term contracts(19 November) and a history of being able to jump that much in price in less time than a month. Current price is around $22. This could be a play that yields SERIOUS returns. Capital formation gets to a point that the company can start making moves and this thing is going to RUNNNNN \ud83d\ude80","724":"Running of the Memes Part 5 - Big Breakouts In Multiple Meme Stocks Noticed many meme stock technical breakouts are lining up - just like every time they go on a huge run.

Thoughts? Disclaimer: This is not dd. This is opening a discussion for a certain factor of the gme report that is causing controversy\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: the data in figure 6 does NOT include all the shorts. It is merely a representative sample of shorts. Looking at the absolute quantity of shorts buying here is meaningless. However, given that it still seems odd to me that in the period between Feb 6th and Feb 12th, a massive quantity of shorts (something like 100% of the float) must have been covered according to this graph without any noticeable effect on price. Comments are disappearing for me for some reason and I am going to sleep. Play nice and stop downvoting comments posing resolutions other than higher than reported short interest into the ground. This is a discussion thread. Not a GME circle jerk thread. We are working through this report together to make sense of it and the purpose of this thread is to find clarity on something that seemed off to me and a bunch of other individuals not to just try to hype.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is a lot of speculation about whether the GME report suggests that shorts have not closed. The core of this comes down to the seeming disparity between this figure 5 and figure 6 of the report.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/x2pvs79nfdu71.png?width=645&format=png&auto=webp&s=acd07db860fbef8fa7ca174479e2292812df46b3\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ssomo32zfdu71.png?width=618&format=png&auto=webp&s=24fd26f5e629a2e944ecac2ae22c4a937b1263b9\n\n~~The figure 5 graph suggests that short interest fell by as much a 30% pre-new year  which corresponds to a necessary buy volume of 21 million shares. Yet, when we look at figure 6, the cumulative buy volume by short-sellers doesn't seem to come close.~~ (I'm retarded and don't know my months apparently) Additionally, by feb 12 the short interest was reported around 30% (according to marketbeat) which translates to an almost 100% drop in si. A drop that big would require an average short buy volume of 4.4 million per day (70 mil\/16 days). Yet figure 6 shows data not even close to that figure. This would imply extremely high levels of covering between febuary 5th and febuary 12th which doesn't seem reflected in the price action over that period.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat do the 'apes' say: Many individuals who are bullish on gme believe that this is evidence that the short interest data being reported is faulty in some manner. They believe that the low penalties for misrepresenting short interest are causing short hedge funds to underreport their positions. We all know that the short interest heavily affects the price movement of GameStop so this has some plausibility. Others suggest that the positions are being hidden through ftds or option tomfoolery. This is potentially less plausible because the reports specifically talks about ftds and it seems like they would have mentioned options if they could hide shorts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat do the gay bears say: Many gay bears have generally responded by arguing that the 'apes' are seeing largely what they want to see. The report clearly states that the shorts covered and that the short interest is low (relatively speaking). Why would the SEC do something convoluted like make conflicting graphs? 'Apes' are being conspiratorial and are interpreting it wrong if they are getting such a bizarre result.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat are your interpretations of this data? I want to move the dialogue from unhelpful comment fights to here. (Any math I do is meant to be generally illustrative not 100% accurate)\n\nEdit: Yeah the graphs are not in the same time period, but still looking at them and given that nearly the entire float was closed between jan 27 and feb 12. Figure 6 is still odd-looking.\n\nEdit 2: Figure 6 is a bit misleading because of the size of the candles. Keep in mind while viewing that there was a huge amount of volume during this period in the realm of 100 mil a day. Still significant, but that does mean it is less than one would first think. Additionally, in the notes it makes clear that this is not all the short buy volume just those from big players. Thanks to u\/StonkGodCapital for raising that point. However, I would say that I still think it is odd that the report implies that so much covering (of almost an entire float worth of covering) occurred during the pre-February 12th, but post squeeze period despite us seeing very boring price movement in that period.","726":"CCL: The Last Reopening Play (Disclaimer, I'm long CCL with a combination of long calls and long shares. I am short a few covered calls with CCL shares of collateral too as a risk-management tool.)\n\nLots of my friends are apes, and I love that this subreddit has made them rich, so this is my attempt at giving back and making apes rich. I'm more of a Warren Buffett style investor, and I'm kinda anti social media so I have never posted here or even on Reddit. But CCL is an opportunity all investors should love, apes, speculators, and value investors alike.\n\nCCL is the last reopening play still trading at a 50% discount from it's pre-COVID peaks. This price is not justified: it is as undervalued as GME or AMC.\n\nRight now it\u2019s fallen to a support of 23 a share. Looking at the last times CCL fell to a support of 23 should show you the market is overlooking a big play.\n\nLast time we were at 23 was only September 18th 2021, and since then CCL has announced they are fully booked through 2023, and they\u2019ve refinanced a lot of high rate debt they put on earlier in the pandemic thus ending their liquidity crisis and giving them the cash on hand to expand their fleet further. Delta and United\u2019s earnings last week shows that travel stocks have recovered, or will soon recover. Merck's antiviral will further boost reopening plays. Americans have a well documented cash glut that will translate into luxury sales, like a cruise ship vacay. Even Morningstar, fucking Morningstar, agrees that 23 is a low price\u2013though their fair price of 27 still feels pretty low. \n\nIn fact, CCL is down from its recent high of 26 in September, down from 30 where it stood before the Delta variant stunted a number of reopening plays, and down from 60 where it was before the pandemic.\n\nHow can this be? Oh, because like GME and AMC it's a popular short target. The put to call ratio is 1.2. Definitely not as dramatic as AMC or GME was, but buying and holding will make a few hedgies cry.\n\nBecause the hedgies are so obviously fucking wrong on this. For 23 bucks, I am going to hold CCL and never let go, because owning a company with orders booked through 2023 and at half the price it was in 2019 is pretty fucking rad.\n\nIf you could see the deep fucking value in AMC and GME, you can see that CCL's value is as rich as the deep blue sea. I'm hodling, feel free to get rich with me.\n\nLinks:\n\nHedge Funds are Dumping CCL (lol this article was published while I was writing this post): [https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/hedge-funds-dumping-carnival-corporation-152552278.html](https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/hedge-funds-dumping-carnival-corporation-152552278.html)\n\nCarnival Corporation (CCL) Announces More U.S. Homeport Ship Restarts for January and February 2022:\n\n[https:\/\/www.investorsobserver.com\/news\/stock-update\/carnival-corporation-ccl-announces-more-u-s-homeport-ship-restarts-for-january-and-february-2022](https:\/\/www.investorsobserver.com\/news\/stock-update\/carnival-corporation-ccl-announces-more-u-s-homeport-ship-restarts-for-january-and-february-2022)\n\nCarnival Corporation: Liquidity Crisis Averted\n\n[https:\/\/seekingalpha.com\/article\/4459615-carnival-corporation-stock-liquidity-crisis-averted](https:\/\/seekingalpha.com\/article\/4459615-carnival-corporation-stock-liquidity-crisis-averted)","727":"Hedging against a Market Crash, 2008' all over again Hey everyone,\n\nI did put a lot of research into the current situation for quite some time and finally build a portfolio I am 100% behind long-term. However, the more I learned, the more sure I am that we will experience a market crash rather soon, than late.\n\nI am not here to debate whether or not you think this is true, but the situation for this thought game is that we might see a crash similar in numbers, **not principle** like 2008' all over again. In general, during times of high inflation, most businesses will not come out well. The earnings will go up, but they need to put more money into their own business to even stay in the same place. A hedge for this are companies that can easily scale their business without needing money flow. I am looking at you Facebook, who can place 10% more ads, Adobe who can increase their product price without fear of losing customers, Apple, Microsoft...\n\nThe theory behind this discussion would assume that GameStop is a good hedge, I even heard that from the high ups in a very big, German bank, which is incredibly weird since they were against it months ago and did not even want to talk about it in the first place. This assumes that the crash is happening because of said theory I explained below in short. It does not mean that a high percentage of the entire portfolio should persist of them, but a chunk just in case might be a very good idea. The market is more complex than many think.\n\nAnother hedge and long term hold can not be mentioned in this sub, but you might guess what it is. Sadly, we cant debate this here. Has to do with weird blocks and tokens, latter of which might change the whole gaming industry and I am thankfully in the position where I can take constant profits from it in percentages that sound absolutely insane.\n\nSo, in case of this **theoretical** scenario, I would like to get everyone's opinion on this. I want to be clear, I value every single opinion and would love the most input possible. In case of no crash, my investments should grow steadily, but in case of a crash due to named circumstance, they would skyrocket. Again, this is purely theoretical, I do not want to discuss whether or not it is happening, but what you would do in case it will happen in the near future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR: How would you hedge against a potential market crash ala 2008' (similar in numbers, not principle) due to Evergrande + GameStop and the overall market situation?**\n\n*I will add the theory behind GameStop again, even though most of you might know this already.*\n\n*The theory: Most part of the stock is traded in Dark Pools and some shorting Hedge Funds are telling us that they closed their position, which is mathematically impossible. Do the research yourself. What I think is happening, is that all the shorts are actually synthetic and not real shares. There is tons and tons of proof of it, too much to even deny at this point. They exercise and sell deep ITM calls in order to get the FTDs. So basically, they are passing them from one to another, to another.*  \n***The endless cycle:***  \n*Person 1: Exercise deep ITM calls > Person 2: Sells deep ITM calls > Person 3: Sells shares > Person 4: met his FTD > Person 5: Exercise deep ITM calls  > Person 6: Sells deep ITM calls > \u2026*\n\n***Explanation for Golden Retriever:***  \n*Think of it like this, a good analogy; You get a credit card with 10.000$ on it, max it out and have to repay the debt next month. However, you have endless credit cards, so you can get another credit card and \"pay\" the 10.000$ with that. The debt is still there, its just getting passed. You can do that forever. Now you need more money, so you do this all over again and keep digging the grave deeper and deeper. In this theory, multiple times the float and continuing. In order to stop that, you have to lock the float entirely, which is why everyone is currently directly registering their shares.* ***IF*** *this is true, I do not have to explain the potential outcome. There is simply too much proof.*\n\n*Computershare confirmed this.*  \n*Quote from their Twitter: \"Shares held directly on the books of US companies through a transfer agent are not held at DTCC. As such, shares are not available to be loaned for any means within the security markets. Computershare is a registered transfer agent, therefore does not lend shares in any capacity.\"*\n\n*Cheers, have a nice week everyone!*","728":"$GME: Possible Near-Term Technical Breakout Hi, gang.

If this happens I think it will run to at least the August high at about $230 and could go much higher if the Ape Army returns.\n\nDecember Earnings and the holiday shopping season are also potential catalysts for a run, but we probably also need the overall market to stop bleeding for this to play out.\n\nI think it could continue to be rangebound for another couple weeks, but we are setting up for a big move one way or another after that.

Console manufacturers are moving to digital delivery instead of physical games (38% of GME revenue). Meanwhile physical consoles, which make up over 49% of GME revenue, is only sold on 4 year cycles--and sold at all competing retailers.\n\nCreate a GME coin that consoles can mine, while powered on and connected to the internet. Users then spend GME Coins online to buy games, in-game items, and cosmetics--competing with Free to Play (F2P) market while supporting game publishers. GME sells the mining processing power to host games and CDNs, turning GME into a technology company.\n\n**Context**\n\nYou are tasked with drafting the turnaround strategy for GameStop, an online and brick-and-mortar retail store specializing in console games and accessories. The chairman for the board, Ryan Cohen, began his turnaround of the business in 2020, aiming to make GameStop the \u201cAmazon of Gaming\u201d. Recent \u201cMeme Stock\u201d speculation of the company's stock has driven the price of shares from $15 to as high as $483 in less than a year. As of September 20, 2021 the stock now trades at $189 per share.\n\n**Assumptions**\n\nGameStop has full alignment with Microsoft (Xbox) and Sony (Playstation) to build the \u201cnext generation\u201d of gaming. In the wake of the Epic vs. Apple lawsuit, Microsoft and Sony have determined that retailers such as GameStop are necessary and, for fear of antitrust regulations, have committed to a strong collaboration with GameStop. You have counterparts at both companies working to launch this new product offering. Ryan Cohen is interested in a serious turnaround strategy, to help justify the recent $10 Billion Dollar valuation by share price.\n\n**Challenges to the GameStop business model**\n\nDuring the Covid-19 pandemic, online retailers, digital game platforms, and online services grew the most due to the \u201cstay at home\u201d nature of pandemic restrictions. These companies saw increased revenue, online users, and engagement ([source](https:\/\/www.barrons.com\/articles\/stay-at-home-stocks-have-been-crushed-here-are-ones-that-could-still-win-long-term-51621036411)). GameStop\u2019s second quarter earnings of $1.18 Billion dollars of sales, yet reported an operating loss of $.76 per share. GameStop revenue came from 49.7% Hardware and Accessories (Consoles, controllers, adapters, etc), 38.9% Software (used and new video games), and 11.4% Collectibles (figurines, magazines, etc).\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/gvp45w5h5eq71.png?width=994&format=png&auto=webp&s=80a189cc248d650230faa1e85252dd4d1892ac01\n\nThe major consoles that contributed to GameStops revenue were the Playstation 5 and Xbox Series One. In the recent Epic vs. Apple lawsuit, when asked how much margin Microsoft makes on the Xbox consoles, the head of Xbox business development stated, \u201cWe don\u2019t; we sell the consoles at a loss\u201d. This is because the console market is a \u201chardware subsidy model, where game companies sell the consoles at a loss to attract new customers. Profits are then generated from game sales and online service subscriptions ([source](https:\/\/www.news18.com\/news\/tech\/microsoft-sells-xbox-consoles-for-a-loss-but-the-xbox-gaming-business-makes-money-3715331.html)).\n\nEach major game console manufacturer creates new consoles every four years on average, which creates growth challenges to GameStop in interim years between releases. An additional challenge to GameStop\u2019s future revenue is that each manufacturer operates online digital stores for instant purchasing of games, which is quicker to play than even Amazon can ship. It is estimated that around 50% of console and PC game sales are now being made through an online purchase. Adding insult to injury, both Microsoft and Playstation offer consoles without digital disc drives, requiring digital purchases to operate.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/8oinqe1n5eq71.png?width=930&format=png&auto=webp&s=87642bdceb199637d685574151f7187bf5ea600a\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/6jnphvuu5eq71.png?width=1008&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ad77c6d92c331c85b1655ae05228eb2b48a1830\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/43jwbbdw5eq71.png?width=880&format=png&auto=webp&s=15ddee48f6f1a306a14190f9295d409eb7071736\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/mc7nzn646eq71.png?width=1076&format=png&auto=webp&s=5211fe1ededf644821da80b6b1e473908cfbb742\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/gcbxjbi66eq71.png?width=920&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad8e767f4b5cc2e6659acbcf0f50fc610da1f6e1\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/xjld30ob6eq71.png?width=1010&format=png&auto=webp&s=e31d223ab51937b2727af8eec83fbc268e5c6654\n\n**Analysis**\n\nGameStops customers are increasingly purchasing digital copies of games directly from Microsoft, Playstation, or Nintendo, instead of physical copies from brick and mortar stores. It\u2019s estimated that 50% of sales are now digital, and growing.\n\n1. GameStop could work with publishers directly to offer subscription models for new games, exclusive content, or digital expansions, fronting the development costs by capitalizing their market share.\n2. GameStop could try to become the \u201cAmazon of Gaming\u201d by increasing their fulfillment and logistics chains to deliver physical copies of games and hardware quicker to customers, competing for market share of fixed price products.\n3. GameStop could broaden their hardware offerings to include Gaming PC\u2019s, laptops, and other hardware accessories, transitioning into more of a Best Buy ($29 Billion Valuation).\n4. GameStop could utilize their 4,000+ Brick and Mortar stores to perform services such as computer repair, and specialty services.\n5. Leverage GameStop\u2019s brand halo to create experiential events focused around their favorite games with exclusive \u201cdrops\u201d and releases.\n\nSWOT Matrix (Figure 1) and Porters 5 Forces (Figure 2), show that there are increasing threats to the GameStop retailer business model, not only from traditional competitors (Best Buy, Walmart), but also from online retailers such as Amazon and direct-to-consumer marketplaces (Xbox, Playstation, Nintendo Stores). The PEST analysis (Figure 4) shows that marketplaces have a unique sensitivity in today's legal atmosphere that can be utilized to negotiate with Console Manufacturers. Marketing Mix (Figure 5) shows that GameStop does not have a unique marketing position or product offering to leverage. Amazon fuels it\u2019s growth from nascent businesses by utilizing it\u2019s profits from Cloud (AWS) while operating at scale to decrease costs while increasing selection. Amazon even created its own last mile delivery and transport hubs to reduce costs and compete with FedEx and UPS. It\u2019s not feasible for GameStop to do so.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ao50evpe6eq71.png?width=442&format=png&auto=webp&s=578b562722fbbb7379be64c25ae2c2685bc8c457\n\nIn analyzing the current market, positioning of GameStop, and threats to the business, GameStop\u2019s future is not certain. GameStop risks following in [RadioShack](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/articles\/investing\/081315\/5-reasons-why-radioshack-went-out-business.asp) or Circuit City\u2019s footsteps.\n\n**Recommendation**\n\nGameStop should continue to leverage its sales of Console hardware, accessories, physical games, and used games\/trade-ins for the near term. Instead of redeveloping their supply, logistics, and fulfillment chains to maximize delivery speed, GameStop should leverage it\u2019s existing relationships with manufacturers and game publishers to receive inventory of releases early, and ship with promised delivery with UPS\/Fedex. This allows low cost shipping options to be utilized without expensive logistic routes. Fervent fans can still receive their games or consoles on Day 1, but without the upfront [CAPEX costs](https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2021\/08\/24\/walmart-launches-delivery-business-to-connect-other-local-retailers-with-consumers.html) to GameStop.\n\nUltimately, Judo Strategy (Figure 6) suggests GameStop must find ways to use their opponents' weight and strength against them, rather than emulating what their competitors are already doing well. Drastic steps need to be taken to compete against existing and future incumbents. To increase high-value engagements with GameStop that correlate to retention (eg \u201cStickiness\u201d), GameStop should create a digital wallet that allows customers to collect \u201ccoins\u201d that they can spend to purchase new games, cosmetics, or in-game purchases.\n\nUtilizing GameStops close relationship with Microsoft and Sony, GameStop should create a console app that performs hosting functions (mining) while connected to the internet. Porters 5 forces (Figure 2) shows that these consoles have expensive GPUs that can perform significant processing functions for centralized servers. [Many server farms today](https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/take-a-look-inside-an-underground-crypto-farm-busted-by-ukraine-police-2021-7) mine cryptocurrencies with consoles due to these strong GPUs.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/h6vrukth6eq71.png?width=902&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf918fc5d54a68f15a009e9df526842e63b9032e\n\nGameStop customers can then load this application and earn coins for every hour of hosting functions they perform for the collective platform. The hosting services could enable decentralized hosting of online video games and GameStops own e-commerce website. If a customer leaves the app on, performing hosting functions for the decentralized server for one hour, they would earn 1 credit. A new video game release may cost 1,000 credits, in-game cosmetics 500 credits. Credits could also be purchased directly from GameStop instead of mining. This would enable game publishers to create additional mirrors of their games online to prevent ever [increasing DDOS hacks](https:\/\/www.pcgamer.com\/apex-legends-hacked-to-protest-titanfalls-server-situation\/) which cost publishers millions while frustrating customers. This JUDO strategy allows GameStop to shift and compete in a whole new way, while the industry cuts out middlemen with Free-To-Play, digital downloads, and in-app purchases.\n\n**Measuring Success**\n\nEach customer's wallet would be tied to their GameStop account. This customer data would be aggregated to identify unique users. Aged GameStop accounts could be renewed and tied to new wallets. Mining\/hosting, spending coins, purchasing coins, and browsing the coin marketplace would be high value engagements (HVEs). As the gaming industry shifts completely to digital games, which could occur as soon as four years from now, GameStop can leverage this hosting strategy to grow revenue directly for game publishers, while competing with \u201cFree to Play\u201d games. This enables game publishers to continue to create high budget games, without charging exorbitant prices to customers ([which data shows customers are resistant to pay](https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/01\/18\/free-to-play-games-rule-the-entertainment-world-with-88-billion-in-revenue\/)).\n\n**Implementation**\n\nYou would work with the new Sr. Platform Manager of Xbox and Playstation (see assumptions section above), to select three pilot game publishers for this launch. They may include Epic Games (Apex Legends) and Activision (Call of Duty), among others.\n\nThe initial MVP would comprise the following headcount:\n\n1. Two Engineers (Xbox and Playstation App Development)\n2. Four Engineers (Mining\/Hosting experts with Content Delivery Network Experience)\n3. One Engineer (Ledger system to calculate payouts, spending, etc)\n4. Three Engineers (Flex, QA)\n5. Four Game Advocates (Work directly with the pilot Game publishers)\n6. One Marketing Specialists (Work directly with PR for news release on launch day)\n7. One Engineer (Coin Spending Storefront)\n\nAfter MVP development, the idea could be iterated on to improve hosting utilization and even sell spare hosting to the general web hosting marketplace. This would include cloud content delivery networks similar to Cloud Flare ($38 Billion Valuation).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Would you leave your console on to mine game coins?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Important Note: I have no holdings in GME or interest in the company.

So this week, let\u2019s see how the most reputed brands have performed over the last decade!\n\n[ ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/e1y8b3xtp8q71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=050451ab56c0dd05014ff5207231fc40766dadcf)\n\n**Data**\n\nWhile there are multiple companies that measure reputation, I chose the [RepTrack](https:\/\/www.reptrak.com\/) list for my analysis as they seem to be the most established ones and have been creating their top 100 list for the last 2 decades.\n\nThey base their study on more than 240K responders over 15+ countries and the rating tells us how the companies are regarded by the general public. They have multiple factors that go into the final ranking, but for this analysis, I am only considering the final rank of the company.\n\nI am considering the companies that were present in the Top 10 list at least once in the last decade \\[2012 - 2021\\]\n\n[ ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/w05hhrxtp8q71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=5827fd247cb15d12bd50ac6746134c6bb6dac330)\n\n**Analysis**\n\nRepTrack publishes their result in March, every year. Since I could not find any fixed date of publication, for the purpose of the stock price calculation, I am using April 1st of every year as my investment date.\n\nEven though the company produces a Top 100 list, I have limited my analysis to the Top 10 companies \\[3\\]. We then calculate the stock returns generated by these companies \\[4\\] over various time periods (1-year, 3-years, 5-years & till date) and then compare it to our benchmark. \\[5\\]\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/serqaextp8q71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=18f15aea04e8a6decc25ff972c0bb01110d65bb5\n\n **Results** \n\n[ ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/hdjeau7zp8q71.png?width=953&format=png&auto=webp&s=a50598f9162d4b211dce3f202ff26e87296c52d8)\n\nCompanies in the most reputable list have consistently beaten SPY over different time periods. There is a significant improvement in overall return when holding the investment for a longer-term.\n\nMy hypothesis here is that, even though the short-term returns can be affected by market cycles, over the long run, companies having a great reputation end up outperforming their peers, and this is reflected in their stock price.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/shv1yw10q8q71.png?width=761&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b85dbf0596b22f9d93bfa3f1cd954f012e9e796\n\n Another interesting insight we can derive from the data is the performance of the top-10 companies in each year\u2019s list. As we can see, the most reputable brands beat SPY by a considerable margin in 7\/10 years \\[6\\]. \n\n[ ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/m10k3451q8q71.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=af6fb32d2245b0a5bc5d157d0931a91872716761)\n\nBut, before you YOLO your next paycheck into this strategy, do note that most of the returns were contributed by tech companies \\[5\\]. This is expected given the tech rally we had over the past decade. What is more interesting is how difficult it is to lose money investing in the top brands. Only 4 companies that were in the top 10 list over the past decade had a negative return. \n\n[ ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/gz1th2ytp8q71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab684cf2e2d4a3584b1c3590965c804bba19c284)\n\n**Limitations to the Analysis**\n\nThere are some limitations to the above analysis that you should be aware of before trying to replicate the strategy.\n\n* Ideally, the backtest should be done over 30-40 year\u2019s worth of data as we would know how the changing trends would impact the analysis. The last decade or so was predominantly biased towards tech.\n* One should also benchmark this against the companies having an average or poor reputation to see if reputation is indeed a distinguishing factor that is driving the returns. \\[7\\]\n* Finally, reputation is just one factor related to the company. There are companies whose reputations are in the gutter but have produced extraordinary returns for their shareholders (Facebook gave 175% return & Volkswagen gave 117% return in the last 5 years even after all the scandals they have been through). \n\n[ ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/cp1acpytp8q71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=79a8269e8083fdbdf4f44e9ef093ee54ee2b73c1)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhether you like it or not, brands seem to have a significant impact on our daily lives.

They also hold the largest number of PUTs (80,702 contracts), twice as many as second in line Susquehanna, and are the highest percentage out (10.550%) among those listed.  All other PUTs have since been re-filed on **6\/30\/2021**.\n\nI believe these dates indicate historical Collateralized Loan Obligation (CLO) activity associated with GameStop and provide an indication of what to expect as we move towards **9\/30\/2021** and onward.\n\n### Background\n\nIn January, February 2021 $126.6 billion of loans were said to have been repriced ([S+P Global - March 12th, 2021](https:\/\/www.spglobal.com\/marketintelligence\/en\/news-insights\/latest-news-headlines\/quick-take-us-clo-refinancing-and-reset-activity-surges-63108875)).\n\nArchegos was liquidated between March 12th and March 26th, 2021 ([Credit Suisse - July 29th, 2021](https:\/\/www.credit-suisse.com\/media\/assets\/corporate\/docs\/about-us\/investor-relations\/financial-disclosures\/results\/csg-special-committee-bod-report-archegos.pdf)).  It\u2019s been said that the firm turned **$10 billion into an estimated $100 billion** worth of assets ([Bloomberg - April 3rd, 2021](https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/opinion\/articles\/2021-04-03\/the-number-of-the-week-is-100-billion)). \n\n> \u201cTypically, for new-issue transactions, the CLO debt tranches are collectively 10 times the size of the notional amount of the equity interest.\u201d - https:\/\/www.stout.com\/en\/insights\/article\/primer-valuation-clo-equity-financial-reporting\n\nOn March 26th, 2021 the Fed reported a daily Reverse Repurchase amount of $11.4 billion.  By March 31st, the daily Reverse Repurchase amount skyrocketed up to $134 billion.  An increase of $124.297 billion. ([St. Louis Federal Reserve - RRP Chart](https:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/series\/)).  This was notable because the Fed\u2019s RRP activity had been effectively dormant until this uptick.\n\n### Hypothesis\n\nAs evidenced by the volume of CLO repricing in Jan\/Feb, the end date of the Archegos liquidation, proportion of equity compared to total Archegos assets and uptick in RRPs on March 31st, 2021 my reading leads me to believe that Archegos was more of a CLO Manager than Family Office and that some of their positions (illiquid investments in junk-grade CLOs) were auctioned off and then repriced to SOFR at the end of March 2021.\n\nHistorically CLOs were priced off 3-month LIBOR but, out of concern the benchmark was being manipulated by financial institutions, the Federal Reserve is in the process of transitioning CLOs to their own rate called SOFR that is based on the daily RRP amounts ([Bloomberg - July 8th, 2021](https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2021-07-08\/growing-clo-market-has-a-libor-transition-problem-on-horizon)).\n\n9\/30\/2021 is 3 days away and represents the 2nd-ever quarterly refinancing of CLOs after the formal recommendation of SOFR was made by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee ([AARC](https:\/\/www.newyorkfed.org\/arrc)) on July 29th, 2021.\n\nThere is a process called \u201cWarehousing\u201d in the CLO world where \u201cCLO Managers purchase initial collateral before the closing date\u201d which typically lasts 3-6 months ([Pinebridge - September 19th, 2019](https:\/\/www.pinebridge.com\/en\/insights\/clo-beyond-the-complexity)).\n\n**9\/30\/2021 represents the 6-month mark since Simplex filed their 80,702 PUT contracts**.\n\nGME close on 3\/31\/2021: $189.82\n\nGME close on 6\/30\/2021: $214.14\n\nGME close on 9\/30\/2021: ???\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile many of my posts have historically shied away from dates I believe the evidence here is too clear and strong to avoid mention.  Worth noting 9\/30\/2021 is just *a* date and, given the fact the average tenor of Archegos\u2019 contracts was 24 months, there could be many other interesting ones as well.\n\nJust a Retail Investor, not a financial advisor.","742":"$TMC - SHEEP BEING LED TO SLAUGHTER Here are my past DD's so you know I'm not an idiot:\n\n[Shorts nearly cost 42,000 GME employees their jobs and livelihoods.

However what these posts do not mention, is that there are **203 million DeepGreen shares of which 55% are immediately unlocked.** I'm not denying that at the moment the acquisition closed and the 8-K was released on **September 9th,** the float was 2.7 million. However there are \\~100 million shares that have been eligible to be sold since then, so the **float has increased WAY BEYOND 2.7M SINCE THE CLOSE OF THE SPAC**. \n\n# DID YOU CHECK THE OP's CLAIMS BEFORE YOLOING?\n\nThe 2.7 million float thesis has been posted so much across WSB\/Stocktwits\/Twitter. So many times that everyone took it as fact. However this fact could be refuted with about 30 minutes of research on SEC EDGAR (free resource). If you paid for BamSEC ($35\/month), you could have probably found the evidence refuting this in about 5 minutes.\n\nHere's my thread on why the 2.7 million float was wrong, posted on **THURSDAY when the stock was at $12.34 (stock down \\~45% since then).**\n\n[Why are people lying about $TMC Float? Float is 100+ million, not 2.7 million LOL](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/ppu3d1\/why_are_people_lying_about_tmc_float_float_is_100\/) (Negative 47 upvotes, 48 comments)\n\nI haven't posted on WSB in 8 months but the pumping and lying about the float was so pathetic that I had to chime in. However people just called me retarded, so I loaded $5 puts.\n\n# DEEP GREEN SHAREHOLDERS - DESPERATE TO SELL\n\nI'm not going to go into the DD on the actual company. I think most here understand it's worth $0-$2 max and a squeeze based on 2.7 million float was the main thesis. DeepGreen shareholders understand this too and are clearly dumping the 55% of their shares that are unlocked. They are probably writing off their 6 month locked shares as worth $0. But they are still making bank because WSB and stocktwits are driving liquidity for them to dump.\n\n# WSB DRIVES LIQUIDITY SO INSIDERS CAN DUMP\n\nThis company is such a fraud and valuation so ridiculous that several PIPE investors reneged on their commitments and would rather take their chances in court then fund this thing. DeepGreen shareholders know this and are desperate to get out. To get out at reasonably inflated prices they need liquidity or this thing will go to zero as they all dump. Que the hundreds of posts on WSB pumping this thing. Even the buyers today scooping up 'cheapies' at $7 will get smoked. DeepGreen shareholders are happy to sell something that is intrinsically worthless for $7. Heck they would be happy to dump their shares at $2 (and will be doing this in a few weeks I reckon).\n\n# BUT BUT CEO CONFIRMED 2.7 MILLION FLOAT REEEE\n\nNo he fucking didn't. Watch the interview for yourself and don't just take someone's word for it. He was very very careful to say float is low (subjective) and not confirm the 2.7 million figure that reddit is pushing. Also this is a fraudulent Canadian underwated mining company with a fraudster CEO who wore a fucking **T-Shirt** to ring the bell of the NYSE last Friday. So the fact that you all didn't take what he said with a grain of salt is hilarious. \n\n# QUESTION EVERYTING (AND GET REAL)\n\nIt seems like every post on WSB now is \"Reeee if we all buy alot of shares price go up.\" Zero sum games are not going to make WSB money in the aggregate. Hive mind behavior opens up WSB to be scammed like they were with $TMC. All it took for DeepGreen and other insiders to dump shares in this company worth $0 was a fake float number posted several times on WSB . The kicker is that the pump was most likely coordinated by the company itself. \n\n**To WSB's credit, it seems like most commenters understood the company was fraudulent and were only getting in on this for a squeeze play. However, if you know the company is fraudulent, maybe next time spend 15-30 minutes confirming if the 'float' supporting the squeeze play is actually accurate (SPOILER: IT WASN'T).**\n\nPositions:\n\n50 Oct 15 $5 PUT @ 22 cents\n\n20 Nov 19 $5 PUT @ 60 cents","743":"Simon Property Group (SPG) Alright you retail obsessed retards it's time to throw away your pull ups and get a pair of whitey tighties because it's time we learn to whipe all by ourselves and invest in a stock that does all the work behind the scenes.\n\nSimon Property Group owns mall properties and made a sexy comeback after covid so I'm here to give you some seriously juicy information about the stocks future here in the next coming months.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne thing I've noticed is the sentiment around malls is that they have down syndrome and no one goes to them anymore.\n\nYou don't know what you have until it's gone.\n\nThanks to COVID everyone realized the mall is actually fun place to go hand out in air conditioning and shop at a Gamestop with a bubble tea.\n\nThe mall has been packed.\n\nI am a small business owner, I own a ride and a business in a mall that is owned by SPG.

Read and you might learn something.** \n\n**Some intro:** I model how market making options moves underlying stocks. This has led to some cool predictions like a certain GameStore on a certain week in January doing some unusual things. Seriously go check my stuff out. Options move the underlying in a very quantifiable manner. Additionally examining the OI gives insights into market sentiment and price expectations. \n\n**Some requisite information and assumptions before getting started.**\n\nOptions are extremely volatile. That's why we're all here but Market Makers follow rules about hedging risks and for good reason. Near all options liquidity is provided by these firms which write the contracts and make money scalping the Bid\/Ask (literally making the market). MM's usually have both ends of a trade, i.e short both calls and puts, which balances out but the net difference results in a directional position. This has to be hedged for multiple reasons not limited to 1. going bankrupt and 2.  betting against clients (this is serious.) They make their money from scalping the B\/A and IV crush. Options are priced that if \u0394 neutral, the MM makes money when IV decreases and loses if it increases. \n\nThat brings us to Delta (\u0394). **\u0394 is the rate of change with respect to spot price (+\/- $1)**. Now that doesn't mean anything but think about \u0394 as the % chance an option expires itm (implied moneyness). This is also the directional risk for a MM who wrote the contract. Gamma \u0393 is the rate of change of \u0394 for +\/- $1 on the underlying. \u0393 is also hedged on MM books. This is done by trading shares and contracts of the underlying which influences price discovery resistance levels. \n\nTo model this we make a few assumptions:\n\n* All contracts are being hedged directionally neutral (This isn't true but is an acceptable assumption to yield a working model)\n* The directional risk of a call and put on the same strike counteract\n* Enough of the boring stuff\n\nThis will be less in depth and more broad in scope than my previous work. More of an overview for the week. A few of these tickers (the SPACS) were requests and not my own positions. Also ignore the \"Hybrid Factor %\". I'm trying something new to  measure signal.

Greetings to the most intelligent people on the planet!\n\nI've been playing with GME and the other charts recently, and it all accumulated into a massive piece of delicious TA,  which I didn't really plan to post to WSB originally - because I felt like some of the honorable WSB residents might be a little tired from that particular stonk. However, after seening [this](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/pppfro\/tmc_spotted_the_cock_and_balls_upside_down_head\/) and [this](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/pph9f0\/as_you_can_see_tmc_is_forming_a_classic_nut_sack\/) beautiful examples of intellectual superiority, I just couldn't resist sharing my hard work with you, dear WSB!(If you, dear reader, are the one who is fed up with GME, then I would recommend you stop reading now and follow the two links above to appreciate HQ TA on other stonks).\n\nFor those, who stayed - enjoy the read!\n\nIt all started from my \u201cL'Oreal shampoo commercial\u201d-like hair bet post, where, in its third chapter, I was theorizing about GME's negative beta (particularly in light of the late January events, when the buy button was disabled) and the current general market setup - how it might influence subsequent GME moves. So, I decided to dive deeper into those correlations and deviations between the price movements of GME and other major assets, using January sneeze as the starting point. This led me to a fascinating, tits-jacking discovery that points at the upcoming inevitable volatile price action!\n\nBuckle up for the TA journey of your life, let\u2019s ~~dive~~ fly in!\n\nOh, almost forgot to quote Jack Black:\n\n>\u201cThis is not the financial advice, no.  \n>  \n>This is just a tribute.  \n>  \n>Couldn't remember becoming a financial advisor, no.  \n>  \n>This is a tribute, oh, to the greatest stonk in the world, alright!\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst things first, it\u2019s a good idea therefore to revisit **late Jan events**, which in my opinion was the moment of revelation and a preview of inevitable storm, when:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# I. The North Remembers:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[GME v VIX v SP, 30 min chart](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/yu1zzckpa2o71.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e10bd82e172e82ea16a68da5c9c4a9c3e07f70ff)\n\n* GME shares added more than 500% in less than two days, showing off its negative beta in all glory,\n* making VIX volatility index explode more than 60% in a single day,\n* and injuring SP badly (sharp decline of about 4% in 21 hours).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt this point, the thesis should sound something like GME\ud83c\udd99VIX\ud83c\udd99=SP\ud83c\udd98, and vice versa. It will be developed further in the next chapters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, quoting my bet post here:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Pepperidge apes should remember that during one of the Gamestop congressional hearings Vlad 'the Stock Implaler' Tenev mentioned something about late January events falling into five-sigma category, which scientifically speaking corresponds to a p-value, or probability, of 3x10-7, or about 1 in 3.5 million. He also used such a hackneyed expression as a 'black swan' event.  \n>  \n>...  \n>  \n>Categorizing January craze as five sigma is debatable to say the least, because Gamestop shares started to skyrocket and multiply in price long before late January, and it doesn't take a lot of wrinkles to understand that the volatility should likely increase further, requiring additional collateral and somewhat decent risk management. However, I'm not going to discuss Vlad's choice of sacrificing Robbinhood users (disabling buy button) in order to protect the solvency of Robbinhood customers (Citadel and co), because that has been done enough times already, and the North remembers. Rather, Robbinhood example and Vlad's interpretation are provided here as a vivid illustration of the fact which we all feel deep inside: there is just too much risk in the market, it is being too much fucking over-leveraged so that even a fucking retail stock broker may easily get margin-called in a matter of hours. It is especially hilarious, considering the fact that unsophisticated actions of buying and holding a particular stock is enough to fuck the system, making the entire house of cards fall apart. The problem is that when you dive deeper, 2008 seem to be a blessing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFurthermore, I should recommend  you reading u\/peruvian_bull Endgame series, and\/or u\/Criand the Bigger Short in order to develop the understanding of the fundamental processes taking place under the hood of the financial markets. To sum up the core idea: the financial system is over-levereged, way more than it was in 2008, and coupled with the industry poor risk assessment standards, it is heading to the next, coming soon, financial crisis. And, in my opinion, what you can see on the charts above, was a sneak peak of the house of cards collapsing. Disabling the buy button was the only option for the big moni guys to stop (or rather to postpone) the system failing miserably. By bringing this dirty trick into play they were able to ~~buy~~ steal some time, which was necessary for deploying emergency measures and urgent market mechanisms (such as new DTCC\/NSCC rules) - which, in turn, are aimed at mitigating the inevitable financial hail**shit**storm, ready to hit the fans.\n\nThere is a plenty of outstanding fundamentals DD on that topic (start from clicking profiles in the paragraph above). As for me, I am the TA type of a wrincle-brained ape, so...\n\nLet me speak from my ~~heart~~ charts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# II. Negative beta more beautiful than Catherine Zeta\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's start from something that you must have heard about many times, but did you really dive into GME exceptional beta? So, what's that thing and why is it so negative? For the sake of saving my and your time, let me quote the almighty Inve**stop**edia:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>In investing, beta does not refer to fraternities, product testing, or old videocassettes. Beta is a measurement of market risk or volatility. That is, it indicates how much the price of a stock tends to fluctuate up and down compared to other stocks.  \n>  \n>The value of any stock index, such as the Standard & Poor's 500 Index, moves up and down constantly. At the end of the trading day, we conclude that \"the markets\" were up or down. An investor considering buying a particular stock may want to know whether that stock moves up and down just as sharply as stocks in general. It may be inclined to hold its value on a bad day or get stuck in a rut when most stocks are rising; whereas the beta is the number that measures a stock's volatility, the degree to which its price fluctuates in relation to the overall stock market. In other words, it gives a sense of the stock's risk compared to that of the greater market's.  \n>  \n>Beta is used also to compare a stock's market risk to that of other stocks. Analysts use the Greek letter '\u00df' to represent beta.Beta is calculated using regression analysis. A beta of 1 indicates that the security's price tends to move with the market. A beta greater than 1 indicates that the security's price tends to be more volatile than the market. A beta of less than 1 means it tends to be less volatile than the market.  \n>  \n>**Negative beta**: A beta less than 0, which would indicate an inverse relation to the market, is possible but highly unlikely.\n\nEssentially, negative beta asset is an asset that tends to move in the opposite direction from the general market. Famous precious metal is one of the good examples: gold and gold stocks have negative betas because they tend to do better when the stock market declines. That is exactly the reason why investors cherish this asset in the turbulent time of recessions, market crashes and corrections, or general uncertainty and volatility - historically gold tends to perform well during such periods, providing the 'safe heaven' to market participants and acting as a hedge. Noice, but this turbulent time we have something special on the horizon.\n\n\\*\\*Le wild negative beta unicorn appears\\*\\*\n\n[Captain GME to gold](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/rpv734w9c2o71.png?width=471&format=png&auto=webp&s=56080fa590e5ecb6f65ad1a72329cd4d12569014)\n\nMany of you must have seen -\u00df posts, but math and numbers are for geniuses, retards only understand crayons and visuals, so...\n\nLadies and gentleapes, with the great pleasure I present you the new negative beta king:\n\n[GME v SP, daily chart](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/iwtaoohhc2o71.jpg?width=2039&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=67b2824b31bf155c6f7d5f992c5141f67a82cdfb)\n\nWhat you see on the chart above is a vivid illustration of GME's negative beta behavior, which commenced during\/after the January sneeze. As for SP, the stable uptrend with the minor corrections is evident, while the asset is achieving ATHs on a regular basis. Looking at the GME now and connecting its highs with the median line, we may observe the opposite trend, as the line is descending. All in all, there is a big-ass convergence manifesting between the two assets, which most probably will result in the increased volatility and the explosive GME breakout \/ trend reversal for SP. Who will blink first?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[GME v SP daily chart + Tower of Pisa](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/3fiwmwwqc2o71.jpg?width=2033&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=63ecddcaa4651b946a4df8541409c8d8e547d435)\n\nNext, take a look at this chart. Don't worry about GME's Pisa offset here, as it is insignificant for the point I'm making (and I had some struggles overlaying the charts in this case). If the previous chart indicates a longer term negative correlation, the one above is like a zoom in: there is an obvious series of divergences and convergences highlighted yellow and blue respectively, which illustrate negative beta again, but on a smaller scale and with local trends. As you can see, as soon a GME bullrun commences and accelerates, SP dips, and vice versa. I hope, that the examples provided are persuasive, and that they helped you to reach the same conclusion as I did, namely: sstonk goes up when stonks go down, while when stonks go up, GME is suppressed = GME\ud83c\udd99SP\ud83c\udd98. Should that correlation continue manifesting itself (which I'm pretty damn confident it will), the exciting times are on the way.\n\nOk, so \ud83c\udd99\ud83c\udd98 is a simple concept, but why is it important, you may ask.\n\nWell, that's why:\n\n[SP, daily chart ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/6b41eaewc2o71.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d9ae4bdc7758ecdbc84425e6ea567e1d4243f9e1)\n\nSP has been forming a powerful bearish technical formation called the rising wedge, through the past year and a half. Currently it is narrowing down, and the point of breakout is not far away - typically it is to the downside for such a technical setup. Add GME with its negative beta to this equation - if you know, you know.\n\n[SP 4H chart, I called it \u2018Head of Penis\u2019 formation ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/sbs9va8od2o71.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ce9b57e1a6fa2020ac1c91218ad5d462ceda5d07)\n\nBut wait, there\u2019s more!\n\n[SP, monthly chart ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/1goqfoa2e2o71.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e3eefcd4720f38907877a2791ea642c3955122b5)\n\nIn one of my TA longwrites, the Big Short 2.0, I identified a beautiful, long term, juicy Elliott 1-2-3-4-5 impulse wave structure on SP, take a look! The investors are currently riding the top of the fifth wave, which is usually the most fun, euphoric and crazily risky. Everything in the nature works in cycles, and all the things that go up, must go down eventually! Considering the current bullrun being one of the (if not THE) most powerful and longest bullruns in history, you can imagine how nasty the retrace may look this time. Especially, when you take into account the fact that current financial markets are filled with shitty synthetic derivatives, excessive leverage of a bad quality, unthinkable level of risk, and... plain fucking crime. The financial world is craving for the correction (like Sahara for rainfall) and a proper bear market, as the deleveraging will make it healthier, and maybe, just maybe, it will bring price discovery back to life from the grave where it has been rolling for I don\u2019t know how long.\n\nMan, I wish there was a safe heaven asset that would protect me from the upcoming financial typhoon, the price of which would move the opposite way from the overdue nasty correction on all financial markets, which have been enjoying the most powerful bullrun in history for more than ten fucking years...

Chew it Over with VIX\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNext, let\u2019s talk about Volatility Index - what I noticed recently, is that VIX is often being neglected in the TA discussions, and in general also, so it\u2019s a good idea to show it some love. Especially since GME and VIX correlate to a considerable fucking extent, but later on that.\n\nTo begin with,\n\n[VIX, monthly chart ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/1fcd3vlge2o71.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=78c23f899b3d623552b4b402c0abe74266108223)\n\nThe chart above is provided for the visual explanation of how this instrument behaves. In short, markeds kaboom TWIX wroom wroom. In essence, the Cboe Volatility Index is a market sentiment tracking index that represents the market participants expectations for volatility over the coming 30 days. Volatility, or the severity of price fluctuations, is usually helpful to gauge market sentiment, particularly the degree of fear and uncertainty spreading on the financial markets. Investors use VIX to measure the level of risk, fear, or stress in the market when making investment decisions. It is an important index in the world of finance because it provides a quantifiable measure of market risk and investors' sentiments.\n\nAnd who would have guessed, throughout the year VIX spikes have been accompanying almost every single GME major run, but for one:\n\n[GME v VIX, daily log chart](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ksd03p5pe2o71.jpg?width=1969&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=835dee5dd6c8b5367088857995e01a720f41f13a)\n\nJust one major outlier to that tandem is late November 2020 run. Speaking of outliers, also VIX middle of June 2021 spike seems to stand out from the crowd, as there is no relevant proportionate positive price action on the GME side. Outside of those two occasions, the correlational behaviour of these two instruments is evident. Moreover, VIX and GME runs correlate to the extent that their peaks match time-wise in several run ups. Furthermore, take a look at how starting 2021 four out of five major VIX spikes correspond with the occasions when GME\u2019s price action was trialling $230-ish level (margin call level, it seems) - the price territory, around which my concept of the \u2018Purple Haze\u2019 resistance (\u201cbreak to initiate the squeeze\u201d) is established, refer to the short squeezes comparisons post to explore the concept. The correlational behaviour described above, to my understanding, points at two big conclusions: the first and the most obvious one, is GME\ud83c\udd99VIX\ud83c\udd99; secondly, it seems that GME is currently the biggest risk for the market! - too much synchronicity is present between the two, for this to be a mere coincidence. Remember, VIX represents volatility, fear and stress - wut feelin Kenny?\n\nOh, and did I mention?\n\n[VIX, daily chart ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/q0hb68xue2o71.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2bcfaadcd5304e1c57307f4b954759dd402f33f8)\n\nDuring the year and a half, the instrument\u2019s price action has been consolidating into a beautiful bullish formation, called the descending wedge - which is exactly the opposite of what SP is consolidating into. VIX descending wedge + SP rising wedge + GME\ud83c\udd99VIX\ud83c\udd99SP\ud83c\udd98, quick math, and\n\n[We get an ape\u2019s best friend, Gator the Bubbles Deflator \\(the Greater\\).](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/2fzj2pdye2o71.jpg?width=2032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ecbdb4676a65c16dee75b9d3613fde91cecf7335)\n\nIf you know, you know.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# IV.

I hope that the discussion above helped you to build the solid understanding of what's happening on broader financial markets and how those correlations and tendencies are affecting GME price action, and will probably add the fuel to the rocket in the upcoming major GME moves. Now, the focus of the discussion is back on the GME current TA status quo! (yeah, finally!)

As you can see, during the year, each time the price action approached the lower support, a sharp re-bounce followed - August and September confirmed the price line as THE most important support, manifesting the steadfast buying pressure. That pressure is currently confronting the most important resistance for GME in 2021 (magenta line). The battle will be legendary! (Hint: remember the current market setups discussed in II, and III, and the correlations? Based solely on that, what do you think the GME breakout will look like?)\n\nBut wait, there's more!

Good or bad idea? I'd honestly like some real feedback from some of you degenerates here. I am no expert trader and I am still fairly new to the options game. I have got lucky day trading on a few SPY puts\/calls over the last couple months, but my losses outweigh my gains. My best option day trade was buying one GME weekly call a couple weeks ago right when it started to go parabolic. Turned $108 into $670 in an hour.

Everything here is not financial advice. I just want to know if someone can do it better.\n\n**Prediction:**\n\nPersonally, I'm banking on a quick crash of 30%-40% of the overall market followed by a lengthy recovery time.\n\nWith the public consciousness being aware of the rapid inflation, the Great Resignation, the ending of the eviction moratorium, rising tensions within and out of the country, scrambled supply lines accompanied with mass shortages, and blah-blah-blah, I think a lot of investors have their fingers hovering over the sell button. This, along with the addition of short sellers ready to dogpile on the beginning of a downward trend, should result in a sharp decline in several securities' prices. However, unlike the Covid-19 crash, I do not believe we'll experience a quick bull rally after the market bottoms out.\n\nThe flash crash of 2020 was driven by the fear of an unknown virus and the suspicion of an overdue recession, but once heavy government intervention was in place, investors had their confidence restored. This time around, the U.S. is facing a likely default on it's debt and dealing with almost irreparable internal economic problems, and the general confidence in our institutions has greatly withered since then. I think America's government is very limited with how it can intervene and I have trouble seeing the market whales and many retail traders easily jumping right back in after any announcement has been made; leading to a prolonged stagnation.\n\nNow, I am certainly not a professional in market predictions or knowing what the hell the powers that be can do alter markets. I'm just someone who likes trading and has been keeping up with the news. You should take this prediction with a FISTFUL of salt.\n\n**My Plan:**\n\nSadly, my broker restricts much of what I can do (no naked options, no covered puts, no margin account for options, etc.), which restricts how much I can grow my account. Nevertheless, I worked a way around these rules and plan for a FAT gain.\n\nWith that said, I want to combine my money with borrowed cash from friends\/family (people who are outside the market) and a personal loan, plus whatever my brokerage will give me in my margin account. Estimated leverage should be roughly x3.5. After gathering the capital, I will short the ever-loving shit out of SPXL (a 3x leverage ETF of the SP500) and use the new founded cash along with some of the account's original capital to buy ATM puts. Next, using a majority of the remaining capital, I'll buy shares of SPXS (a 3x leverage inverse ETF of the SP500) and sell deep OTM calls because of the increased volatility due to panic selling. What's left of the account will be spent on ATM calls of SPXS.\n\nI chose SPXL and SPXS for the fact they follow the very stable and predictable SP500, but with more bang for their buck. I know WSB isn't known for it's safer gambles, but with the increased risk of using so much borrowed money and a falling market, I needed something to sound somewhat safe and reasonable to place the bet.\n\nIf this portion of the plan fails, all I have to simply do is consolidate all my debt and then become Wendy's personal bitch boy for the better portion of my life, reflecting on where I went wrong as I shovel grease into the mouths of meatbags. If this portion of the plan succeeds, then after paying back the principle and one to two month's worth of interest (how long I think the decline will last), I should obtain a return of at least x10.\n\n***NOTE:*** *i failed math class. number may vary.*\n\nNext up is the stagnation period of the crash. I will be taking some of the gains out of the brokerage account lock in my win. The rest will be scaled into discounted stocks (likely blue chips with decent dividend yields and leveraged ETFs). On top of scaling in, selling iron condors would also be considered. If it turns out that the economy will undergo another v-shaped recovery like last time, I'll kiss goodbye to most of my winnings, but still make it out with a profit.\n\n**Questions:**\n\nAnyone got a better alternative for taking advantage of the market crash without going full retard and yoloing your mortgage in deep OTM Tesla calls expiring in six minutes? Am I overlooking an opportunity or flaw in my plan? Did you even bother reading all of the post? Is everyone still holding onto GME?\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\nI'm certainly not a doomer (or god forbid, a gay bear), but I do recognize crashes do happen and I just want to utilize extreme leverage to make a hefty gain after it's all said and done. But I do struggle to make five bucks on a ten thousand dollar account, so what the fuck do I know.","750":"BlackBerry is part of the 3 most shorted stocks. AMC, GME, and BB will boom all together.

Same time, Blackberry is also becoming a major cybersecurity company. **They announced \"Blackberry Delivers Secure Modern Authentication for Microsoft 365.\"**  [BB 10.48 -0.25 -2.38% : BlackBerry Limited - Yahoo Finance](https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/blackberry-delivers-secure-modern-authentication-120000568.html)\n\nThe same article states \" BlackBerry (NYSE: BB; TSX: BB) provides intelligent security software and services to enterprises and governments around the world. The company secures more than 500M endpoints including over 195M vehicles.\" They are becoming a huge cybersecurity and this stock is great in long term as well. \n\n [3 Monthly Chart Most-Shorted Stocks to Buy Today | InvestorPlace](https:\/\/investorplace.com\/2021\/08\/3-monthly-chart-most-shorted-stocks-to-buy\/) \\- Here is the article about the three most shorted stocks.

Not only is this kind of thing **rare to see**, but the significance of it with GME fits the theory that the stock is outrageously short.\n\n# So, why is this important?\n\nThere is an expected taper to happen from the Federal Reserve soon.  Although specifics weren't mentioned, it has been rumored a 1-2% taper will happen which, should this happen, the markets will drop significantly.  If the taper is truly 1-2% without accounting for panic selling, the likely drop could be anywhere between 4-6% (overall).  This with the eventual contraction of monetary policy (which is much closer to us than we think) should cause the overall market to drop significantly as well.\n\nAssuming things play out like this, GME's negative beta at -2.0 should mean it would increase at the rate the overall market drops and those short on GME will likely be squeezed out which, as a result, will force **massive levels of liquidation** on other securities to cover their short positions (naked as well) furthering negative movement for the overall market.\n\n# GME's Beta vs Normal Stocks\n\nBeta is a pretty accurate tool and for most stocks unafflicted by this form of manipulation, the relationship between the overall market's movement and the unafflicted stock's movement is crystal clear.  Not only is a negative beta rare to see, but **it's inconsistency with the overall market is equally rare too**.  In essence, it shows manipulation is happening because there are bouts where GME actually moves with the market despite having a negative beta.  I'm not talking about small dips or gains eithers, I'm talking about the overall picture, where we've seen SPY hit 450 and GME has been all over the place, yet, it's negative beta stands.\n\nI don't have an immediate answer for this, but what we do know is that ETF's play a large role with those shorting meme stocks.  Same with options and thus, when we see GME move inconsistent with it's beta, what we're actually seeing is manipulation take place.\n\nTLDR\n\n* GME has a negative beta which suggests that the stock moves opposite of the overall market.\n* The Feds' taper and eventual contraction of monetary policy will cause the markets to drop significantly, which will likely the catalyst for shorts to be squeezed out.\n* GME has a negative beta because of short positions taken on it.  Whenever shorts become squeezed out of their positions, massive levels of liquidation on other securities will happen to cover their short position which, as a result, should drop the overall market.\n* The rate of GME's increase will likely be the rate of decrease for the overall market.\n* GME's beta is not only extremely rare to see, but the extreme inconsistencies of it's movement is equally rare.  This alone shows that manipulation is taking place.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSources\n\n[https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/b\/beta.asp](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/b\/beta.asp)\n\n[https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/business\/feds-powell-weighs-delta-risk-gives-no-signal-start-bond-buying-taper-2021-08-27\/](https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/business\/feds-powell-weighs-delta-risk-gives-no-signal-start-bond-buying-taper-2021-08-27\/)\n\n[https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/quote\/GME?p=GME&.tsrc=fin-srch](https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/quote\/GME?p=GME&.tsrc=fin-srch)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBelow are two examples of when GME's beta reflects accurate movement.

Just a note to keep in mind.\n\n---------------------------------\n\nHere it is, I got lucky.  I took a few loans in different ways to daytrade stocks:\n\n- $30k\n- $15k\n- $8k from my girlfriend\n- $5k from credit cards\n- some savings from my regular job\n\nThe reason I took so many loans is that I was constantly making little money and losing (the loans were not taken all at once). At one point, I decided to put together as much money as possible and went all in on GameStop after the first squeeze.\n\nWhen GameStop hit $340 the second time, I sold it all literally 5 minutes before it dipped, and made $65k.\n\nSince that moment, I've been trading with $50k+ and it's been really easy to make money, so I decided to quit my job. After quitting, I got my hand into $25k that they had to pay me as severance.\n\nBottom line: I extinguished all my loans BUT $27k I owe the bank, and right now I'm trading with $65k. I figured that, considering taxes, I have to make $1500 monthly to break even (monthly expenses + loan rate). If I pay off the bank, that amount is reduced to $700 monthly expenses.\n\nHowever, if I pay off the bank, my trading power will be reduced to $35k, which is insufficient, in my experience, to make money just trading stocks. So what do I do? Keep trading until those $65k become, lets say, $100k, and then pay off the bank? Or just extinguish debt and go back to trade with under $50k?\n\nThanks!\n\n**EDIT 2:** some people are doubting the authenticity of this post when I say I got a severance package after quitting. Severance package here is like 401k on the US. In some European countries, you don't get a choice and some money is taken from your salary each month and deposited as \"severance package\" by the company. When you switch jobs or quit, that money is given to you. If you held a job for 10 years, you get a really nice exit bonus.\n\n**EDIT 3:** I live in **Western Europe**, just not in a big city like London on Paris, but a smaller city.

That failed worse than my last date, oh so many years ago. Then someone here claimed that the thin green uptrend line I've got on there was supposed to hold. That failboat sailed to a galaxy far, far away. But the #2b breakout line did, at last, managed to hold. And then we got a breakout of that nasty red downtrend this week and now we're trying, once more to breakout of the #3 line.\n\nSo, does GME have it in itself to enter hyperspace? Well, from a DD perspective earnings are coming up and that is probably going to spell doom or boom for the ticker. The company is in the midst of a turnaround, so it at least has a good story going for it (unlike anything Disney owns).\n\nFrom a TA perspective... well, to be honest, TA is just there so you can feel better or worse about your decision. It can't really predict all that much, except for after the fact. But it can give traders some piece of mind before the fact; a sort of all-clear that many need before jumping in a position. To that extent, getting out from under that downtrend was a big deal. From here, it's all on the shoulders of retail to initiate **Operation Bagholder Rescue**, if it is to happen at all.\n\n**Cbass's Call for GME:** I actually think you ~~retards~~ *brilliant, forward thinking investors* have it in you to break back over $218. Can you bust the $330 double top? I'm not so confident, but I'd be happily proven wrong.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNext up, an empty movie theater for a Disney Star Wars showing, AMC:\n\n[Supreme stupidity, in chart form](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ja0puvoug6k71.png?width=1576&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab226485fe17812dfc4c94cd4d0d661d31d6eb56)\n\nMy previous thesis called for AMC to retrace to the #2a line, $14.54. Whelp, y'all decided to buy up the whole damn company and proceeded to prove me wrong. But in the true form of a TA Jedi Master, I've just *ex post facto* revised my thesis so that I'm still correct: Now I'm calling the May-June launch a Double-Event, so powerful it impregnated half the girls in Bangkok, because *reasons*. Accordingly, the settling at the #2b line is right in line with my \"original\" thesis. This is how it's done, young padawan.\n\nHaving found that support, this week saw AMC also breakout of a downtrend line. I've included a small uptrend channel that I saw on some other guy's AMC TA, and we've dropped back into that. Unlike GME, there is not a significant resistance line above the current position, which is nice.\n\nFrom a DD perspective, there is not much great to say about this company and \"fundamentals\" are doing nothing but holding the ticker back. Maybe if Disney hadn't fucked up Star Wars, there'd be some major films to fill the seats right now. Furthermore, management's penchant for stock sales and the possibility of more to come if you idiots actually moon this thing again *is not helping*.\n\n**Cbass's Call for AMC:** Skies look pretty clear to me; up is the direction. I wouldn't count on that channel lasting for too long, though. On the other hand, if you wunderkinds *can't* get this thing to moon, gravity will ruin your day, week, month, year, and for some of you extra special ones: *your entire financial future*.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNext, a company somehow survived irrelevancy, BB:\n\n[Extra \\\\\"special\\\\\" line drawing skills here](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/o39cqkfcj6k71.png?width=1576&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a723faac2fda7a0dfffd6e5248d5665bac3f7b8)\n\nJust like GME, BB failed to settle at the previous breakout line (#3), and instead decided you fuckers needed the ***executive tour*** of the S&M dungeon before finally settling around $9.50. BB has since broken out of *two* down trend lines! That means it's going to moon twice as hard, bro! You can readjust line #3 so it's at $11.56 or so, and then it looks like this past week's action tested and failed that line, just like was the case for GME. Indeed, from a chart-perspective GME and BB are the most closely aligned (with BBBY being a somewhat retarded cousin that ~~I've~~ *everyone has* given up talking about).\n\nFrom the DD perspective, apparently BB has some magic AI shit going for it and it's related to security and cars and shit. Whatever, just sounds like Cathie Woodisms to me, but such platitudes are the nectar of the masses and if that gets 'em to buy, who fuckin' cares.\n\nOn the TA side, this is in the same boat as GME. You've got to at least break over $11.50 to stand a chance. Over that, the skies are clear for a run into the twenties and that'll be enough for the gamblers to start hurling YOLO's at it once more.\n\n**Cbass's Call on BB**: Up if GME goes up. Sideways or down otherwise. This one's not going to move independent of Big Daddy. It's also not going to move as hard because of the large free float.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd finally, the little brother that your mom made to take to the party and is now embarrassing you in front of the hot chicks, CLOV:\n\n[No, CLOV, you were supposed to be the Chosen One. Not ruin my portfolio!](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/45d9m8f9m6k71.png?width=1576&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a3985c252a10b333677c7749da916ebf1b6f171)\n\nNow, I know some of you are thinking: CLOV? What the fuck? CLOV doesn't belong on this list. It belongs on the list with WISH, WKHS and all that other garbage. And you'd be right to think that. But I still own CLOV, and it is ***technically*** not dead. It's just ***mostly dead***, and if you've seen the Princess Bride, you know that mostly dead has a cure.... unlike my stupidity. In addition, CLOV has been hovering near the top of the sentiment lists for some time, so there's that.\n\nLike the others above, CLOV has broken out of a downtrend, or possibly two (I was generous with that second, orange line). However, unlike BB or GME, CLOV is nowhere near its prior breakout level. Indeed, the $9 mark is proving to be an impenetrable barrier. We might actually need a Zombie Dragon to take that fucker down. On the good side of the TA, the \\~$8 line is proving to be the actual bottom.\n\nOn the DD side, CLOV had its earnings and they were wholly unimpressive. The clovtards dug deep to find the nuggets of good, but the overall market said, \"Yeah, nah bitch,\" and slapped it back down with an extra helping of pimp-hand.\n\n**Cbass's Call for CLOV:** It exists to fuck up my yearly P\/L, but if GME and AMC can take off, they'll carry CLOV and its whole clown army up with them. Problem is, there's no imminent breakout overhead. We've got to go up a ways before any true breakout can be attempted. Which means unless we get a truly epic launch of the whole Meme Space Force, CLOV has the potential to get shot down before ever getting back up to the high teens, let alone the twenties.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Part 2. The Voice of Alex Jones**\n\nIt's conspiracy theory time! Yayy!\n\nSo the voice of Alex Jones came to me in a dream the other night and it got me wondering: Is this whole endeavor an elaborate trap to ensnare idiot retail traders into terrible options that are certain to expire worthless? Let's look at the evidence.\n\nFirst, we didn't get any breakouts until after the 8\/20 expiry. Together with the 7\/16 expiry, this represented (I believe) a ***massive*** chunk of options. I saw this regarding CLOV, and I suspect it is a similar story for GME, AMC and BB, and a whole host of other 'meme stocks.'\n\nSecond, I'm *quite sure* at this point that Big Money is behind the Jedi Options Wizardry that causes these massive spikes. Originally, I thought that this was just a Big Money vs. Big Money game and we were naught but pawns in their schemes.\n\nNow... I'm beginning to think ~~aliens~~ ***the House*** is in on it. Basically, they are going to let\/help the meme stock launches in order to rope a bunch of idiots into buying shitty options. Particularly, those who buy them on the downslope of the spikes, hoping for a quick rebound. Those options are going to be easy to kill and the House can clean up.\n\nBut they'll never get the chance if the whole meme stock \"movement\" dies a slow death. It is only by hanging a line out, enticing the morons with dreams of easy money and fast cars and loose women that they can get y'all to bite in large enough numbers. Basically, the sight of those big green dildos is impossible to resist and FOMO takes over and you dipshits buy options that are all but DoA.\n\n**So, is this all just a trap?** Answer: **yes**, no matter which way you look at it.\n\nEven disregarding my tinfoil hat ramblings, this past week's action has the smell of a classic bull-trap.\n\n**But does it actually matter?** Answer: **no**. You can still make money, and a fuck load of it, even if my tinfoil hat theory is right. *Especially* if it's right, in fact.\n\n[We're gonna last a lot longer against those hedge funds than we will against that Citadel!](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/s1xs80j3y6k71.jpg?width=2181&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=80ffff00b19d3dea26c921fe6337e039c10b8a8e)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Part 3. A New Hope**\n\nI've been sensing a turning of opinion in the short time I've been here with you all. When I first came upon this wonderful community of simpletons, DD posts about new companies were most often met with \"You had me at retard\" and \"I'm all in.\"\n\nNow it seems people are too scared to post high quality DD's because the immediate response is \"Fuck your pump & dump and your mom while we're at it!\" Were there pump and dumps? Too many to count. Did I fall for one? Probably.\n\nWhile some OGs are breathing a sigh of relief at this relative return to \"normality,\" and I can't blame them, I still feel a certain something has been lost. That magic feeling, that tingling in the ballsack that whispered to you, \"*this is stupid, but it might actually work anyway*.\" This week, for one glorious moment, I felt that again and damn did it feel good.\n\nSure we bagholders are a pitiable bunch. That cannot be denied, even if we keep it close to the chest, even, I think, for those most ardent cult members. Still, there is something to be said of keeping hope alive, of holding on to the belief that broken and battered simpletons left atop seemingly insurmountable peaks on charts awash in red ***can still be saved***.\n\nSo as another week comes upon us, I implore you to not lose hope, for it is *literally all we have left*. Hear that John Williams score rise in the ether about you, and know this: It's not over until we blow up ~~the Death Star~~ *our accounts*! (^(Or Disney buys us))\n\n[Que the Journey, ladies and gentlemen.](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/g8isr2tq07k71.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c2dff374b682ca9cc4fef8539d121905c1401284)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\\*Rich can mean a lot of things, such as: rich in spirit, rich in experience, or rich in delusions of grandeur.**\n\nPositions or ban, a.k.a., the *Portfolio of Destiny*:\n\n[I've got 'em on the ropes, boys!](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/hk65a8ow17k71.jpg?width=1675&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=89bab8c2e7df13eec9c10c339c76940983978f34)\n\nEdits for spelling and grammar, per usual.\n\nEdit: I just now realized, a day later, that I used the wrong roman numeral in the title... fml.","765":"AMC and GME Prediction's, and Some of todays trades I took GME yesterday perditions and what i said.

The short, the squeeze, and the ugly manipulation\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOk, so a couple(ish) of moths ago I handcrafted that TA thesis (on which the beard bet is based) for GME price action and its potential move to lower thousands as the short squeeze progresses:\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/5sldutzq33j71.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=361a46ce8b8d54a87703e2409bc1896e50c9ae15\n\nThe thesis above was not a generic 'you are here' type of posts you got used to seeing occasionally here and there through the last half a year. Rather, it was a fair attempt to critically assess the stonk's technical setup through the prism of the two most famous SS historical examples:\n\n[VW](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/h7b6sm9t43j71.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a1da13436e92326b0ec63688d81f39f17574acb8)\n\n[and TSLA](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/iz041qtv43j71.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1174f413961be8903377068f5e41ce538f115f23)\n\n[The OC post and analysis](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/nc6qi3\/lets_revive_the_buried_wsb_culture_gme_to\/) (which is still worth your reading, especially if you want to grasp this chapter of the post in greater detail) took me a lot of effort to produce, and I am still proud to have done this work, distilling the essential components of a short squeeze structure, and creating at least some sort of a framework to apply in cases like the current one. However, GME price during the summer did not follow the pattern, and particularly its most anticipated triangular 'Squieezluminati Confirmed' stage.\n\n[by Pink Floyd is one of my favourite songs](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ncwwuqz253j71.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=188c089eeef5aeb0308614caba55c538e84ccbe1)\n\nDoes it render the whole thing void? Well, that's what I've been thinking in August while morally preparing myself for the beard apostasy. But something didn't quiet fit, and I kept digging. Just to stumble upon this:\n\n[AMCSS, daily chart](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/58sg96eg53j71.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5b9d97cdc553fe4645cd76576d26c8b0c73122ae)\n\nLooks familiar, doesn't it? Ladies and apemen, with a great pleasure I present you AMCSS, the timing of which is really similar to what I was betting my beard on in relation to GME. What happened to AMC during the summer actually proves almost every single point from my SS thesis. Firstly, the 'Purple Haze' level ($14.38) is the main resistance on the chart, and only when the breakout occurs, the SS unfolds. Secondly, 'Squeezy Grail' (the cup shaped consolidation) and the 'Runway' (rectangle) phases precede the squeeze impulse - that's where the buying pressure accumulates, to the point when it can no longer be suppressed. Next, interestingly enough, trend based Fibonacci periods grid allows to predict the peak date (vertical line marked as 1) extremely accurately, if the preliminary trend + the 'Squeezy Grail' phase are used as its core measurement (red dashed line). But wait, there's more! The 'Purple Haze' resistance is in between 1 and 0.786 Fibo levels (horizontal), while the retracement itself measures the amplitude of the SS impulse perfectly - e.g. take a look at how the price action retraces to 0.5 Fibo after the peak, or how the price consolidates in the channel of 0.236-0.382 after that. Well, the thesis fits almost perfectly to AMC - I hope you're now sitting like\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/nltp4a1l53j71.jpg?width=550&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3e9489b7944a802185db6adc69121f72b4e546dc\n\nThere are several minor deviations from the SS frameworks which should be mentioned too, though: the PH breakout occurs during 0.618 Fibo period, rather than 0.382, as it was in historical examples; the triangular phase doesn't really resemble a triangle. Notwithstanding those minor factors, original SS thesis is more than alive with the AMC example.\n\nYou might be thinking now: what defuq is this crazy dude is talking about, where is the video of the beard shaved? Well, I'm providing the AMCSS analysis here in order to prove that my thesis is legitimate, and GME price action had to follow the pattern. GME and AMC are like brothers in arms, with 'similar' fundamentals, and through the major part of 2021 those two have been moving in tandem, strongly following linear correlation principle. The thesis structure (built upon TSLA and VW historical examples) indicates that there is the strong buying pressure accumulating, and in AMC example the lid was opened for a bit to let the steam out; while GME is still being suppressed even further during the current consolidation, and in my opinion - it is done artificially and purposely.\n\nFurthermore, take a look at this:\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/44m2qp2q53j71.png?width=1880&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2c9f3297506328e1c0b4a5bd4f5cfa4105a29e8\n\nWhat you see above is the screenshot from [my other post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/nwub7d\/gme_to_amc_and_bb_last_week_ladies_go_first_gme\/), where I explained that two stonks had extremely similar technical setups: both have long-ass triangular consolidation at the core, which is subsequently broken out to the upside. Next, take a look at MACDs or TSIs from both examples, and particularly at what is highlighted by rectangles - zoom in and see for yourself, the structures are close to being identical. So, the question arises: why if two stocks have very similar fundamental and technical backgrounds, one is allowed to moon a little bit, while the other one is being knocked out each time right before the lift off should occur? The answer if fairly obvious, and it's because some big financial boys want things to go this way. AMC is something they can control, or maybe they even benefit from it\u2019s price fluctuations. While GME is a Pandora box, and they try to keep its lid close for as long as possible, soothed by an illusion of a controllable chaos. And those suckers are ready to use any method to suppress the price, especially \\*\\*insert Aliens Guy meme here\\*\\*: manipulation.\n\nApes from a friendly sub uncovered many such methods, like good old FTDs, married puts, OTC trades, wash sales, darkpools... I'm not going to discuss those things in this post, because there is a plenty of outstanding DD on reddit.

The manipulation is so blatantly obvious that it makes me sick. Manipulating the market is not cheap, and probably costs fuckers on the other side of the trade millions, if not billions every month. Why would there be so much effort and resources put into the war over a \u2018memestonk\u2019? Is it so that they want some random noname reddit retard to lose his precious beard? The actual answer is shocking, and in my opinion it should be sought in two Greek letters, **\u03c3 (sigma)** and **\u03b2 (beta**).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Chapter II. How 1987 and 2008 are reincarnating into 2021\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPepperidge apes should remember that during one of the Gamestop congressional hearings Vlad 'the Stock Implaler' Tenev mentioned something about late January events falling into five-sigma category, which scientifically speaking corresponds to a p-value, or probability, of 3x10-7, or about 1 in 3.5 million. He also used such a hackneyed expression as a 'black swan' event. Quote from a [Bloomberg article](https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/opinion\/articles\/2021-02-19\/gamestop-hearing-robinhood-is-cool-but-is-it-out-of-its-depth):  \n\n\n>A \u201cblack swan\u201d event \u2014 made famous by Nassim Nicholas Taleb in a best seller that parsed the role of randomness in finance and life \u2014 comes as a surprise, has great impact and later becomes rationalized away as easily explained or predicted. *Many things that appear to be black swans, however, aren\u2019t unforeseeable and are merely classified as such to avoid responsibility for not spotting them ahead of time in the first place*. A \u201cfive-sigma event\u201d is a statistical descriptor of something that occurs five standard deviations away from and on either side of the mean in a data set. It describes the odds of something happening, and in five-sigma territory the odds are long.\n\nCategorizing January craze as five sigma is debatable to say the least, because Gamestop shares started to skyrocket and multiply in price long before late January, and it doesn't take a lot of wrinkles to understand that the volatility should likely increase further, requiring additional collateral and somewhat decent risk management. However, I'm not going to discuss Vlad's choice of sacrificing Robbinhood users (disabling buy button) in order to protect the solvency of Robbinhood customers (Citadel and co), because that has been done enough times already, and the North remembers. Rather, Robbinhood example and Vlad's interpretation are provided here as a vivid illustration of the fact which we all feel deep inside: there is just too much risk in the market, it is being too much fucking over-leveraged so that even a fucking retail stock broker may easily get margin-called in a matter of hours. It is especially hilarious, considering the fact that unsophisticated actions of buying and holding a particular stock is enough to fuck the system, making the entire house of cards fall apart. The problem is that when you dive deeper, 2008 seem to be a blessing.\n\nFor example, let's start from the easy difficulty, take a look at this chart:\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/47plfcth63j71.jpg?width=910&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=90c6f9cfa07676ce106f2f111b12a557f09fd8bc\n\nOne of the major indicators of how the leverage is utilized is FINRA's margin statistics from its members (who carry margin accounts for customers), which FINRA publishes every month. There are several points of interest for us on the chart above. The first and the most important one is that margin dept has tripled after previous major bottom in 2009, from about $300 billions to almost $900 bn in 2021. Furthermore, take a look at how MD reaches the peak of $500 bn both in 2000 and 2007, and it's sufficient to send S&P into several years bear market with 50% retrace, as soon as the leveraging trend reverses. Currently, MD is on its way to trilly, the figure has almost doubled compared to 2000 and 2007. Sounds a bit GUHy, doesn't it? Also, looking at the margin debt before the .com bubble, 2007 financial crisis and Covid crash it can be seen that, each time, the margin contraction starts before the crash itself, making MD a leading indicator. And guess what? MD is down 4.3% in July, which is the first major decline in 15 months. Deleveraging is a painful process, but is necessary for markets\u2019 health, and it seem to have already begun.\n\nHowever, this time it is going to be so much fucking worse. To quote a brilliant mind, u\/Criand:  \n\n\n>2008 never finished. It was can-kicked and the same people who caused the crash have still been running rampant doing the same bullshit in the derivatives market as that market continues to be unregulated. They're profiting off of short-term gains at the risk of killing their institutions and potentially the global economy.\n\nI strongly recommend you reading his informative 2008 post in full, because it is a fascinating financial journey, through which you will learn a lot about how fuk the financial system really is right now, largely because of leverage. Imagine if r\/WallStreetBets was a central bank. Fuck, this must be the most spot on metaphor I came up with in my entire life. Actually, it seems now that the entire financial world is one fucking giant WSB right now. And not in the good sense of its reputation.\n\nTo quote another brilliant mind, u\/peruvian_bull, whose series of posts has been peer-reviewed by an economics professor:  \n\n\n>The entire derivatives market is HUGE. The BIS estimated the total notional value of the OTC derivatives market to be $640 Trillion in 2019! And that doesn't even include exchange-listed derivatives like most common option contracts. More sober estimates put it somewhere north of $1 Quadrillion. Numbers of this size are hard to wrap your head around - this is equivalent to a million billion, or a thousand trillion- for reference, the US economy is around $22 Trillion and the world economy is estimated to be $88 Trillion - thus the entire world economy could fit into the notional derivatives market 11x over and STILL not reach it. Every single bank is exposed, either directly or indirectly, to this market. For example, Deutsche Bank ALONE has over $47 Trillion in Notional gross exposure - TWICE the size of the entire US Economy!\n\n[Wow](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/enhgxe0773j71.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6839e329715d3c47d81048d7c21054b9f218b306)\n\n*Intermediate TL;DR: the financial market is sufficiently levered according to its risk tolerance, and we all know what comes after that:*\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/2pb2k9qv63j71.jpg?width=358&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0fe0cfb61c4db4c8c26fc5a464b8f25319b6e59c\n\nThis represents what Buffet called \u201cA Time Bomb\u201d in the market - as long as money flows in, the party continues. Once it stops, the Weapons of Financial Destruction are unleashed. As you may remember, something like that happened in 2008, when predatory lending targeting low-income homebuyers, excessive risk-taking by global financial institutions,\n\n[And when I leverage like x1.5, I GUH straight away, so unfair!](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/xct7amb273j71.png?width=1619&format=png&auto=webp&s=31b3738202cdc6b3cc7de9692d5b60643a906309)\n\nand the burst of the US housing bubble culminated in a perfect shitstorm. MBSs (Mortgage Backed Securities) tied to American real estate, as well as a vast web of linked to those MBSs CDOs, collapsed in value. As a result, financial institutions worldwide suffered severe damage, the GDP contracted sharply, the unemployment rates rose significantly, pushing millions of people into poverty - largely because some greedy bastards who had too much of financial power based on over-abused leverage and close to zero risk management made all the wrong decisions they could.\n\nThanks God, they promised not to do that again!\n\n[The scene is from \u2018Inside Job\u2019 movie, a bright reminder of what\u2019s going to happen again, soon.](https:\/\/reddit.com\/link\/pa03sf\/video\/1rflh5jy33j71\/player)\n\n\\*\\*In Tyler\u2019s voice\\*\\* So that was a fucking lie:\n\n[Sauce: OCC's quarterly report on bank trading and derivaives, Q1 2021](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/f9xgxitt73j71.jpg?width=2224&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3ccec798f35738ffb3435312c556fcd18646e6bd)\n\nThe figures above provide the relatively up-to-date exposure of the the biggest commercial banks towards derivatives. Although, we shouldn\u2019t expect that those numbers allow to calculate somewhat precise leverage ratios, inasmuch as many of these derivative obligations net each other out, rendering the real value of the debt to be a bit more modest (or maybe not, who knows what\u2019s really going on OTC). What is safe to assume, however, is that based on the numbers above, the leverage ratio is still in double digits at least for the biggest and most systemically important banks. From the recent infamous Archegos example, we saw that playing with leverage-amplifying synthetic market instruments (total return swaps in Bill Hwang\u2019s case) is like playing with matches - and it will almost certainly lead to dire consequences at some point in time. Poor Bill just was the first one to run out of luck.\n\nAnother important factor to bear in mind, is that those professional financial ANALysts seem to follow a similar risks assessment approach that is used by an average WSB retard buying FDs. No, I\u2019m not kidding, they literally stick to a bit more sophisticated version of a famous postulate: \u2018Stonks only go up\u2019. We are talking about VaR, or Value at Risk models. u\/peruvian_bull managed to explain this complex stuff in a brilliant way in his series of posts dedicated to the highly probable upcoming financial market fiasco (fascinating reading - in this part of the series, 1987 famous crash is discussed and how derivatives and improper risks assessment exacerbated it):\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/zfh3tjyk83j71.jpg?width=1507&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fb308013aac7d7c65f8cbf5130cf7a5d7abf2373\n\n>Even to this day, Regulators, and indeed even financial industry insiders, are completely blind to the risk. OTC Derivatives are essentially unregulated - NO ONE knows the true size of this market. Worse yet, the traders inside the bank are using optimistic versions of the Efficient Market Hypothesis and VaR models to estimate their risk, which comes out to essentially 0 due to the risk models and net exposure hedging. Thus, they pile on more risk every day, ensuring that this problem continues to grow - until the entire system explodes.\n\n  \nNo wonder, that in such a financial environment as described above, cases like GME would be given a five-sigma label. The best analogy to describe current financial market conditions would be a castle made of sand, when one sea wave of a higher magnitude can easily crash the whole thing into the dirt; or a house of cards, when just one stronger blow of the wind will trigger a chain reaction and demolish it to the fundament. The current status quo is not self-sustainable, and very soon it will become also a not FED-sustainable. The markets have been artificially supported by the money supply expansion for too long, currently resembling a drugs addict, who can\u2019t live without the always following stimulus \u201cdose\u201d. As soon as liquidity dries up for a brief moment (sucked in by some negative beta bad boy), or the FED blinks... I guess, we\u2019ll find out really soon what happens then.\n\nTo conclude and sum up the second chapter, quoting u\/peruvian_bull again:\n\n>**As long as money keeps flowing into the Casino, the gamblers feel little risk, so no one pulls out. The Fed continues to print money, equity\/bond prices continue to rise, and since there\u2019s \u201cno risk\u201d of the underlying falling in value, everyone keeps their money in the pot, and the poker game continues.**  \n>  \n>**The profits made from derivatives trading are enormous, and any bank that stopped doing this would quickly lose investors, because they would instantly take their capital out and take it to another bank that actually is profitable. It's all a confidence game - as long as everyone is confident, prices keep rising, and the cash keeps pumping in, the party will continue.**\n\n# \n\n# Chapter III. The Sword of Damocles (and the bet)\n\n  \nWell, here comes the party pooper, or it\u2019s more appropriate to say, the party shitter:\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/nw7vw0dk93j71.png?width=1860&format=png&auto=webp&s=7add7132ece80231f1451c88ba69ed3edd3878c7\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ebo8be5r93j71.png?width=1862&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d68afe9f815a7723b6058a24db193828b419282\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/kqwqmy9t93j71.png?width=1860&format=png&auto=webp&s=1618e8580829574b8f3df117d5e837287e043405\n\nConnecting the dots: when there is too much risk in the system, it becomes less and less sustainable, so that potentially even a short but sudden and intense surge in volatility may demolish the whole house of ~~leverage~~cards. Anything may cause a fatal error in such a system, even an old man\u2019s fart with the sigma of five. In our example however, it\u2019s when crazy retail jumps on the hype train, and buys over-shorted stonk like there\u2019s no tomorrow, things look like this:\n\n* GME shares added more than 500% in less than two days, showing off its negative beta in all glory,\n* making VIX volatility index explode more than 60% in a day,\n* and injuring SPY badly (sharp decline of about 4% in 21 hours).\n\nThat was just a preview.\n\nLate January events are extraordinary, that\u2019s for sure. But, you know, extraordinary things happen too, and it\u2019s plainly stupid not to hedge in such circumstances, as Robbinhood did in this story. That was a vivid example of an extremely poor risk management, prevalent on the financial markets currently. This factor, coupled with the excessive margin exploitation (e.g. a fucking reported triple digits SI, dafuq?), will consequently result in the financial crisis, which is currently on its way (remember, crises love September and October).\n\nAfter a rather fascinating set of circumstances, GME situation seems to have become the needle to burst the bubble, that\u2019s why big financial boys use all of their dirty tricks, flirting with an illusion of a controllable chaos. However, any manipulation has its end, and it is a double edged sword (of Damocles). The market will punish the bad actors, as it has always done so in the past - and the good guys will be remunerated. Again, GME is not the reason of the upcoming market crash, but rather a trigger, and in the current financial environment anything could work as a substitute. What was that quote from the \u2018Butterfly Effect\u2019 movie? Oh,  \n\n\n>It has been said that something as insignificant as the gases emitted from an anus of an old man can ultimately cause a financial typhoon all around the world...\n\n**Enough words and quotes. This is my bet: GME to thousands in a couple of months, while the new financial crisis unveiling, or I\u2019m not only shaving off my beard (which I wasn\u2019t really afraid of loosing, tbh, as it would grow back in a couple of months) but also this, my real treasure:**\n\nhttps:\/\/reddit.com\/link\/pa03sf\/video\/m0gwzvob43j71\/player\n\n**And here is why I\u2019m so confident in my bet and its timing:**\n\n[SPY daily chart](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/w51ks5l2b3j71.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7c7374f9a4f3d991386a6fea8c6b66108354d8f4)\n\nI mean, SPY is cooked. What's outlined on the TA above is a massive bearish formation, ready to push the market off the cliff it has been climbing all this time. In my opinion, that's going to be just the first wave of the nasty downside movement, and a very sharp and painful one. Considering the longer term setup, explained [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/mwevzz\/the_big_short_20_why_bears_may_soon_reconsider\/), and [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/o0fjdb\/this_time_its_different\/), the technical (as well as fundamentals, as discussed above) conditions resemble the perfect storm brewing. Now, while it's all calm before that storm, enjoy the last sunny and warm days (and, maybe, it's a good idea to fix some profits, dunno). September and October will be fun. Especially for GME with its negative beta.\n\n[VIX daily chart](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/mcg9etbeh3j71.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=728359435209bdb792327427e3cea524528d6908)\n\n[GME daily chart, log scale](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/xbskfzdkh3j71.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3c2451c6bc584e43f1497d8ca6acc141cb8e21d4)\n\n**TL;DR: My SS thesis and its core idea is more than alive with GME (proven by AMC example), and even though any major price action movement has been suppressed in an attempt to keep things under control by big financial players, the buying pressure is there and it's as strong as it has ever been. The financial system is over-levereged, way more than it was in 2008, and coupled with the industry poor risk assessment standarts ('average WSB retard'-like or worse), it is heading to the next financial crisis (and crashes love autumn). This factor, considering GME's negative beta, will likely trigger the next powerful bull run for GME, sucking in the liquidity from the fearful and already-illiquid markets, resulting in colossal volatility typhoon. Either that, or I'mma be completely bold this winter.**","769":"Stocks With High Fails to Deliver and Correlation to Stock Price After &#x200B;\n\n[GME FTDs](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/57uswqvuzch71.png?width=1281&format=png&auto=webp&s=14d9145ee31a7fca0d704226eff6ab8986204cc6)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[AMC FTDs](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/5uibpnyxzch71.png?width=1232&format=png&auto=webp&s=c1c645956f3b8cbeab091740e8bc5d117bc455c5)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[CLOV FTDs](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/rlhnq3g00dh71.png?width=1206&format=png&auto=webp&s=baddf93a3c17fc2fa2554645861ef6d7a9eab576)\n\n  \n\nI know GME AMC and CLOV are not the same and I am not here to bash either GME or AMC just pointing out some similarities between the three.

Then the squeeze abruptly came to an end when GME\u2019s short interest declined to less than 10% of shares outstanding. Stock borrow rates collapsed in tandem. The stock dropped to $40 per share and the short squeeze was over. As many of you put it, the squeeze was squeezed. That part of the trade had concluded. \n\nAMC also experienced a squeeze, or more accurately, the perception that a squeeze could happen. Rapid and sustained buying caused share volumes to explode and the stock price to appreciate quickly (we think this may have been ignited by unusually large call option buying).  Hedge funds who were short needed to post 5-10x the collateral previously required to hold a short AMC position. Buyers, including and maybe especially retail traders, continued to overwhelm sellers. As that occurred at the end of May and early June, AMC shares ran up to $72 per share. Wave after wave of retail buyer piled in hoping to make life-changing money.  Some did.  \n\nThe problem is the squeeze (or, more accurately, the perception of the squeeze) ended, and now the stock is drifting lower every day. The amount of AMC shares short relative to its market cap and trading volume has never been that high and is currently declining. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/kuyjlumh0zd71.png?width=458&format=png&auto=webp&s=7af96d60af7932c3117851ae40d9cdad8b988d29\n\nBorrow rates are consequently diminishing as well - shorting doesn't cost that much anymore (less than 2% per year) and there is plenty of borrow available. If you need to cover your short, you can do so pretty easily. For example, if you\u2019re short 1 million shares, you can cover that before breakfast with recent trading volumes and it wouldn\u2019t move the stock at all. Remember, covering a short is simply buying shares in the market at the prevailing price. AMC trades over 50 million shares a day. People keep yelling \u201cthey have to cover!\u201d Or, \u201cwe own the float!\u201d Both of those things are true. But when someone wants to cover, they don\u2019t need to ask for everyone\u2019s permission. They just need to buy stock in the market at the current price much like people in this community buy stock every single day from people that are selling it. That\u2019s how it works.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/9lne56ti0zd71.png?width=458&format=png&auto=webp&s=fff4c1d06207b571e3adbc8f41d37149e149ec4a\n\nFinally, hedge funds that are short AMC are doing so in small size relative to the size of their funds. In other words, most are assuming over 200% price appreciation in their downside scenarios and have plenty of collateral in reserve to place against the short position they are maintaining if the short goes against them. For all intents and purposes, they can hold these short positions forever. This is not a recipe for a short squeeze.\n\n**AMC is not GameStop.** \n\nAfter the GME squeeze ended, GameStop continued transforming itself. GameStop raised a ton of cash ($500 million in April), paid down all its debt, and then raised even more cash ($1 billion in June). In the midst of cleaning up its capital structure, Ryan Cohen hired an experienced team of top-notch managers. GameStop (current market cap: $14.5 billion) now has a real shot at becoming a successful niche online retailer of gaming accessories and related products that competes effectively against Amazon. Investors are now betting that Ryan Cohen can make GameStop as successful as his last company Chewy (current market cap: $35 billion). Chewy captured market share from Amazon and others in the pet food and accessories market on its way to becoming a very large and thriving business.  Investors hope GameStop will do the same against Amazon, Best Buy and others.  \n\nThe value reflected in GameStop\u2019s current market cap is driven mostly by an optimistic bet on this transformation. The gamble on the short squeeze is over. GME is trading fairly rationally right now \u2013 maybe a little expensive considering the road to $35 billion is going to be really bumpy. GameStop\u2019s valuation is not completely detached from reality in that GameStop has a good chance at succeeding. \n\nAMC, on the other hand, has traded from the realm of the improbable into the universe of the impossible. AMC is stuck with its old management team and is pursuing the same tired strategy of trying to get people to fill theaters even though every content provider, including video game producers, are pushing consumers to enjoy and participate in content at home. AMC does not have Ryan Cohen. It has Adam Aaron who is struggling to steer AMC through $5 billion in debt and growing rent obligations. With this debt burden, and with zero history of being an entrepreneurial visionary like Ryan Cohen, Adam Aaron will not be able to attract the kind of talent Ryan Cohen can recruit. Consequently, AMC doesn\u2019t have a shot at competing against Disney, Netflix, Amazon and every other streamer. AA\u2019s only hope is to cynically appeal to apes so that you keep buying his stock. My bet is that he\u2019s going to have to deliver a lot more than free popcorn to keep people buying.\n\nBut enough of my opinions. Here are the facts. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/zia6u1mj0zd71.png?width=510&format=png&auto=webp&s=07ac2e7e676c7ffe15957086337e4174696b2c7b\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/wm4q3b4k0zd71.png?width=506&format=png&auto=webp&s=a03689104ff0bfabdaef53a94c12c7c2c75b13e6\n\nClearly, 2021 box office is well below 2018 box office on both a cumulative and weekly basis.  But yes, we are in a pandemic, and theaters are closed, so let\u2019s look at revenue per theater.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/f8fj54nk0zd71.png?width=506&format=png&auto=webp&s=d7bf2b12ff11fcd2d6bea2a4a6bc73a75e9d3701\n\nAlthough improving, 2021 box office per theater is well below 2018. Even last week, when Disney released its expected blockbuster Black Widow, box office per theater is well below 2018 levels.  The reason for this is actually pretty straightforward. The battle for viewers is no longer in the theater. It\u2019s at home. In 2018, Netflix, Hulu and Disney+ combined had 164 million subscribers. Now they have over 350 million. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/w1nawg2l0zd71.png?width=325&format=png&auto=webp&s=165d1c90746723ed10c03b1252323166110c854c\n\nThe major studios are no longer competing against each other. They are competing against Netflix and Amazon. In 2018, Netflix and Amazon produced 77 films. In 2020, they produced 145, most of which were never intended to be displayed in theaters. Amazon recently bought The Tomorrow War from Paramount for over $200 million. Rather than releasing it in theaters, Amazon digitally released it instead on Prime Video. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/nqxll5gl0zd71.png?width=328&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ceab142dbb333a09f82687d6307ad4b0c4a68a1\n\nA lot of Redditors say \u201cwell, AMC makes most of its money on concessions.\u201d That is actually not true. Over 62% of AMC\u2019s revenue and 48% of AMC\u2019s gross profit comes from actual ticket sales. Even if it were true, people need to visit theaters in order to buy popcorn and candy and soda, so tickets and concessions are joined at the hip. You can\u2019t have one without the other. \n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/0yakedbm0zd71.png?width=937&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0f523348018dc1ef621eadff4e7fcc8975c2e4c\n\n**Conclusion** \n\nI'm not telling you what to do.

A closer look at Gamma Exposure  I agree that GME is getting close for  a rip. From a TA perspective, its trading in a high volume area. When I look at GME from a weekly time frame, Money Flow has been increasing over the last 4 weeks, this usually tells me its under accumulation. I saw this move in AMZN before it ripped. But as we all know, It is very difficult to time a move.\n\nSince Options dictate a lot of moves, I like to take look at how MM's are  positioned with GEX or known as Gamma Exposure. Gamma Exposure is really good if you like to sell options overall as it can provide information where Gamma Walls are at. Also can use it to know when to take profits. For example, on $DIS there is a Call Gamma Wall at 185. On Monday I took some profits on my calls since it is close to that PT.\n\nNow back to GME. We are currently in  neg gamma territory and under a put wall at 170. If we cant close above  this tomorrow, we could see 150 imo, the next high neg gamma area which I  believe should provide good support.

This is a fictional account and not investment advice.\n\n# Preface\n\nToday is Wednesday July 14th, 2021. As you can see, GME has been selling off on very low volume and really accelerated today, along with many other caca stocks that are starting to make their way back down to hell after a nice consolation bounce out of the May lows. Many will break May lows and never recover, FYI.\n\nGME is special, though, as it is the Queen of caca stocks standing steadfast beside King TSLA who retired from greatness after the SPX add and has a date with 400. For both, many would say they are not caca and have fundamental upside. Maybe they do, maybe they don't. What we do know is GME low float, high SI and is subject to gamma squeezes (helped by short covering) and that is what we are looking for come August to September as we watch for a pattern to repeat itself.\n\n# Where we are at\n\nToday just before close, GME found a potential bottom at 165 with huge volume which is peculiarly right where we have several supports:\n\n7) The positive trendline running from the extremely bullish engulfing candle just after the earnings gap down in March to the beginning of the breakout in May heading into Q2 ER.\n\n2) The all-time-highs AVWAP which basically encapsulates the average of volume and price since the day GME sent Gabe home crying. Like moving averages, above is bullish ( \ud83d\ude80 ) and below it is bearish (\ud83c\udf08).\n\n4) Thicc volume shelves from $100-150 where most volume has traded since January, indicating where traders have been interested in buying in the past, and where those who sold at highs or missed the boat the first time may find value in entering.\n\n6) 151 is a pivotal level related to some gamma\/greek mysticism. As we saw after hours today, price hit 151.01 and bounced for 9 pts. Below 151 is certain death, or possibly a 200-day MA test around 110 (orange line)\n\nNot only are we at these multiple, coinciding levels of support, we are in the midst of oversold territory with daily RSI at 33, its lowest reading since before most of you were born (April 3, 2020, $2.80 close). *An aside: What a long way GME has come to be knocking at the year-to-date RSI lows and closing at almost $168, OG GME bull* \/u\/Uberkikz11 *and the GMEdd team's bull case fair value target released on 1\/20\/21. Market weighing machine well at work. Cheers, Rod.*\n\nBut wait! There's more: While GME is in oversold territory, SPX and especially NQ\/FAGMAN are well overbought and starting to show weakness here at monthly OpEx with AAPL now carrying all of the weight. We've seen money flow to the safe haven of GME in times of hedging need. Should the indexes pull back starting as soon as tomorrow (Thursday 7\/15) or sometime next week, the money that was made dumping tech on retail at ATHs will find its way somewhere, and in the past it has been GME (and boomer value stocks). Watch AAPL weakness for clues.\n\nAll this being said, today I would put us at or around 3\/24 in the quarterly cycle. Especially with the NFLX news knocking us down even lower into oversold territory with support at 151, our capitulation may be in.\n\n# Where we are going\n\nAll these factors are indicating that, should patterns repeat, GME is ripe for a bounce in the near future, and it could be a nice 40-60 pt ripper up to resistance levels at the 20 or 50 day MAs around 200, or one of the other two swing high AVWAPs above (207, 235).\n\nAt the very least, from the after hours action we will open gapped-down with gap to fill at 167. Could fill now, could fill next week, could fill never.\n\nNow, I don't think we are going to see a breakout with continuation until we get to mid August, for another \\~4 week run up into earnings. As you can see between Q1-Q2 ER, we caught a 64 pt dragon dong oversold bounce out of the 3\/24 capitulation candle, and after that came two months of consolidation where GME was pinned in a relatively tight range in order to let IV die down, cheapen OTM calls for large in scale buying, and let shorts get comfy enough to catch them off guard.\n\n# GamePlan\n\n**Immediate term:** Watch price action tomorrow AM for a rip out of open which dips may be bought, or a sell at open to re-test 151, followed by a reversal on increased volume if 151 holds and shit starts hitting the fan on NQ\/SPX. If it doesn't reverse strongly but holds 151, look for basing to occur with more volume to come in possibly in the afternoon, eventually bringing volatile movements to the upside. The basing could take a while, might not start getting interesting until Friday afternoon into close.\n\nIF we don't get a strong reversal by end of this week, but hold 151, look for a dip-to-moon or rip straight out of the gates on Monday.\n\nTargets are the upper resistance levels 198, 209, 235. Don't be greedy.\n\nIF we lose 151, let it die some more. If you liked GME at 483, you'll love it in the low 100s. Don't try to catch the falling knife, you will get cut. Possible supports at 151, 137, 110, 48, 40. Wait for confirmation.\n\n**Earnings play:** Watch for price to consolidate for a few weeks after any bounce, identify the consolidation range and look for entries at the low end of the range around August OpEx 8\/20. Sell into strength BEFORE earnings.\n\n# Footnotes\n\nPositions: 7\/16 170c, 180c, 190c, 7\/23 190c. Be realistic with OTM calls. 800c will not print.\n\nObligatory rockets: \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nDisclaimer: This is for entertainment purposes only.

The stock earlier fell as low as $33.25 to its lowest point since June 1.\n\nGameStop finished down 6.9% at $167.62 after hitting a session low of $165.07, compared with its June 8 high of $344.66. GameStop, which hit a record high of $483 in late January, also registered a fourth straight day of declines.\n\nThe companies have been at the center of epic rallies in so-called meme stocks that have captivated Wall Street, hurt bearish hedge funds and raised the profile of retail investors. Both are still sitting on big year-to-date gains. AMC was still up 1,476% so far in 2021 while GameStop was up 789% for the year to date.\n\nTheir recent declines may test the individual investors that have purchased their shares in recent months, often touting their buys on sites such as Reddit's popular WallStreetBets.\n\n\"When things are going up it's easy to get on board,\" said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa. \"It could go significantly lower because there's less interest in the trade. People hate to lose money much more than they love to make money.\"\n\nThe decline in AMC shares came even after a strong weekend at the box office, when Walt Disney Co and Marvel's superhero adventure movie \"Black Widow\" captured $80 million in the biggest opening weekend for a movie since the pandemic.\n\nDollarhide noted that Disney also generated $60 million globally from selling the movie on its direct-to-consumer streaming service, which competes with movie theaters.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic kept theaters and other businesses shuttered for months. Concerns about the surge in cases of the latest COVID-19 variant may be exacerbating declines in so-called reopening stocks such as AMC, according to MKM Partners analyst Eric Handler.\n\n\"It's a stock that was trading up very high because it was a momentum trade and when the momentum dries up a little bit it comes down,\" Handler said.\n\nFor the full year 2021, AMC is expected to report an adjusted loss per share of $3.16 on revenue of $2.41 billion. For its fiscal year ending in January 2022, GameStop is expected to report a loss per share of $0.56 on revenue of $5.57 billion. Estimates for both companies were collected by Refinitiv. As of Tuesday's close, about 78 million shares of AMC, or almost 16% of its float, were sold short, according to the latest estimate from S3 Partners. That compares with 75 million shares sold short as of June 30.\n\nAbout 8.68 million shares in GameStop, or 14.9% of its float, was sold short as of Tuesday's close, compared with 8.22 million on June 30, according to S3.\n\n(Reporting By Sin\u00e9ad Carew; Editing by Nick Zieminski and Will Dunham)","780":"Current State of $GME and $AMC - Unbiased Technical Analysis Had to post again because a sentence in my previous post caused it to be deleted.\n\nI apologize in advance for not confirming anyone's bias - if that's what you are looking for stop reading now.\n\nSome of you might know me from my previous AMC\/GME analysis where I detailed the setup for the most recent runs:\n\n[https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/nexq9s\/gme\\_ta\\_big\\_breakout\\_today\\_setup\\_looks\\_better\\_than\/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/nexq9s\/gme_ta_big_breakout_today_setup_looks_better_than\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n[https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/nfg8mj\/amc\\_ta\\_broke\\_out\\_big\\_last\\_week\\_best\\_setup\\_since\/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/nfg8mj\/amc_ta_broke_out_big_last_week_best_setup_since\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nI've been getting a lot of requests for this, and seen a **ton** of completely false technical analysis for these names, so I figured I would clear the air and provide an **unbiased** roadmap from someone with no position.\n\nLet's dig into the charts -\n\n[$GME 1Y 1D](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/4mbrhsb7v1b71.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e328ffbaf0c02398074e571f7e7c88ed860337c)\n\nStarting with $GME, let's break it down color by color:\n\n**(RED)**\n\nAscending triangle coming from upside. These are more likely to have a bullish outcome. However, this is on a longer timeframe. It would break up above **344** and targets **400 --> 450 --> 500.** You would want a daily close to seal the deal. This setup breaks down and is invalid below **163,** from there - no support until **145.**\n\n**(TEAL)**\n\nDescending channel coming from downside. This are bearish in nature. It means the near term trend is down and likely to stay that way unless we break above the upper boundary with a daily close. In this case, you would need a break above **209,** which would target **241.26, 274.29, 291.30 -** and **maybe** the top of the pattern at **344.** Until then, it is sell the rip short term.\n\nWhen a pattern breaks against it's bias - the resulting move is often less pronounced and I look for about half the move I would look for if it broke with it's bias. That's why in this scenario, if we broke above, you would want to see it form a **bull flag, falling wedge, or ascending triangle (continuation pattern)** to get that true follow through to the far end.\n\nThis breaks down with the red setup below that **163** level.\n\n(**YELLOW)**\n\nThese are price levels on the 1 year chart. They are as follows from top to bottom - **291.30, 274.29, 241.26, 205.49, 189.66.** Below, they are resistance. Above, they are support. Under the pattern, support is **145.00, 100.00.**\n\nMoving onto $AMC -\n\n[$AMC 1Y 1D](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/xn42mhw5v1b71.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=7785ff88f6b50dedbc23436c5b235dad4ae3e759)\n\n**(RED)**\n\nWith that large bounce on **7\/8 -** this has actually become a **falling wedge.** These are **bullish** in nature. That being said, we are obviously in danger of breaking it down today. For that to not happen, we must hold **38.54** on every daily close, sloping down each day. Below, **the setup is invalid** and nearby support is at **36.77** and **33.61.**\n\nThe pattern breaks up on a daily close above **55.00** sloping down each day. Price targets for the breakout would be **65.10, 75.00, 100.00.**\n\n**(YELLOW)**\n\nThese are price levels on the 1 year chart. They are as follows from top to bottom - **65.10, 61.18, 51.00, 36.77, 33.61, 20.46, 16.79.** There is a few more but they are so far away there is no reason to plot them. I try to keep my charts as clean as possible.\n\nNote the gap at **33.61 -** this is also one of the most important supports on the chart. Gaps like to be filled, and it's likely we do fill this one.\n\nRemember a breakdown is always confirmed by a candle close on it's respective chart, in this case the daily. For that reason, we could see a candle wick under - fill the gap - wick back over. A close under that level would be very unhealthy and likely mark a move back to **20.46.** This is the highest probability point to go short.\n\n\\---\n\n*Keep in mind technical analysis is a road map, not a crystal ball.

This hot off the presses steaming pile of trash has it all: charts **and** text! With a side of **disappointment** and **shattered dreams**! All for the low price of wasting time you didn't need anyway!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Table of Contents:**\n\nPart 1. The Meme Demystified\n\nPart 2. The Meme Charts\n\n1. GME\n2. AMC\n3. BB\n4. BBBY\n5.

The Meme Demystified**\n\nMy basic thesis for the meme stocks is that they are all following a relatively similar, and somewhat predictable pattern. There was a recent post here that claimed all the meme stocks were totally different plays. This is wrong. In fact, they are all basically the same play, with some variation. Here is a list of the essential elements of the meme stock pattern:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. **Memes**: This just boils down to retail attention; DDs, memes, ppl posting stupid yolos, etc.\n2. **Option wizardry**: Seeing there is a 'new thing' over on the ol' internets and it's going up, some big money motherfuckers starting buying call options in stupid quantities, forcing market makers to hedge, **the thing** then happens.\n3. **Diamond handing**: A bunch of idiots catch a case of FOMO and pile into the stock at terrible prices, then once they're sitting on devastating losses, they say to themselves: 'you know I *always* believed in this company' and promptly declare they are diamond handed apes, and they'll *never* sell.\n4. **Higher-low**: The refusal to sell by the ~~retards~~ brilliant new investors who see value that others don't, *causes* the rapidly falling stock price to stabilize at a new higher-low, proving the case that their diamond handing actually did something.\n5. Go back to 1 and repeat for another leg higher.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLooking at the charts in the next part, it's my contention that the higher-low should be at the same level the stock broke out of on the prior move. In other words: spike, drop to breakout, stabilize there, spike again, drop to second breakout, stabilize there, ... repeat until lambo.\n\nSPCE is an example of a case were the stock fell all the way back down after it's early year breakouts, but I'm not sure it ever properly fit the pattern.\n\n***There's no fucking pattern, dipshit. TA doesn't work on meme stocks! It's just randomness!!!!*** I hear you typing in your comment. I see a pattern in these moves. Further, the underlying mechanism of call option wizardry appears the same as well (GME, part 1, notwithstanding). As does the effect of diamond handing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------\n\n**Part 2. The Meme Charts**\n\nFirst, let me say the State of the Memes this week is **wounded**.  As the charts show, across the board (except SPCE) the whole of Memelandia got pretty well beat to shit.\n\nStarting with GME:\n\n[GME](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ukgcqozlnma71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c3c70553d72942ff2d3e936e46239c6df908ef6)\n\nGME has completed four rounds on the wheel of lambos. It is, like all the meme stocks, experiencing the early stages of a break down of the pattern. You can fiddle around with where you think Launch #4 should be drawn and put it around $195, then squint and turn you head a little to the right and everything will look just dandy.\n\nIs GME dead? No. Just wounded. Get back up into the Support Zone #4 and it's game on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNext AMC:\n\n[AMC](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/dbivb5gkoma71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=1766b652351e92f9201c28b4fef1031796eaaa32)\n\nAMC is that weird kid you went to school with. He was nice enough, but it was always a little awkward to hang out with him. Like you were never quite sure what he was going to do\/say next. The reason underlying this is likely the fact that y'all bought damn-near the whole company already.\n\nIs AMC dead? No. It's a weirdo that I expect should drop all the way back to $14.54 before finding support. But at this point it could literally do anything. (Except go up again. That's definitely not happening until we get some kind of consolidation ... somewhere.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEveryone's favorite Canadian, BB:\n\n[Oh, Canada!](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/6haay06epma71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=52acbe79317f76bf4a9e43636c87a34890197c38)\n\nNot too shabby, not too great. Like the last girl you took home from the bar. You didn't have to get *that* drunk to make the call, but you weren't going to pick her sober.\n\nIs BB dead? No. We've broken under Support Zone #3 (or #2, if you don't want to count the Dec jump as a proper meme launch). However, we haven't completely collapsed, and if you know anything about TA, you know that you can just redraw the lines to reinforce that poorly thought out decision you made when you entered the position in the first place.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGreat bedside table selection, BBBY:\n\n[I really like these bedside tables... that I got from Wayfair.](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/e0d1mj63qma71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3cefbc8df2ff395550d482556355d6bc7f8fe17)\n\nNobody talks about this ticker any more, but it actually looks like its in the best shape of the bunch.\n\nIs BBBY dead? Absolutely not. In fact, I'm thinking of using margin to hop aboard (cause almost all my money is tied up ~~bagholding~~ *with a long term investment in* CLOV). It found support this week right where it was supposed to and it ended the week with green candles. Maybe being forgotten about around here is a good thing.....\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLeprechaun 8, The Night of Broken Dreams, CLOV:\n\n[I might have to visit a church..... how much do favors from Jesus cost, anyway?](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/9swz2j03rma71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6333324df38e3cf30320f0b63f85547e0caead6)\n\nI'm really, really, *really*, hoping my thesis that the price needs to stabilize at the previous breakout point is wrong. Or that I'm drawing the breakout lines wrong. Or that Buddy Jesus is going to forgive me for all those hookers and all that cocaine. I'm sorry, okay!\n\nIs CLOV dead? No, but it just got kicked straight in the nuts and is lying on the ground writhing in pain wondering why a girl that likes you would kick you in the balls to show that she likes you. The $9 mark is basically the last hope. Unless you want to look to SPCE for your comparison (but that's just cherry picking charts to find one that helps you sleep at night; you know, standard practice for TA)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRocketman, Sir Big-balls Branson, SPCE:\n\n[Expect more rockets](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/s8t2qm06sma71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed9ab72b20cd2f0662e9d3c64168c98454a63bc5)\n\nI'm not convinced this chart belongs with the others, but I squinted really hard and kinda sorta see how it might fit the pattern. There is just so much extra going on with SPCE that it is not going to play nice for TA.\n\nIs SPCE dead? Of course not. Branson survived, and that means SPCE is going to be just fine.

Failboat**\n\nThis is by no means an exhaustive list of the failures, but RKT and WOOF stand out to me as examples of Team Fail.\n\nFirst, the not-rocketman, RKT:\n\n[This is not the way to the moon](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/kbsinyb3tma71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=db532489fb141a71183654af327c744cb68851d8)\n\nNo matter how you redraw my breakout line, this is a clear fail. In fact, after the push up, the stock put in an all-time **low**. That is not how you get a lambo.\n\nIs RKT dead? As a meme stock, yes. Dead and buried. As a long term investment? I could see the case for it, I guess...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnlike, WOOF, which is just hot garbage blended into your dog's food:\n\n[Rocket ship to the Center of Earth.

I don't think so. This is P&D action.\n\nIs WOOF dead? In all ways, yes. Wasn't there a pet company during the dotcom bubble that went tits up....? Some lessons need to be learned twice it seems.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------\n\n**Part 4. The Week Ahead**\n\nAs I said at the beginning of Part 2, the State of the Meme is **wounded**. Last week's action was bad, across the board for everyone not in SPCE (or somehow, someway, for reasons I'll never understand, holding NEGG....). It's not over yet, though. Wounded is not dead. Hell, even dead can just be *mostly* dead. That's what the Princess Bride taught me, and I've learned everything I know from movies, so it must be true.\n\nHowever, a stand **must** be made. A line in the sand **must** be drawn. Someone, somewhere, needs to stand up and say **enough is enough**. We are ~~human beings~~ *just oversized children* god-damnit!\n\nIf we have another week of across the board bleeding, shit has the potential to go south, and fast. On top of it, this coming week has a bunch of options expiring because monthlys. Expect maximum pressure. When you've got your opponent on his back foot, you don't let off, you hit harder. If they smell blood in the water--and the charts look to me like blood in the water--they are going to try to finish the job and obliterate the Defenders of Memelandia once and for all.\n\nDo I honestly think the whole of \"the Suits\" is some cabal that would like to see this crazy ass party stop? No. I'm quite sure a bunch of them are on the long-side of these moves. They ***are*** the Options Wizards. But there are definitely some that want this boat roll over and if it looks like they can do it, then they go for it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Good luck, and may the lambos be with you.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPositions or ban:\n\n[CLOV & F, a fateful pairing....](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/dhka7jy0yma71.jpg?width=1921&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ee57b075cdaafef09b519b1491e6d911d60f2aa3)\n\nEdits for spelling\/grammar, because OCD.","783":"If the DD involves a \u201cshort squeeze\u201d\u2026 ignore it.

There\u2019ve been a lot of phenomenal sentiment trackers around WSB, and wanted to give a results-first take on that approach \u2014 what I did was create one that focuses just one what people in this sub are saying. I\u2019ve created my own sentiment analyzer, and have been investing in it for more than a year now. If you want to take a crack at using it yourself, here\u2019s the\u00a0[source code](https:\/\/github.com\/tstewart161\/Reddit_Sentiment_Trader).\n\nNOTE: A popular sentiment investing ETF is a banned ticker, so I just called it Popular Sentiment Investing ETF\n\n# The Important Stuff\n\nLong story short for the week -- you'll $WISH you had $AMC in your portfolio last week, and...eh I got nothing. Anyways, when you compare this sentiment tracker to the benchmark social sentiment ETF, Popular Sentiment Investing ETF, this one wins hands down. **This algorithm has returned 55% since March 2 (when** Popular Sentiment Investing ETF **came out), compared to SPY's 10% and** Popular Sentiment Investing ETF's **7%.**\n\nI rebalanced my portfolio last week to include the 15 stocks below (equal-weighted), giving me a \\*\\*2.18% return week over week (net of any fees\/slippage), compared to a 0.39% loss for SPY and 0.66% loss for my benchmark, the VanEck Popular Sentiment Investing ETF. **Important to note that not every week is a breakout win** (even if some member stocks in the ETF are), and not every week is a win at all. I've had some weeks where I've trailed both SPY and Popular Sentiment Investing ETF by a lot, but overall I'm beating SPY YTD and Popular Sentiment Investing ETF since its introduction.\u00a0\n\nYour typical sentiment analysis stuff coming through. I do this stuff for fun and make money off the stocks I pick doing it most weeks, so thought I'd share. I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. In addition to scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I also logged the popularity of the comment (giving it something similar to an exponential weight -- the more upvotes, the higher on the comment chain and the more people usually see it) and\/or post, and finally checked for the sentiment of each comment\/self text post.\n\n# How is sentiment calculated?\n\nThis uses VADER ( Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning), which is a model used for text sentiment analysis that is sensitive to both polarity (positive\/negative) and intensity (strength) of emotion. The way it works is by relying on a dictionary that maps lexical (aka word-based) features to emotion intensities -- these are known as sentiment scores. The overall sentiment score of a comment\/post is achieved by summing up the intensity of each word in the text. In some ways, it's easy: words like \u2018love\u2019, \u2018enjoy\u2019, \u2018happy\u2019, \u2018like\u2019 all convey a positive sentiment. Also VADER is smart enough to understand the basic context of these words, such as \u201cdidn\u2019t really like\u201d as a rather negative statement. It also understands the emphasis of capitalization and punctuation, such as \u201cI LOVED\u201d which is pretty cool. Phrases like \u201cThe turkey was great, but I wasn\u2019t a huge fan of the sides\u201d have sentiments in both polarities, which makes this kind of analysis tricky -- essentially with VADER you would analyze which part of the sentiment here is more intense. There\u2019s still room for more fine-tuning here, but make sure to not be doing too much. There\u2019s a similar phenomenon with trying to hard to fit existing data in stats called overfitting, and you don\u2019t want to be doing that.\n\nThe best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not - or develop a strategy investing in these stocks before they go parabolic. \\*\\*Although the results from this algorithm have beaten benchmarked sentiment indices like Popular Sentiment Investing ETF (on a risk-adjusted basis), sentiment analysis is by no means a \u201clong term SPY-beating strategy.\u201d\\*\\* I\u2019m well aware that most of my crazy returns are from GME and AMC (and more recently, WISH).

The reception to the comment was poor \u2013 35 downvotes and counting. Upon reviewing responses to my comment, I realized that many people have a fundamental misunderstanding of CCs. I hope to clear some of those up and introduce in what may be a new strategy to those who read this.\n\n**What does it mean to sell covered calls?**\n\nTo sell a covered call means to buy 100 shares of a stock and then sell a call option against the shares. When you sell the call, you collect a premium upfront. If the underlying stock is above the strike price on the expiry date, you will get assigned. Since you are \u201ccovered\u201d and own 100 shares of the underlying, you can deliver your shares to the holder of the call to satisfy your obligation. If the stock is below the strike price on the expiry date, you get to keep the shares. In either situation, the premium is yours to keep.\n\nThis strategy is different than selling a naked call option (i.e., selling a call without owning the underlying). In that strategy, you lose $1 for every cent the stock is above the strike price at expiry. With CCs, you own 100 shares of the stock, so those 100 shares were also able to make $1 for every cent in price appreciation. In essence, with CCs you are selling the upside above the strike price to the long of the trade.\n\n**Three strategies compared under four scenarios**\n\nThe best way to demonstrate why I believe this strategy is so valuable is to compare trading outcomes under four strategies \u2013 selling covered calls, owning 100 shares outright, and owning a call option.\n\nFor this example, I will use AMC shares which last traded at $54.23 and a 55 strike July 2 expiry call which last traded at $4.25. This example is for AMC, but this can be done with any stock if you substitute the applicable pricing.\n\nIf this is too much reading, I\u2019ve summarized what I believe is the best trading strategy in each price band within the chart below.\n\n[Trading strategies compared](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/8c622ynpkw771.png?width=2604&format=png&auto=webp&s=8793805dbc8f0b621940bc7dc42bf1cb4d1b3640)\n\n*Scenario 1 \u2013 AMC goes down (Winner: tie between selling covered calls and owning a call)*\n\n* Selling covered calls: The shares will lose money; however, because you collected a premium, you are still ahead if AMC finishes above $49.98 ($54.23-$4.25). Even if AMC finishes below $49.98, you can \u201croll\u201d your option to a different expiry and collect more premium.\n* Owning 100 shares outright: The shares will lose money.\n* Owning a call: The call finishes out of the money and your loss is the premium paid of $425. I am giving this one a tie because if the stock tanks, the call has a 100% loss but in dollar terms the loss is limited. So in a sense the winner depends on how much the stock falls and if you believe the stock will recover in the future.\n\n*Scenario 2 \u2013 AMC stays at $54.23 (Winner: selling covered calls)*\n\n* Selling covered calls: The shares neither make nor lose money; however, you profit the premium received of $425. Since $54.23 is below the strike of $55, you can roll the option to a different expiry and collect more premium.\n* Owning 100 shares outright: The shares neither make nor lose money.\n* Owning a call: The call finishes out of the money and your loss is the premium paid of $425.\n\n*Scenario 3 \u2013 AMC finishes in the range of $55-$59.25 (Winner: tie between selling covered calls and owning 100 shares outright)*\n\n* Selling covered calls: The shares participate in the upside up until $55. This would mean a $77 profit on the shares (\\[$55-$54.23\\] x 100). You would also keep the premium of $425 which brings the total profit to $502. You would lose the shares as the stock finished above $55.\n* Owning 100 shares outright: The shares will gain money. Your profit would be the difference in the finishing price and $54.23, all multiplied by $100. So, if AMC finishes at $59.25, the profit would be $502 (\\[$59.25-$54.23\\] x 100).\n* Owning a call: The call finishes in the money; however, since you had to pay a premium, that must be subtracted from the gain. If the stock finishes at $59.25, you would breakeven (\\[$59.25-$55-$4.25\\] x 100).\n\n*Scenario 4 \u2013 AMC finishes above $59.68 (Winner: owning a call)*\n\n* Selling covered calls: Same as scenario 3. The profit is $502 and you lose your shares.\n* Owning 100 shares outright: The shares will gain money. Your profit would be the difference in the finishing price and $54.23, all multiplied by $100. If the stock finishes at $59.68, your profit would be $545.\n* Owning a call: The call finishes in the money; however, since you had to pay a premium, that must be subtracted from the gain. If the stock finishes at $59.68, your profit would be $42.69 (\\[$59.68-$55-$4.25\\] x 100). As a percentage of the original investment, this strategy has a higher ROI than owning 100 shares outright for stock prices above $59.68.\n\nThere are a few gaps in these scenarios, but the point should be clear by now. Selling covered calls is profitable in scenarios 2-4 and in scenario 1 if the stock is above $49.98. Owning 100 shares is profitable in scenarios 3 and 4 while owning a call was profitable in only scenario 4.\n\nThis is why I love selling covered calls \u2013 it is profitable in more market conditions than the other trading strategies. It will outperform other strategies unless the underlying stock makes a large move to the upside.\n\n**Misconceptions**\n\nI came across a few misconceptions in responses to my comment. Here are a few of them.\n\n*You can\u2019t make money on CCs if the stock goes up.* \u2013 Absolutely you would. If the stock goes up, you get to keep the premium. Only in selling a naked call would you not make money in this situation.\n\n*You shouldn\u2019t sell CCs on a high IV stock.* \u2013 Assuming you're bullish on the stock, high IV stocks are the best to target as you can collect more premium. This point is only correct if you anticipate a large downward move in the stock that would lose more than the premium received.\n\n*You should sell puts instead of CCs if you\u2019re bullish on the stock.* \u2013 There\u2019s some nuance to this, but this point is mostly incorrect. Due to something called put-call parity, selling a put is conceptually similar to selling a covered call. Both will benefit from the same price movements.\n\n**Downsides:**\n\nThere are a few downsides to CCs which you should consider before trading.\n\n*Funds required* \u2013 Selling covered calls requires owning 100 shares of the stock. This is capital intensive. Consider buying 100 shares of GME which would cost $20,800. Buying a GME July 2 expiry call with 0.71 delta (meaning you get price appreciation that replicates owning 71 shares) only costs about $2,443.\n\n*Stock tanks and never recovers* \u2013 If the stock tanks and never recovers, you won\u2019t be able to recoup your losses; however, even if this happens, your outcome is better than the other strategies from before since you got to keep the premium.\n\n*The upside is limited* \u2013 Your upside is capped at the strike price. If there\u2019s a strong movement upwards, the other strategies are better; however, there may be situations where you call \u201croll\u201d your option up in strike and out in expiry. This may allow you to keep stock.\n\nConclusion: Selling covered calls are an underrated trading strategy that is often misunderstood. It is profitable in a wide range of trading environments. Sure it may not be as \"sexy\" as buying FDs and it won't get you rich overnight, but it can possibly provide strong and consistent returns over time.","787":"GME building up for another squeeze? \ud83d\ude80 I know i've been off of reddit for awhile but don't be worried...

How can GME per stock value reach 10 million if that makes the worth of GME more than everything in the solar system combined. Am I missing something here? are there things I am not considering?\n\nthanks","792":"Stick with AMC. But if you do diversify into another hopeful.......

But theres so many other fakes, wannabes, bots and spams, its hard to get above it.\n\nStick with AMC and GME, our Godfathers.\n\nEven our own Subreddit, people agree, we don't want to distract from AMC or GME.

PLTR has come up in this subreddit a lot in the past and people have been burned on it as well. I've lost thousands on PLTR but i'm still holding because the company is beyond incredible. One of the biggest questions i've seen that nobody truly understands is \"What is Palantir? What do they do?\", so let me attempt to explain wtf they do... Precursor, this isn't an in-depth analyses of PLTR fundamentals and financials. If you want to look at their fundamentals you can check some other dd like this [one](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/n9ydod\/palantirs_pltr_fundamentals_just_became_even\/). It's about a month old, but it's still incredibly relevant now. This post is meant to address the general question of what PLTR is as a company, what they do, and bring some general attention to the interesting options volume this week.\n\n*This is not financial advice. Do your own research!!! The more research i did in PLTR the more bullish i became.*\n\n# TL;DR\n\n\\- PLTR visualizes abstract data in a meaningful way for any business to easily analyze and efficiently run their business.\n\n\\- PLTR is a modular system that allows for companies to connect with each other seemlessly creating an interconnected community for data to travel which will create waves in how business is conducted.\n\n\\- PLTR is an engineering master piece that is incredibly unique. For anyone to compete with them will be difficult to put it lightly.\n\n\\- PLTR has been sleeping for a while, it's ready for a rally if we can get enough attention due to high Open Interest and low IV.\n\n\\- [Karp is a Giga Chad](https:\/\/encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com\/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQwLx-qpgHrcSU27NjPrIq6LBMCkjMG6HIfjZCcVKRmhQmlyNwx)\n\n# What is Palantir?\n\n\"Palantir is a platform for data analytics and ai\", I've seen this thrown around quite a bit, and honestly wtf does that mean? I'm a programmer and even i don't fucking get it. Well all became clear after the [demo day](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=EFP3sBQfaww) came out, where finally PLTR showcased their platforms which people are sleepin on. Before we can answer what PLTR is, we need to answer \"what is data\"? Data is the logical representation of the real world. Any largescale business will always collect a ton of data most often stored in texts such as spreadsheets or databases (which requires programming knowledge to navigate through). So what does PLTR do with this data? Well they consolidate a company's data and displays it in a comprehensible easily digestible UI for the company to use. (Note that they take company's data, PLTR doesn't gather or store any data of it's own) Easy right? This allows for pretty much any company\/organization like [the CDC for medicine](https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/palantir-to-help-u-s-track-covid-19-vaccines-11603367276), the [military for national security](https:\/\/www.palantir.com\/palantir-gotham\/21-launch\/), and the [stock market for financial fraud](https:\/\/twitter.com\/PalantirTech\/status\/1399747624463486986) (stock market is only rumors for now but hopefully PLTR HELP US FIND THE HEDGIES THAT MANIPULATE THE MARKET) . But how insane is this? Working with that much data is a nightmare. In a society where data is already a necessity, being able to look through and analyze data quickly for any anomalies or patterns is crucial to any company and is often overwhelming. With PLTR a normal non-technical operator can click their computer to pull up an order, or an issue that PLTR detected, make any changes and or notify whoever needs the attention. Let's take the CDC for example. When the vaccine rolled out, PLTR had a huge hand in this. PLTR gives visual display of where the vaccine is going, how many, and any issues that has risen if any, allowing for fast response time. You can imagine PLTR displaying a map with the various routes to different deployment sites with pictures of a little truck representing the shipments being routed to their destination. An operator can click 1 of these shipments\/routes and pull up any data of that specific point. With data being displayed and organized in this way it makes it easy to analyze data, where are things going, what kind of picture does the data represent, rather than staring at a spreadsheet of numbers. Now this is just an example, PLTR is general enough and customizable enough where it can represent any business\/organization's structure. Once data is organized it opens up the possibility for even further opportunities such as creating simulations of potential issues that can happen in order to forsee and plan for various situations. It allows data to be clean enough to train machine learning algorithms (a big problem with ML is that data isn't clean or has weird edge cases that fucks up the model. If you talk to any data\/ml engineer they will typically mention most of their job is cleaning data over actual application). Companies can create scripts or AI to respond to events if needed. It can be as simple as notifying an executive if an issue occurs, or completely issuing a rollback order if there's a sudden spike of side effects for the covid vaccine which will be represented in the data. It's the ultimate data representation\/analysis platform that any company can utilize and it's fucking insane, i still casn't believe PLTR managed to do this. But it brings up a few problems.\n\n# Why Palantir?\n\nWhy can't companies just create their own platform? Because it's expensive, time consuming, and complicated. A common issue large companies have is simply having too much data. Take the automotive industry for example and self driving. Driving data needs to be collected and stored for AI. That's a lot of data... like pentabytes of data if not more.... Now let's say there's data being collected in America, the signs and the messages on side walks, are different than those that are in the UK. If you have a dataset from the UK well that data comes with it's own issues and rules, this creates a problem called \"data silos\" meaning data is separated into it's own little circle separated from other data silos. If the company decides to make a platform to analyze these 2 different types of data, they will have to consolidate, organize, and create 2 kinds of platforms for it. Now this example is only 2, large businesses have dozens of data silos that are often abandoned or isolated. PLTR is a generalized platform that encompasses any and all kinds of data which they themselves work closely with companies in order to cater to what they need. Why can't companies create a general platform themselves? Because it's an engineering nightmare and PLTR is an engineering masterpiece.... It is so insanely difficult to create something general enough to fit any and all data... but PLTR has done exactly that. The best comparison i can correlate this to is computers. Before generalized computers, computers would be built and deployed to do 1 job and 1 job only. Once generalized computers came out it's used everywhere and no company develops their own computer for a single job, they go out and buy a computer, in this case, any company that manages data can benefit from PLTR.\n\nAnother benefit we see from PLTR is that PLTR is 1 huge modular system. If a person from 1 company wants to share data with another company that utilizes PLTR they can do so seemlessly. PLTR talks with each other and easily sends data to and from. Imagine if hospitals or universities adapted this system. You no longer have to manually print a transcript and submit it to the other university's administration and then wait for it to be processed for a few days. If your medical records are stored in 1 hospital and you get sent to the ER in another hospital, your main hospital can send your medical records to the ER you're at seemlessly and quickly. Its insane how misunderstood PLTR is, but it's a far reaching company that will dig into the roots of all whether you jump into it or not, all i'm doing is trying to have it move sooner than later. Deep roots are not reached by the forst.\n\nKarp is a giga chad. Fucking guy got the intelligence of Elon Musk if not more, and the hair to fucking prove it. If you want to witness it first hand, listen to some of his[interviews](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=hjjHdys2Ph4). A lot of his philosophies are amazing and I believe in his abilities to make PLTR go to the moon. \ud83c\udf11\ud83c\udf11\ud83c\udf11\n\nIf anyone's worried that the military may drop PLTR, [here ya go](https:\/\/www.defensenews.com\/land\/2019\/03\/29\/palantir-who-successfully-sued-the-army-just-won-a-major-army-contract\/).\n\n# Why now?\n\nI did a DD on AMC a week ago calling the rally from $20 -> $70. Will the same happen with PLTR? **It can** but it'll need some help. Not gonna explain how the squeeze works as it's beyond the scope of this post. If you want check out the [DD i did on AMC](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/nqa5x8\/why_amc_is_rallying_and_why_it_will_continue\/), i explain the idea there.\n\n[PLTR Option Chain from Yahoo Finance](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/e10egiyiac571.png?width=1363&format=png&auto=webp&s=db92a97940da7189c65e524fe3e6595c70eb638e)\n\nfucking options volume is even higher than AMC when i did AMC's DD. Now PLTR has a larger market cap than AMC so we probably won't see a run up as large as AMC but it's still a great stock with great opportunity. If we can get enough people to get on PLTR it can definitely pop. The options volume is spread out very nicely through the 20-30 range which is perfect for launching the price forward. Meme stocks typically has a second coming. GME had a 2nd wind, BB had a 2nd wind, AMC's 2nd wind is nuttier than it's first one ffs, it looks like it's about time for PLTR to have it's 2nd wind, but it needs more attention.\n\n# Why not AMC\/GME\/BB\/etc?\n\n**I love memes and have made a lot of money off memes.** As much as I love AMC and GME, I sold at the top. I sold AMC at 70, and i sold GME at 400. Why? **Because Meme stocks need to cool down**. This isn't because of hedgies or any kind of attacks. Stocks that are very volatile causes their options to be ridiculously expensive, which prevents the potential for a rally from happening because it's much harder for people to buy in options. Ultimately I don't want to be a bag holder, and i don't want others to be bag holding (rip GME 400$ holders and AMC 70$ holders). Everyone should look for selling opportunities, for GME it was RH closing down and AMC was when the rally ran it's course. (Check the AMC DD above if you need proof, i updated the post as soon as i sold at $70. GME unfortunately I have no proof for) I will still look for opportunities to buy into GME\/AMC again once it's cooled down a bit but for now, PLTR is really cheap, volatility is really low, and we're sitting at the floor right now with huge potential for it to explode. People have been burnt before when PLTR was cooling off from the past, but now **the second coming is near....** We're at the floor right now so if the narrative doesn't play out it's also just a great stock to hold.\n\n# Reversal\/Exit\n\nUnfortunately PLTR doesn't have the same attention as AMC did when i wrote the last DD, so in order for it to pop off this week PLTR will need some love. Even if not enough people realizes how amazing it actually is then it'll just sit steady and grow over time. For PLTR i don't really have an exit. If it does rally i will sell and let it cool, but i'll update this post if that happens. If that doesn't ever happen, then i'll just keep PLTR as a long term hold, and re-allocate funds to riskier plays based on my risk tolerance and when opportunity arises. Other than that I'm more than happy to hold PLTR for years to come. PLTR already has pretty much everything i own right now... All my money, my commitment, my wife... o\\_o PLTR is my wife's boyfriend.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Position**:\n\n4250 shares at $23.32\n\n40x $27 calls 7\/9\n\n10x $30 calls 7\/9\n\n(I do think PLTR will moon sooner, sometime within the week with enough attention but I don't want to get dicked by Theta so i bought calls a bit further out.

Same shit for palantir and a few other really popular growths. Sofi so far has been the most egregious offender as the float should be around 30% shorted total for a really good company. \n\nIt\u2019s really bizarre to see all these decent companies shorted into the ground. One thing I\u2019ve seen is that iwm and related russell etfs have been similarly shorted. Basically any etf containing amc or Gme has been shorted to oblivion in the same manner.

WallStBets know that if they let GME drop, from this spot here, the entire meme frenzy will die. This is 100% the next rip. Also, I absolutely hate fundamentals but this isn't a play based on that, but rather based on the momentum. Old heads don't see that and are still buying shares of the DOW on their quotrons.\n\nNow, let's look at the technicals. Here's where shit gets interesting...\n\n**PRICE ACTION** First off, we need to analyze the price action of GME and right off the bat we see a MASSIVE gap right at $305. Short sellers came in right at the $350 mark and beat it down because if it blew the top off this daily resistance at $326-350, we will absolutely moonshot to $400+. That is if however we transition from these irrelevant CLOV and BB stocks and roll over our gains into GME.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/jpo9521b6o471.png?width=1048&format=png&auto=webp&s=87f7400664a94226b38f8a05473aedfa4c5732b2\n\nAlso, RSI starting to taper. Historically GME has sold off after every earnings call for the past two years so I'm not surprised to see a dip right here. The thing is however that GME absolutely crushed earnings. The previous gap at $210 just filled and we needed that in order to make a higher low.\n\n**FIBS** This spot right here is the single greatest Fib retracement I have ever seen. Hovering right at .618 otherwise known as the \"Golden Trade\". The support level we are bouncing off is in line with the fib levels almost to a T, so we can expect a reversal is coming.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/lzanblgd6o471.png?width=2966&format=png&auto=webp&s=00a00856592e36dd8117faeec6d5d2defc56a5f6\n\n**OPTION VOL** Now the icing on the cake is the option volatility that is absolutely sky rocketing. You can see the slight dip in call vol when we had the fat dip and see it start to pick up when we hit the golden fib ratio and set the gap at 310. Let's also look at the put volatility which has been linear. This is due to the Hedge Funds shorting the fuck out of this stock doing everything they can not to let the redditors and tards win. Options contracts are expiring on friday and are being rolled over, so on monday we will see a new wave of price fluctuation and option pricing where the contracts for next week will begin to drop. If my theory is correct, more buyers will jump in at the cheaper call prices when GME is pumped on market open on monday when it starts looking to fill the $310 gap.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ddyujvsf6o471.png?width=3554&format=png&auto=webp&s=61100491a89df316ba04aa8814d94fe9c1695138\n\n**PC RATIO** Put call ratios look overall bullish and this call option right here stands out. a $4,000,000 call in July? That's big money and while these big institutions are shorting, the smaller guys and smaller firms are pouring money in. You can see that there are a couple of multi-million dollar call spreads and naked calls. The problem here is that your average tard doesn't have $3000+ for a naked call so that's why cheaper contracts will fill the gap.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/d33w9csi6o471.png?width=3554&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6a5cfbbd65b91f320a5577194e229b049ca6d48\n\nIf you believe in the technical analysis and the fuck fundamentals revolution of stocks happening right now, this could be the biggest trade of the year. WallStBets is an organization that I believe will not go down without a fight, and I see them planning a massive rally with GME through their instagram and twitter pages. What you apes don't understand is that there is a hierarchy to everything, and the organizers of WallStBets are absolutely BANKING on the shit that is ripping. A lot of the retards buying can barely navigate this subreddit and see \"BUY GME CANNOT GO TITS UP\" on the front page and just let er rip with a $500 call on their Robinhood account expiring next week. At the end of the day, do your own due diligence. The stock is cheap right now and I'm definitely buying. I believe in WallStBets and I think this is only the beginning of the meme stock revolution, and that these events will be engraved in financial history. This cannot go tits up ;) Not financial advice don't wanna get sued. I'm gonna go back to eating crayons now since my lunch at Arby's is almost over.","797":"$CLOV to the moon!

So don\u2019t fucking follow it, you fucking donkey!

WSB loves triangles, and this love has a fair justification. Triangles incarcerate the flattening of the price action accompanied by diminishing volatility - for the price action subsequently to make a fucking explosion, should the triangle be broken out. The perfect example of that is AMC\u2019s price action after the breakout. \\[Juicy is what juicy does\\]([https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/nfaizr\/amc\\_looking\\_juicy\\_next\\_resistance\\_targets\\_1623\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/nfaizr\/amc_looking_juicy_next_resistance_targets_1623\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)), what else can I say.\n\nAs you may observe, GME has a very similar triangular technical formation at its core, which has been broken out in a similar to AMC nature. Since the two stonks are short squeeze brothers in arms (...Dire Straits starts playing) and have been moving according to linear correlation for a considerable period of time, imho, it\u2019s fair to assume that GME should catch its brother in arms up at some point in the near future, and this is the main assumption that I base my thesis on. \n\nSo far so good, now take a look at those Fibo levels: the AMC retracement is applied from Jan apex (premarket 4h chart high, looks like a gap on daily) to the subsequent low during the local accumulation phase. Thereafter, the following extended Fibo levels are highlighted and are of the prior significance for the price action: 1.414, 2, 2.618, 3.272. Those same levels are used to identify the potential GME crucial resistances, and Fibo is applied accordingly.\n\nAnother thing that supports the thesis of GME AMC-rocket-like movement is magenta highlighted patterns on MACD, which look like fucking twins on the two stonks.\n\nAnd the last but not least, take a look at this fascinating momentum visualisation: True Strength Indicator. AMC looks a bit exhausted, while GME has a lot of potential unrealised upside steam under the hood (fat magenta rectangle).\n\nOverall, the TA picture for GME looks nice and juicy to me, what do you think?\n\nLove you and fuck you with all of my heart,\n\nRoman, aka TA degenerate.\n\nOh, and this is a closeup of the price action after the breakout. *Thinking of a spot on metaphor...* The things look as similar as my left and right testicle:\n\n[AMC](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/3fgyr3zhah471.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a4701c608c386223824d143c9e254d858894db33)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[GME](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/sxymaf3kah471.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f876de00fb46e79f783756ab5bd7b0fe6f41f0f3)","800":"There was no overvote, trimming, etc. I'm seeing a lot of misinformation claiming that there was an overvote with GME  and the results were  \"trimmed\" or \"normalized\".

Here I'm going to present you my unified theory of retardation, or the UTR for short.\n\nThis theory attempts to explain the movement of all the meme stocks rising together, regardless if they have real squeeze potential or not. Notables include $BB, $RKT, $BBBY, $NOK, $CLNE, $WKHS, $WISH, $CLF, etc...\n\n**Theory**\n\nThe world watched the some of above mentioned stocks pump through the roof in January for presumably no reason according to fundamentalists, the only explanation given was that something called Gamestop was squeezing because of something called naked shorts and a cat was involved. Now here we are 6 months later and the media is saying the same stuff, like \"reddit is at it again\" and \"meme stocks are up 300%\". So if you were a boomer hearing that on CNBC wouldn't you put 1 and 1 together and realize you can profit from this? You would probably look up what reddit previously pumped and FOMO hard into whichever meme stock hasn't quadrupled yet? Why not, seems to be a foolproof plan.

But Gerko thinks the reality is the opposite. \u201cIf you think of zero commissions, on paper it sounds great \u2014 trading was expensive and now it\u2019s free. That\u2019s obviously complete nonsense,\u201d he said.\n\nPart of the allure of retail platforms such as Robinhood is that they provide zero-commission trading. But Gerko said charges are hidden in the difference between the buy and sell price, the so-called spread, meaning brokers and market makers want clients to trade shares where this gap is widest, such as in illiquid stocks that are generally thinly traded.\n\n\u201cIf a market maker earns a certain spread from retail flow, and then pays some percentage of that spread to the retail broker\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009you end up with a perverse incentive to ensure that the end clients trade stocks with very wide spreads,\u201d he said.\n\nThe 41-year-old mathematician\u2019s criticism comes as shares in cinema chain AMC Entertainment and other meme stocks, popular with retail investors in online forums such as Reddit, are soaring once again. AMC shares have jumped by more than 500 per cent in the past month to last week\u2019s highs before moderating, gaining a further boost after the company promised retail investors additional perks \u2014 including free popcorn.\n\n\nGerko said brokerages and other intermediaries are among the beneficiaries of these share price pops, particularly as retail brokers often sell their clients\u2019 trades in bulk on to market makers, which then aim to secure favourable prices for clients. This practice, known as \u201cpayment for order flow\u201d (PFOF), earned US brokers $2.9bn in 2020 without charging amateur investors commission up front, and has attracted attention from regulators.\n\n\u201cIn the current ecosystem there is somehow enough\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. [to] leave market makers with billions of dollars of revenue,\u201d he said. \u201cSo where does this money come from? The retail investors. When people are claiming that they provided X billion dollars of price improvement last year, the question is whether any of that price improvement is real. And whether it\u2019s something they should be proud of.\u201d\n\nThe Russian-born UK citizen started his career as a currencies trader at Deutsche Bank. In 2015, he set up XTX Markets and built one of the largest computer-driven trading firms in the world. He has kept a low profile while amassing more wealth than some household names. Last year he contributed more to the UK\u2019s tax coffers than the Duke of Westminster, according to the Sunday Times, making him the 13th largest individual taxpayer in the country.\n\nHis firm does not employ human traders but relies purely on computer models to buy and sell assets in a bid to generate profits. It does not engage in payment for order flow. The firm is the third largest dealer in global currency markets and handles 13 per cent of European equities traded on exchanges. Since 2019, the company has also been in US stock markets.\n\nA recent paper from consultancy BestX Research said price improvement on retail market orders averages about 25 per cent, compared with the standard benchmark. But the paper added that this in reality was \u201cakin to getting a 30 per cent discount on an item after the shopkeeper raises the price by 40 per cent,\u201d because the benchmark covers only a small slice of the market.\n\nBroker Robinhood and the two of the largest US market makers, Citadel and Virtu, have defended the PFOF model, arguing there is no evidence that payment for order flow harms investors. But newly sworn-in chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Gary Gensler, has said he would make the PFOF model a focus of future work.\n\nGerko said one solution could be to strip PFOF out of the process, and instead to feed retail traders\u2019 orders on to exchanges where they would match off against each other or market makers would compete to execute the deals. He also bats away criticism that his proposals are self-serving, noting that XTX advocates for market structure changes in all markets, even where they play a dominant role already, such as currency markets.\n\nEven with those kinds of changes, however, he doubts that retail investors can emerge victorious from another round of battle with sophisticated trading firms. \u201cRetail investors have managed to cause some pain to one hedge fund. I can assure you in the long run it won\u2019t be retail participants winning this game, that\u2019s just impossible.\u201d\n\nSource: Retail frenzy reflects \u2018broken\u2019 US equity markets, says XTX\u2019s Gerko https:\/\/on.ft.com\/3cq2h3u \n\nFree to read","809":"Motley Fool recent article According to Motley Fool latest article - written by Rich Smith.  \n\n\"Short interest in Express, BlackBerry, and Genius Brands is less extreme, but still elevated:\n\n* Express -- 7% of both shares outstanding and shares floated;\n* BlackBerry -- 9% of shares outstanding and 10% of the float; and\n* Genius Brands -- 14% of shares outstanding and 15% of the float\"\n\n [Why BlackBerry, Express, Genius Brands, and GameStop Stocks Are All Rocking Today (msn.com)](https:\/\/www.msn.com\/en-us\/money\/topstocks\/why-blackberry-express-genius-brands-and-gamestop-stocks-are-all-rocking-today\/ar-AAKNDrj?ocid=msedgntp) \n\nI wonder what you all think about BlackBerry future ahead of their potential new an approved phones?","810":"BB vs GME observation This may be an obvious observation, but looking at the 5 day charts of BB and GME, it looks like they are in total lock-step with each other.

The Canada based, US listed company has been riding a wave of good news. It has made agreements to export its products to Europe, and is set to merge with Aphria to create the largest cannabis company. No wonder it has drawn attention from both hedge funds and private investors on r\/wallstreetbets.\n\n\nSince December 2020, when the merger announcement was first made, Tilray\u2019s share price has jumped around 400%, while Aphria has grown 243%. Other companies are also riding this wave: Canopy Growth\u2019s shares have doubled, and so has ETFMG Alternative Harvest, a fund tracking cannabis stocks all over the world.\n\n\nSince Wednesday 10th February, Reddit Day traders have started showing a lot of interest in cannabis stocks. Both Tilray and Aphria have seen sudden spikes in demand, and their share prices increased 21% and 10% respectively. However, just like Gamestop, this interest was short lived.\n\n\nOn the other hand, short interest in Cannabis stocks is also high. According to Reuters, approximately 37% of Tilray\u2019s free float (shares which are being actively traded in the market) is currently loaned out to hedge funds, up from 27.3% in January.\n\n\nHedge funds are also quite familiar with cannabis companies. For example, in 2018, Tilray\u2019s price skyrocketed from $20 to $300 in the three months following legalization, and forced short sellers to hastily cover their positions by buying stocks (which were also not quite readily available for purchase). \n\n\nNonetheless, according to Yahoo Finance, right now,  there is an approximately 51% short interest in Cannabis stocks by hedge funds and institutional investors. \n\n\nThe only question remains is this, will the Reddit Effect make Tilray and Aphria the new Gamestop?\n\n\nSource : You can read more detail in [this article](https:\/\/buymyweedonline.com\/marijuana\/how-the-reddit-effect-has-impacted-cannabis-stocks\/)","813":"Degenerate Story Time (trials and tribulations of a retard) So since we\u2019re rolling into the weekend I figured this would be a good time to learn a little about the journey some of us have been on the past year or so. I\u2019m sure everyone has a unique personal story of their financial journey throughout this past year or so. I\u2019d love to hear some of the fucking disasters you bulls\/bears\/apes have gotten yourself into as well as the successes. I\u2019m sure mine is mildly entertaining compared to many but I\u2019ll start us off. \n\nOriginally started investing in 2019. I sold all of my positions before the Covid crash last spring (only trading stocks, was up over 100% on my portfolio in approx 6 months which I know is peanuts compared to the gains many have but I was proud of myself for just starting out and mostly swing trading boomer shit) which turned out to be an amazing decision except for the fact that I did not reinvest any of it during the massive March dip. Like many I was stuck in a whirlwind of uncertainty and did not know if society would ever return to normal. So I did the rational thing you would do with your gains. I spent it on drugs and alcohol, and paid off my car note so I could trade my Acura in for my dream car. I bought an Audi s8 which is a car I wanted since I was a teenager. It was fucking amazing, I couldn\u2019t believe it was mine (the banks) and I got to drive that shit around every day. I swear to god I will hit 100mph every single time I got behind the wheel of that car. Even if it was just to run a couple miles up the road to the gas station. My car note was insane, between the payment and my insurance I was paying as much to have that car as I was for my rent each month. It took up a big portion of my disposable income so I stayed away from investing until about August of 2020. I took what was left in my savings account after all those bad decisions and decided once again to jump back into the market. The September tech stock crash pretty much wiped me out and I cut my losses and walked away with a fraction of the money I started with. The next month I crashed the shit out of my Audi. She had no chance with me as the owner. This turned out to be a blessing in disguise because guess what boys, I can now take all the money I was putting into my car (which was waaaaaay out of my league by the way) and invest it. I came up with a monthly budget and by Nov 2020 I was back in the trading game. I spent literally hours each day researching and learning as much as I could. I figured out my swing trading style, had a solid game plan going into each trade, and was making bank. Bank for me anyways. All through Nov and Dec I was making more money swing trading stocks each day than I do at my full time job. I felt like Warren fucking Buffet. \n\n*GME enters stage left\n\nJanuary. Mothering fucking January. Over the course of the couple months prior I had built up a nice little chunk of change for myself and had a portfolio to be proud of. This is when I decided to yolo on GME. Did I buy at $10 or $20, or even $30? No, of course fucking not. I started buying that shit in the $70s and before you knew it I had a triple digit average and had unrealized daily profit that exceeded what I make in a month at work. Oh, BB and AMC are squeezing this month too? Sure I\u2019ll take some of those. Fast forward about a week and I\u2019m selling at a loss and have less money than I had started with in November. I could have secured profits but no. A week of investing in GME had erased all of my fundamentals and made me abhor the color green apparently. Here I am five months later and I\u2019ve barely clawed my way back to breaking even on the cash I initially invested. \n\nDid I swear off meme stocks after this cataclysmic failure of investing? You bet your ass I did. Did I try to swing trade GME again a couple weeks later with some fresh powder and lose even more money? You should know the answer to that at this point. Despite my constant tribulations did I once again buy AMC and BB this week? Of course I did you sexy animal. So here I stand before you today, a full on retard that barely learns from his mistakes. I\u2019d love to hear some of y\u2019all\u2019s investing stories from the past year.  \ud83d\ude18","814":"Ape wonders about AMC,GME and BB advertising budget \ud83d\ude49\ud83d\ude80 SpaceX This ape here was thinking about the meme of Elon having $GME painted on the side of the next SpaceX rocket to be launched.(Which he never said btw.)\n\nBut does SpaceX legitimatly offer advertising services?

AND he explains how there is the possibility that AMC is being used by hedgefucks to hedge their GME losses.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThis post is focused on u\/Criand's DD, which enlightened me and many others as to what the fuck has been going on with the 21 day \/ 31 day FTD cycles.\n\nBasically his DD over the last few weeks is the most accurate hypothesis that we have to date regarding the FTD cycles, and one of his most recent posts shows how this theory is now supported by the price action seen on May 25th and in the following days.\n\nKey Points:\n\n* He clarifies the confusion around why the standalone T+21 day FTD cycles, which have been shown to cause price surges, do not act the same way as they did during the $480 run and the $350 run.\n* Explains how the Feb-March $350 run was caused by a dual event of T+35 & T+21 day FTD cycles occurring in close proximity to one another (back to back trading days)\n* Notes that the Feb 24th initiation of the run up to $350 was exactly 10 days before we peaked at $350\n* He references u\/yelyah2 DD, which shows how gamma neutral spikes on day 1 of the $480 and $350 price run ups, returns to normal for about a week, and then spikes up massively again, initiating the January and February Gamma Squeezes\n\nBelow is my furtherment of u\/Criand's work all in one concise graphic which feels oddly like a child to me right now.  Not sure if that is just because I have not really written any DD's before.\n\nPlease click the image to view it blown up and actually take in what is being laid out for you with my lovely computer crayons which I swear to god I don't eat... EVER.\n\n[Transparent boxes represent the initiation of the combined T+35 \\\/ T+21 day price movements + 6 days \\(because it has only been 6 trading days since ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/v8tmo6hdi5371.png?width=1287&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a7e70813852641f29b2e57d8fc64ea7f7b83f77)\n\nNotes:\n\n* I am not sure why I called the $480 and $350 price run ups in the visual \"Micro Squeezes\", but thats what came to mind.  Perhaps gamma squeeze is more appropriate given u\/yelyah2 recent DD?\n* Yellow is micro squeeze 1\n* Blue is micro squeeze 2\n* Pink is the past 6 days\n\nAlright folks.  I have talked a lot about other peoples work, and given you a graphic.  Now comes my value add.\n\nKey observations:\n\n* Not only was it a 10 trading day ramp up from the February 24th initiation to $350 on March 10th, but it was also **EXACTLY 10 TRADING DAYS** between the January 13th initiation to the $480 peak on January 29th.  My reason for calling this out specifically is that it strengthens the theory surrounding the combined T+35\/T+21 day price movements, and helps us further establish that we could potentially go **PARABOLIC AGAIN 10 trading days from 5\/25 on JUNE 9th.**  Will they be able to stop us this time?  Maybe it doesn't even matter if the do... See my next points\n* In the aftermath of the January \"micro squeeze\" the Dec-Jan price floor of \\~$20 **DOUBLED**, and the new price floor was set at \\~$40 between Feb 5th - 25th.     In the aftermath of the Feb 24th - Mar 10th \"micro squeeze\" the price floor of \\~$40 **TRIPLED**, and the new price floor was set at \\~$120 between Feb 5-25.  Given that the price floor doubled and then tripled after these two events, **could we be expecting the new price floor of more than 3X $120?** (That would be a price floor of $360+ for those of you who needed help there)\n* Edit to previous bullet: someone makes a fair point that \"We can\u2019t assume that since it doubled in January from $20 to $40 and tripled in March from $40 to $120 that therefore the next floor must be more than 3x $120. What if the rule in the sequence is +20->+80->+140? Or what if +20->+80->+20->+80?\"  I have included this just to explicitly state that my question **\"could we be expecting the new price floor of more than 3X $120?\"** by no means is intended to say the price floor WILL triple again.  I feel like this is a good point to say that this is speculation and theorization based on observation and nothing more.\n* The MACD line has literally only had significant crossovers (golden cross) 3 times this year.\n   * Event 1, Yellow ($480 run)\n   * Event 2, Blue ($350 run)\n   * Event 3, Pink (May 17th - today)\n\nAdditionally, I have plotted trend lines for each of the events.\n\n* Event 1 (Yellow) we saw a 10 day increase of roughly 1,733%\n* Event 2 (Blue) we saw a 10 day increase of roughly 770%.\n* 770 \/ 1733 = 44% or a 56% reduction in 10 day price increase, although the price was starting from a floor of $40 instead of $20.\n* 44% of 770% would be 338% starting from $120 which would mean a peak price of \\~$405 in event 3, **IF** this short pattern continues exactly the same.\n* THIS PATTERN WILL NOT CONTINUE EXACTLY THE SAME.\n* I am only observing the trend of the current pattern.  The sample size here is literally 2 events, albeit 2 very unlikely \"coincidental\" events.  And I don't believe in coincidence.\n* The pattern will break for many reasons, but the main reason is that hedge fund manipulation literally cannot continue forever.\n* Once they get margin called its off to the races, and hopefully this event is the straw that quite literally breaks the camels back (Kenny G, you are the camel)\n\nOh yeah... forgot about this one.  LOOK AT THE VOLUME.  ITS LITERALLY FUCKING INSANE.  MEDIA IS PUSHING AMC, KOSS, ANYTHING OTHER THAN GME AND YET IT HAS RUN UP FROM $132 (April 13th) TO $290 WITHOUT A SINGLE TRADING DAY VOLUME GREATER THAN 21 MILLION.  WE SAW VOLUMES OF MORE THAN 150 MILLION IN JANUARY!\n\nAlright guys.  To summarize.  We could be looking at going parabolic again on June 9th based on the pattern identified by the authors I mentioned above.  The price action and technical signals are bullish as fuck.\n\n**This is not my original post**","816":"Does Anyone Else Find It Odd? Everytime Gme starts to squeeze again, all of the sudden all of these other \"meme stocks\" start trending and being promoted as the next short squeeze candidate. Amc, BB, Nio, etc. I can't prove it, and maybe I'm just retarded, but I feel like maybe it's a divide and conquer type deal. It's a lot easier for hedge funds to stave off a massive squeeze, if everyone is putting their money into other stocks instead of concentrating on the one that got us all here. Maybe they're using other meme stocks as a hedge against GME. Like buying calls on stocks like AMC, and then promoting them as the next GME, then when everyone buys into AMC or whatever the new hot stock is, they then have more money to cover their shorts on GME. I know it's a crazy theory, but it just seems odd that everytime the squeeze is initiated, all of the sudden there are numerous other \"squeeze candidate stocks.\"","817":"WKHS is the most heavily shorted stock, 6\/3\/21 Workhorse Group (WKHS) As of today, it is shorted at nearly 42% of float. This seems to me to be the next runner from AMC and GME. \n\nBoth GME and AMC were hugely shorted previously when the rallies started, and now that short interest has decreased. It still is there but has decreased and that's why I think we've seen momentum change.\n\nToday, AMC took a massive hit due to the company offering nearly 12 million stocks for purchase which hurt many peoples wins and likely some that hasn't invested sooner. \nEdit: this above paragraph apparently is inaccurate, it was misinformation posted on a news article today that was misleading. Apparently there was no selloff.\nEdit 2: renig here. Apparently it is confirmed that the 11.5millipn shares were selling today, which naturally would've contributed to the amc sell off. Multiple news outlets I've found state the same not referencing any April date. This is a discussion post. This is the most up to date and accurate info I can seem to find.\n\nI expect GME and AMC will likely both continue to increase if stocks are held. But based on short interest alone, it would seem to me that WKHS is next in line for the biggest squeeze meaning it has the biggest short term gains to be had.\n\nWKHS was trading for around $10-$11 yesterday and is nearly $15\/share currently.\n\nThoughts?","818":"Another $GME, $AMC, $BB aimed for the MOON All right, listen up you fucking idiots. Here's some dd that this dumpster fire of a sub doesn't even deserve. You're making money right now on $GME, $AMC, $BB, or whatever. Allow me to introduce you to a company with boomer level fundamentals that took a haircut during the pandemic and is set to fucking explode. \n\n\nThe company name is Tellurian, ticker is $TELL.\n\n\n--------MY KNOWLEDGE AND BACKGROUND----------\n\nEven though I have a double digit IQ, I am in charge of keeping energy producers from blowing up, spilling fuck loads of oil, catching shit on fire, and\/or keeping seafood fresh and hydrocarbon free. I've been in the business for many moons. I have dealt with MANY companies. I\u2019ve seen MANY business types, I have seen transitions in business models as producers have dealt with energy price crashes. I work directly with company executives all the way down to operators and hands. I like talking to everyone and absorbing as much knowledge as I can, even though I\u2019m mentally retarded.\n\nEven though you morons can\u2019t read, have your wife\u2019s\/gf\u2019s boyfriend read this to you and DRILL it in your fucking smooth brain: LIQUID NATURAL GAS (LNG) DEMAND IS RISING AND WILL CONTINUE TO RISE FOR THE NEXT DECADE (\u201cdEcAde\u201d is a period of ten years for you single digit IQ fucks) AND BEYOND. LNG will be the \u201ctransition\u201d fuel between dirtier energy sources and \"green\" energy. This transition is coming sooner than we think. \n\n\nAre you following?\n\n\nWhat's this LNG, you might ask. You need to liquefy gas (basically \u201cconcentrating\u201d it) so that it becomes economical to ship overseas. Overseas markets for LNG is massive and growing. Seriously look it up, EU, China, and others are increasingly relying on the stuff. It\u2019s much more expensive for them to produce than the US.\n\nWhen a producer (the company that puts together millions of dollars to drill a well) drills for oil, if your drill and zone prediction (a \u201czone\u201d is the area that a geologist, paid for by the producer, finds to contain oil) is correct, 99% of the time, three products will flow to the earth\u2019s surface in your process. These three are water, oil, and NATURAL GAS. Producers will separate oil and water dispose of this waste water into a disposal well thousands and thousands of feet deep. Producers will then sell the oil.\u2026 What happens to the gas?? Well, if the producer is lucky, there will be a pipeline within a mile or two of their well. They will have to pay WAY over 200K to 500K just welding a mile of gas pipeline to tie into this sales line then pay 100 to 250K for a LACT unit. This is why oilfield welders have fewer IQs than I do but make $150\/hr, depending upon pipeline wall thickness (dependent upon flowing pressures and how safe the producer wants to be if not bound by DOT regulations)\n\nIf these costs aren\u2019t too high, and the well is producing as much product as expected, then great, they sell gas. However, if they're producing less oil than predicted, or they're producing thousand of barrels of water per day, their disposal costs will be so high, they can\u2019t afford to build the pipeline, they will just burn the stuff. Seriously, I can not tell you HOW MUCH GAS IS JUST BURNED. The VAST majority of producers just \u201cflare\u201d the gas. Just the \u201cflare\u201d vessel is like $30K. Imaging paying $30K to burn LNG that's worth 100s of thousands of dollars. I worked in the Permian basin in West Texas. Anyone here with this experience can vouch for me. At night, in the Permian, the sky is literally lit up with these flares. It\u2019s like you're a goddamn ant on a fucking birthday cake that\u2019s for both for your great great great mothers and her boyfriend\u2019s birthday (basically a shit load of candles). It\u2019s an amazing sight.\n\n\u00ad---------wWhY dO tHeY DoO WasTE gAAS??------------------\n\nYou\u2019re in the middle of fucking NOWHERE. You\u2019d have to run hundreds of miles of pipeline to sell the gas. This would cost more than drilling the well. No company in their right mind would do this. The only options is to flare it. This one company I was working for was burning over 100K worth of natural gas per MONTH PER WELL, they had FIVE wells. The US just burns the crap, we can produce it so cheap, it just makes more sense to burn it rather than bothering to sell it. Gas is a nuisance to us. Other countries would die for it. There is actually new technologies that converts LNG into GASOLINE for cars. If you\u2019re a stupid brain dead fuck who doesn't believe me, fucking Google it. \n\n\n\n-------So what about this TeLlUriAn coMpaNIee?-----------\n\nCharif Souki started Tellurian. If you don\u2019t know who he is, he is a LNG god. He was a banker on Wall St, highest paid CEO years ago, pioneered the LNG industry. He and his team are impeccable. If you want to build a LNG empire, you hire Souki, if you want to know the future of hydrocarbon energy, you hire Souki, if you want a new boyfriend for your wife, you hire Souki. He built Cheniere Enerny (about 2 hours from my house), a company with $10billion in revenue and is trading $80\/share. \nHe was fired because Carl Ichan was a complete bully. The business was not being built to Soukies vision. Soukie took the best staff members along with him and started Tellurian. Can you imagine their trust in this guy? Leaving an established company to start a new one... LNG business model is requiring a change and Soukie realizes this. It will need to be produced at less cost, current business models aren\u2019t sustainable. Cheniere Energy is over 20 BILLION dollars in debt. Yes, $20 BILLIOOONNNNNNNN. Guess how much debt Tellurian has? ZERO, NONE, $0.00. This is UNHEARD of in a new company in this industry. \n\nTellurian just signed a 10 BILLION dollar purchase agreement from ONE company. TELL is currently talking deals with at least 4 other companies. This 10 billion dollar deal is a 10 year agreement. This is 1 billion per year. Their current market cap is just over 1 billion. Do you realize yet how undervalued this company is?? It\u2019s mind blowing. They begin their Driftwood facility construction in Louisiana this summer. This will be the terminal to export LNG, 32 billion dollar project.\n\nDo you know whats even better?? They wont completely rely on third party producers selling them gas to liquefy, BECAUSE THEY DRILL AND PRODUCE THEIR OWN GAS. They started drilling again after a brief pause due to covid-19. We pay for monthly reports of all producers who receive state permits for drilling. Just this month Tellurian has TWO permits.\n\nSouki uploads regularly to YouTube (seriously what other major high level executive does this??), he was on Jim Cramers show multiple times, Jim Cramer was always contrary to Souki\u2019s predictions, and SOUKI ALWAYS turned out RIGHT. Look it up, these are Jim Crammer\u2019s words, NOT mine. Just a day or two ago, Souki said in his YouTube video \u201cwe are preparing for the ride of a lifetime.\u201d I assume this is his way of telling us \u201cbuy in now you fucking retards\u201d without being fined by the SEC.\n\n------------HOW is ThiS LIKE GME, AMC, BB?-----------------\n\nTHE SHORT POSITIONS OMG YOU SHOULD KNOW THIS BY NOW. IT\u2019S 17%!! Most of these positions were taken out at pandemic start. The joke is on them, Tellurian paid off their debts during their worst time HAHAHAHAHA. There WILL be a short squeeze. These shorts have no fucking clue about this dream team, the true depth of industry, and future of LNG production. \n\n\n---------------------hOw MuchH CanI MAKe?---------------------\n\nAt the VERY VERY least, I\u2019m betting we run to pandemic level of $10-11\/share (REMEMBER THIS WAS BEFORE THEY EVEN SIGNED ANY PURCHASE AGREEMENTS!!!). Calls are still cheap.\n\n\n\n------------------------------PROOFS----------------------------------lll--------\n\nA screenshot of the rig reports showing Tellurian\u2019s activities\u2026..\nhttp:\/\/imgur.com\/gallery\/hw7kJuy\n\n\nTl;dr - undervalued company with no debt and unlimited potential in energy industry with a middleman position to the transition to clean energy WITH SHORT POSITIONS about to lift off.

We definitely have some interesting stocks in the list.\n\n**Virgin Galactic ($SPCE):** \n\n[  ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/6b1p1y39o9271.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f64d87ae205fce62b2be427ecd81638af12b868)\n\nNo points for guessing the top growing stock of the week. Virgin Galactic exploded in mentions due to its SpaceShipTwo craft (pictured above) reaching space. This marked the company\u2019s first flight in more than two years and they expect to launch paying customers as soon as 2022. Wall Street analysts have flip-flopped on their rating first downgrading the stock price by 33% and then upgrading it back to their earlier recommendation (a 50% hike). Overall, the company has already reached the consensus 12-month price target of $31.20 and has risen a cool 25% in the last week.\n\n**Beyond Meat($BYND):** The stock has rallied 28% last week mainly following commentary from CNBC's Jim Cramer. On his Mad Money show, Cramer said the WallStreetBets crowd should make Beyond Meat the next meme stock to drive a short squeeze. He specifically noted that almost 25% of $BYND shares are held short, setting up a scenario for sharp gains. Since Wednesday, there has been a continuous stream of $BYND YOLO\u2019s and DDs across Reddit sparking the rise in the discussion.\n\n**BlackBerry($BB):** shares jumped as much as 12% Wednesday amid cheers from Redditors and a broader rally in meme stocks. One important thing to note here is BlackBerry's short interest still remains below 10% of shares outstanding, meaning any short squeeze wouldn't have too much room to run. [This](https:\/\/investorplace.com\/2021\/05\/blackberry-by-any-other-name-would-have-a-much-higher-valuation\/) article has an interesting theory where they argue that BlackBerry by any other name would have a much higher valuation.\n\n**NVIDIA($NVDA):** announced a stellar quarter with revenue of $5.66 billion, up 84 percent from a year earlier, and Data Center revenue of $2.05 billion, up 79 percent from a year earlier. They are projecting a record $6.3B revenue next quarter. The stock experienced a delayed earnings reaction and has gained 8.4% this week. Considering how hard it was to buy the new NVIDIA product, I don\u2019t expect their revenue growth to plateau anytime soon.\n\n**Sundial Growers($SNDL):** was trending as the stock passed the $1-mark last Friday. For those who are not familiar with the company, it was ridden up from 60 cents to almost $3 within one month last February. With the current rally in stock price and with the price getting over the psychological barrier of $1, interest seems to be picking up.\n\nSOME FAQ\u2019s:\n\n**How does the program work:** The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).\n\n**What is sentiment:** It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also (eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here is the average across all the comments.\n\nThank you for reading!\n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor.*","825":"Why is no one talking about BBBY? I know everyone is all about AMC and GME right now and by all means I have nothing but love for the Apes putting up the fight. I paper handed my AMC shares literally right before this last jump like an idiot. I bring up BBBY because right now it has a higher short percentage of float than both AMC and GME.\n\nAccording to Yahoo Finance as of 5\/14\/2021 the short percentage of float for each of these companies is:\n\nGME - 29.34%\nAMC - 21.13%\nBBBY - 64.38%\n\nBBBY also just announced a partnership with DoorDash to offer same day delivery. The stock jumped on this news. Additionally, BBBY is poised to benefit from restrictions being lifted as a reopening play.\n\nUnfortunately, the analysts don\u2019t have much consensus on the stock. BofA recommends it as a buy with a 12 month target of $38 in a report published on 5\/28\/2021. Morningstar recommends to hold with a target price of $22, but that report was on 4\/21\/2021. I suspect Morningstar will come out with an updated report in the near future. CFRA rates it as a sell with a target price of $16 in a report published on 5\/29\/2021. Seems pretty conservative given that the stock hasn\u2019t been at that level since September of last year. Maybe they have some short interest \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f.\n\nBefore I YOLO a large percentage of my portfolio into some call options, I wanted to get your thoughts\/opinions on the stock to see if I\u2019m missing something.","826":"From March to Friday - Finally Back in March I threw everything I had into AMC after doing countless hours of research.

This has been the longest 3 months of my entire life.\n\nThe crazy thing. This is still the pre-game. The main event is still yet to come. Except this time, I'll be in on GME and AMC. \n\nI know there has been a lot of hate towards AMC. GME was just too expensive for me to make any real traction.\n\nI love me some gamestop. Can't wait till tuesday. Never lose the faith.","827":"Amazon should consider buying Gamestop due to natural synergies between the two business models. Here's my full case. **1: Amazon wants to open up physical stores to sell over-stocked computer equipment from their warehouses. Gamestop has suitable locations for them all across the country to do so.**\n\nAmazon has been looking into this idea even before the pandemic, and delayed its plans because of the pandemic. Essentially, Amazon has a bunch of excess stock of computer equipment in its warehouses that they really just want to get rid of (since it costs money to store). Instead of throwing it out they would prefer to sell it - even at a big discount. This is likely stuff like older graphics cards, monitors, computers etc. This solves a key issue with Gamestop's business model: Gamestop's margin's suck. Selling computer equipment that would have just been thrown out anyway means that every dollar sold is a dollar saved.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's the original news report for anyone who wants more information:\n\n[https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2021-04-01\/amazon-explored-opening-home-goods-electronics-discount-store](https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2021-04-01\/amazon-explored-opening-home-goods-electronics-discount-store)\n\nAnd if you're paywalled out here's a couple others that should do the trick:\n\n[https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/amazon-discussed-discount-electronics-home-goods-stores-report-2021-4](https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/amazon-discussed-discount-electronics-home-goods-stores-report-2021-4)\n\n[https:\/\/www.bnnbloomberg.ca\/amazon-explored-opening-home-goods-electronics-discount-store-1.1585362](https:\/\/www.bnnbloomberg.ca\/amazon-explored-opening-home-goods-electronics-discount-store-1.1585362)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2: A number of ex-Amazon executives already work at Gamestop in the C-Suite**\n\nDue to this - the cultures of the companies are likely to become very similar and people at Amazon and Gamestop are likely to have worked together in the past. This makes any type of business combination much easier\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's a couple (I'm sure you guys can add more to this list): \n\nChief Growth Officer (CGO):  Elliott Wilke \n\nChief Operating Officer (COO):  Jenna Owens\n\nChief Technology Officer (CTO):  Matt Francis\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/gamestop-announces-third-hire-from-amazon-for-executive-team-2021-3](https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/gamestop-announces-third-hire-from-amazon-for-executive-team-2021-3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3: A clean exit from a short selling debacle**\n\nMany people have floated around theories of naked short selling, imaginary shares, etc. No matter if you believe these are correct or not lets make an assumption here that there is something fishy going on. If there is something fishy going on, there's nothing the SEC would like more than to neatly sweep it under the rug. Lets say this fishy thing makes it so that closing all short positions in GameStop would cause the stock price to skyrocket due to a share shortage and pose a serious threat to the entire financial system. Obviously this isn't a great outcome if the financial system fails\n\nHow does Amazon solve this? An all-stock deal. Short sellers go from being short Gamestop to being short Amazon. The number of liquid shares of Amazon is far greater in dollar value than the liquid shares of Gamestop. This means that short sellers would be able to close out of their position without pushing up Amazon's stock price to some ridiculous number\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**4: Amazon has the cash to bankroll and supercharge Gamestop's innovation**\n\nBetween developing NFTs and reinventing their business Gamestop has some challenges ahead of it. To execute on their strategies they will need cash to do so. An Amazon + Gamestop merger is more valuable than Gamestop alone and Amazon alone. Furthermore Amazon could benefit from this Gamestop's NFT technology (think digital rights management solution for all of Amazon's content) and expand its market share in collectables and gaming.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**5: Amazon could use a distraction from news focusing on thwarted worker unionization attempts**\n\nBeing able to shift the news narrative from \"Amazon kills unionization attempts\" to \"Amazon saves \\~50,000 jobs at struggling retailer Gamestop\" seems like an obvious perk of doing this deal\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust a couple recent articles about Amazon:\n\nFrontpage news was made fairly recently as Amazon defeated a unionization attempt\n\n[https:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/economy\/2021\/5\/19\/amazon-plans-for-new-alabama-warehouse-after-us-union-defeat](https:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/economy\/2021\/5\/19\/amazon-plans-for-new-alabama-warehouse-after-us-union-defeat)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA NYT article titled \"How Amazon Crushes Unions\"\n\n[https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2021\/03\/16\/technology\/amazon-unions-virginia.html](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2021\/03\/16\/technology\/amazon-unions-virginia.html)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**6: Jeff Bezos is looking for a new project. Being the biggest champion of GameStop would cement his legacy**\n\nNow that Jeff Bezos is stepping down as CEO of Amazon, he has time to work on new projects. Gamestop sounds like a fun fixer-upper for a billionaire with some extra time on his hands. Furthermore the rivalry between Elon Musk and Bezos has never been greater; their competing space projects (blue origin and spacex) have gone head to head in recent years. Elon has a key advantage that Bezos doesn't though - a die-hard fanbase. Arguably these fans have really powered SpaceX and Tesla's success - as Elon's celebrity status draws in talent and sells product. Bezos, while popular doesn't quite have the same type of energized fans. Buying Gamestop would also buy him an army of WSB apes and close the gap.\n\nElon & Jeff have been rivals for years:\n\n[https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/jeff-bezos-elon-musk-rivalry-history-timeline-2020-7](https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/jeff-bezos-elon-musk-rivalry-history-timeline-2020-7)\n\nPlus, now that he is single he has time to play videogames!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**7: Bootstrapping Amazon's P\/E Ratio**\n\nBuying GameStop would make Amazon look cheaper (in terms of P\/E ratio). As of 5\/28 yahoo finance is showing forward (next 12 months) PE ratios of 54 for Amazon and 37 for Gamestop (price around 220) as of 5\/28\n\nHaving a P\/E ratio of 54 and buying a company with a PE ratio of 37 makes the combined company have a P\/E ratio somewhere between the two. Amazon P\/E ratio going from 54 to less than 54 makes the stock look like a better deal to investors.","828":"AMC & GME Price Action Comparison before their squeeze What's going on y'all\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust want to share some charts and information that I noticed while comparing AMC and GME before the squeeze\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo as you all know, this past week has been one for the books for AMC, from it's low on Monday, May 24th we witnessed an increase of 201% on AMC.

GME's breakout candle, on Thursday, January 13th and AMC's breakout candle, on Wednesday, May 13th are almost identical\n2. After both breakouts, they traded above the bollinger bands for 3 back to back sessions\n3. After GME's breakout, we saw a consolidation of price action for 5 trading sessions\n4. After AMC's breakout we saw a consolidation of price action for 7 trading sessions\n5. From GME's low on it's initial breakout to it's high the Friday before the squeeze, we saw on increase of 283%\n6. From AMC's low on it's initial breakout to it's high the Friday before the potential squeeze, we saw an increase of 245%\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is where things get interesting...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe bullish candle that was formed for GME on Friday, January 22nd looks ALOT like the bullish candle formed on Thursday, May 27th for AMC\n\nThe spinning top candle that was formed for GME on Monday, Jan 25th looks alot like the spinning top candle formed on Friday, May 28th for AMC\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTaking into consideration the market is closed on memorial day, is this history repeating itself? If it is, that would mean the squeeze will start next week? Now I don't want to attach certain dates, I'm just sharing more information with you all.

CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer said Wednesday he\u2019s not sure why any investors are still betting against GameStop and AMC Entertainment, two of the so-called meme stocks popular on Reddit\u2019s WallStreetBets forum.\n.\n.\nThe \u201cMad Money\u201d host made his comments following a session in which GameStop shares rose almost 16% Wednesday and AMC advanced 19%. The stocks are up 37% and more than 60%, respectively, this week alone as the speculative trading that took first Wall Street by storm in January resumed.\n.\n.\n\u201cAnyone shorting AMC or GameStop is out of their mind. ... WallStreetBets is too powerful and trying to bet against them right now is just giving them more ammo,\u201d Cramer said.\n.\n.\nDespite some optimism around a potential turnaround spearheaded by Chewy co-founder Ryan Cohen, Cramer contended the video-game retailer GameStop remains way overvalued. AMC \u2014 which still faces headwinds from the rise of digital streaming \u2014 is also expensive at current levels, Cramer said.\n.\n.\nBut Cramer the companies are not trading based on fundamentals, which makes shorting their stocks dangerous as long as they remain beloved by Reddit traders.\n.\n.\nShorting a stock is essentially a bet that it will fall in price. An investor such as a hedge fund borrows shares and then immediately sells them into the market, with the goal of buying them back later at a lower level. Then, the investor returns the borrowed shares, profiting off the price differential.\n.\n.\nWhen the opposite happens and the stock rises in value, a short-seller may seek to minimize losses by purchasing shares at their higher price.\n.\n.\nBoth GameStop and AMC have over 20% of their float shares sold short, according to data from S3 Partners. That\u2019s compared with an average of 5% short interest in a typical U.S. stock.\n.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this: a group of buyers with no sensitivity to price,\u201d Cramer said. \u201cThese people don\u2019t have unlimited firepower, but they\u2019ve got enough firepower to engineer a short-squeeze any time a bunch of professionals decide to bet against this thing.\u201d\n.\n.\n\u201cThese people don\u2019t have unlimited firepower\u2026\u201d\n.\n.\nI believe Cramer has never met the INTERNET!!!!!!","831":"Daym it feels good to be a GME hodler in times like these!

How do you like this, Wen Moon?  \n\n[GME Daily Chart](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/7f0br59p2i171.jpg?width=2379&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8235e35a004aee7fa7f74e591251a636aa2421ce)\n\nSup, WSB folks!\n\nIt\u2019s Roman here with my Technical ANALysis, remember me?

Btw, the first major resistance there of $16 has been broken already, $20 is the next one and the things are going according to the forecast.\n\nCongrats to AMC hodlers, but today we\u2019ll take a look at the superior stonk\u2018s current TA state, discussing how things might play out in the shorter term perspective.\n\nThe first thing to take a look at this [GME](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/eAxaHhE) chart, is the beautiful Bollinger Bands setup. Bollinger Bands is a powerful TA instrument, used by traders for the purpose of identifying potential support and resistance zones, as well as a trend direction. Furthermore, BB is a helpful tool to work with the volatility, as price action\u2018s fluctuations are taken as a cornerstone measurement for the Bollinger channels. As you should be able to see on the chart, with the volatility in Jan, Feb and Mar the BB channel looks thick (just as your BF\u2019s GF\u2019s ass). Since the beginning of April, though, the consolidation is obvious, and the channel consequently has been narrowing down. But BOOM, the breakout happened yesterday followed by the conformational solidly looking gap today. The setup of a very similar nature crystallized in January too (highlighted blue) and it is easy to see what happened afterwards. Juicy, what else can I say.\n\nMACD. The thing points up, indicating the bullish momentum, with all of the threes indicators (MACD, Signal and Histogram) being on the bullish territory and accelerating with the current price action.\n\nAnd the most important factor to \ud83d\udc3b in mind, resistances. As I mentioned in the title, the Purple Haze ($233) is being tested currently, and to my understanding, this is the most important price level for GME currently (refer to this [post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/nc6qi3\/lets_revive_the_buried_wsb_culture_gme_to\/) for the explanation). As soon as this one is conquered, $350 and $481 seem to be the next two major resistances on the horizon.\n\nI hope, that you enjoyed this little piece of TA, have a great day! \n\n(and compulsory not a fin advise and fuck you!)","832":"What do you guys think of GME??!!

Recently I\u2019ve been working on this fascinating piece of TA, and now I am finally ready to share that with [you](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/msv8n1\/tbh_i_only_trust_retards\/). I am so confident in it, that I dared to put my beard (which I have for five years already) on the line! Worth your full read, I promise! I decided to structure the analysis in the following way: first we'll take a look at the VW short squeeze, revisiting its origins and background as the very first step of the discussion - in order to better understand the fundamental context of TA; after that I'll lay down the main technical parameters and frameworks, through which the [GMESS](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/Sd4uE1b) thesis will be dissected, applying all of those to VWSS and explaining the TA core on the Volkswagen example; then, the process will be repeated, but this time TSLASS anatomy will be elaborated upon. Finally, all of the data accumulated in the process, as well as the major findings made, will be applied to the current technical state of GME, in order to construct at least a potential forecast and the probable price action. Buckle up and eat a crayon, let's start.\n\nOh, and one more thing! I really encourage you to dive deep into the ANALysis with me, because the thesis can only be understood if all of the technical factors at play are considered in the sharpest detail first - and then in the aggregate: zooming out and looking at the bigger picture through the prism of coincidences, interdependences and probabilities. Dafaq did I just write? - Dunno, but that's exactly what I meant!\n\n(Not a financial advice, as I am not a professional advisor, just an amateur ANALyzer)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Volkswagen - Das Short-Squeeze: Sep 2007 - Mar 2009\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRemember, when VW became the most valued company in the world for a brief wild period of trading? I bet, Pepperidge apes remember. The squeeze played out right in the midst of the global financial crisis, and such an occurrence was fueled by a curious background scenario, orchestrated largely by one very interesting person. Back then, the former President of Porsche, Wendelin Wiedeking (must be a cousin of Battlefield Counterstrike), was pursuing a goal of taking over Volkswagen. In this process, he used cash-settled options to circumvent the transparency and disclosure of Porsche\u2019s market operations. While being acquired by Porsche, Volkswagen had its ordinary shares premium risen to disproportionately high levels compared to its preference shares.\n\nAs the general public was finding out about Wendysking\u2019s takeover plan, hedge funds and particularly short-sellers set their eyes on the fact that Volkswagen\u2019s preferred shares were traded at a significant discount to the ordinaries (approximately 70%). While the price of the ordinary stock gradually increased, the preferential shares stayed put - and the hedge funds smelt an arbitrage opportunity. They started shorting the stock and buying the preferred shares to profit on the massive divergence. For a moment, there was no news of Porsche continuing its purchase of VW ordinaries from the market, and that fact gave the hedge funds additional confidence. Only to get blindsided, as it turned out later. One shorts-frying weekend, Porsche announced its total holding in VW, cornering the substantial part of the float, and leaving only 6% in free float. In the meantime, short sales had risen to 12% of total stock outstanding. When the market found out that Porsche had acquired 74.1% of the outstanding shares through the in-transparent cash-settled options, VWSS happened - briefly making Volkswagen the largest company in the world, and finally allowing the shorting side to [GUH](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/dpnzup\/i_recorded_todays_marketopen_and_the_instant\/):\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>It was mathematically impossible for every short-seller to buy a share, and therefore close their position. In other words, half the room were going to be left in a burning building with no way out. A panicked dash for the exit began.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2014 A spot on metaphor by Jamie Powell, an FT journalist. Hedge funds are estimated to have lost $20 to $30 billion by betting against VW ordinary stock.\n\nWhat is really ironic (in Palpatine voice) - even though Porsche managed to burn many short sellers, the company couldn\u2019t pay up for the huge positions it had created, and ended up being acquired by VW instead.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/3w0ajhk1f2z61.jpg?width=1722&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a4d29a8a0c5ccacfdd193f3e2d5100d0cfdee74b\n\nAlso, interestingly enough, after his departure from Porsche, Wiedeking was charged with market manipulation for his role in the takeover bid. The charges were dropped in July 2016 due to a too little chance of success. Lucking Fegend.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Now let\u2019s take a look at how this epic event was incorporated into the chart:**\n\n[VWSS, Daily Chart](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/d3pfzvb202z61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e497ddf6518faec188269120c44df64ab6cb1791)\n\nEven though it all looks overwhelming from the first glance, don't worry, I'll explain. There are only two major TA instruments used here, namely Fibonacci retracement \ud83c\udf08tool (useful for assessing 'altitude' and the crucial support\/resistance levels, check out the in-depth explanation of this TA tool [in my other post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/mwevzz\/the_big_short_20_why_bears_may_soon_reconsider\/)). The second one is the trend based Fibonacci extension for time periods (pink vertical grid with numbers 0, 0.382, 0.618 and so on) - for setting the major time landmarks and zones. Furthermore, you should have noticed the three catchy geometric figures, and the purple line - which is actually a good starting point to unfold the technical thesis.\n\nIn the process of working with VW, TSLA and GME charts, I managed to identify several peculiar characteristics and patterns, that were of an evident nature and have been manifested on all of the three charts, to one degree or another. The most prominent one, in my opinion, is the killer purple resistance\/support level. For the current VW example, it is somewhere around $30 mark, or $29.27 if you like precision.\n\nOne may observe on the chart above, that this level is indeed the most significant level through the complete history of VWSS. First, the preliminary to the squeeze major bull run, which solidly accelerated in the middle of September 2007, was held back and repulsed by this level's resistance on the last day of October. It took almost half a year for the price action to catch up to it again in late March 2008. This was followed by a consolidation (with several failed attempts of breakout) just below this level, which lasted for more than 100 days, before the price action finally torn the resistance apart with the powerful gap on the 16th of July '08. And guess what? Even after that, the level played the major supportive role for the price action, with one final retest before the squeeze finally lift off it in the middle of September 2008. You should also make a note of how the price was still magnetized by this level during the final stages of the squeeze. The signifficance of this price level for the whole chart of VW above is difficult to underestimate. Seeing the importance of this level and being a fan of Jimi Hendrix, I decided to name it \"**Purple Haze**\".\n\nLet's inspect the fancy geometric shapes now. These are actually much more reasoned and circumspective than it may seem from the first glance. The first one, in orange, is a cup shaped consolidation (let it be called the \"**Squeezy Grail**\", because why not?) - taking place above 100% Fibo and just below the 'Purple Haze'  - which commenced as soon as this major resistance level had been tested for the first time. It is subsequently followed by the second consolidation of a flatter nature \\[if you know what else is of a flatter nature, comment and if the joke is good enough I may give you an award\\], which again plays around the main $30 level on the chart. The second consolidation, highlighted by the pink rectangle (a.k.a. the \"**Runway**\"), is actually more important than the first one, because here is the point where the paramount breakout happens: the 'Purple Haze' resistance is blew off (in the middle of 0.382 period). Based on that observation, it is also appropriate to assume that in order for the squeeze to initiate, the 'Purple Haze' has to be conquered at some point inside 0.382 Fibo time zone, during the 'Runway' stage. Finally, the triangular \"**Squieezluminati Confirmed**\" part is self explanatory, imho. Oh, just one commentary worth being made here: take a look at how the squeeze itself is proportionate, bipartite, and fits well into the isosceles triangle. The nature surely knows how to play with stonks, too.\n\nEspecially, when we talk about Fibonacci. The horizontal \ud83c\udf08 grid, Fibo retracement, is often used to estimate the possible corrective trend's depth, as well as to identify the key support and resistance levels of it. This one is comfortably applied to the beninging and the apex point of the trend (see the gray dash and dash line on the chart above), and its relevance is subsequently confirmed by how the price action plays around the levels in the triangle. The 12th of September '07 seems to be a good starting point for Fibo retracement application, because on that day another important resistance of $20.72 was penetrated for the first time (then confirmed as support with the beautiful bear trap candle on 23 Jan '08). Furthermore, $20.72 level works like an ideal 100% Fibo retrace level for the current example, and supports the 'Holy Grail' comparable to how my granny supports me. Also, take a note of the 'Purple Haze' being relatively in the middle, in between 78.6% and 100% of Fibo retracement - an important factor that will enable us to apply this retracement to GME later.\n\nNot only the 12th of September fits well as Fibo retracement starting point, it is also a perfect spot to start stretching out the trend-based Fib time grid (TBFTG - to be fucked then go, alternatively). This one is a complex instrument, so take this quick explanation for granted or do your own research in relation to it. Just like Fibo retracement, TBFTG is based on Fibonacci sequence, but this one applies to time periods, instead of the price action and levels. In order to use this instrument properly, it is necessary to identify the preliminary major trend, that will serve as the core measurement for the sequent time periods. Oh, it took me a lot of time to inspect that parameter and to identify those initial pink dash and dash trends, trust me! Tbh, it was one of the most difficult tasks to accomplish in the preparation of this TA. But the result was worth the effort! I noticed the following correlation applicable to both VWSS and TSLASS (and hypothetically to GME too): TBFTG pink dash measurement must involve the major preliminary impulse of the prior main trend, plus 'Squeezy Grail' phase. The staring point of TBFTG is particularly tricky to be identified, and I'm talking about all of the examples, but possible - especially when looking at the TA as a whole, referring to how the grid applies to the price action, and comparing the examples between each other. That is pure rocket science, if you ask me. And most importantly, the TBFTG measurement duration (pink dash and dash trend) seem to be very similar in length to 'Squieezluminati' basis - check the bars measurements on all of the charts (blue lines for VW).\n\nPay attention to the following features, which really help to dissect the squeezes' anatomies and to build the suitable technical framework: *the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurs in 0.382 TBFTG zone; and the squeeze lifts off in the first half of 0.618 zone, peaking at 1*; *TBFTG pink dash measurement includes major preliminary trend plus 'Squeezy Grail', as it has been mentioned above. Furthermore, the correlation in duration of TBFTG measurement and the triangle basis must once again be emphasized.*\n\nNoice, but let's move further.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Tesla, or how Elon Mask truly \u201cis become meme, Destroyer of shorts\u201d: Apr 2019 - Apr 2020\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTesla and the founder Elon Musk have confronted the short sellers on a regular basis, and even after the run-ins with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), for now, the former have been winning. The TSLA shorters were sitting on mark-to-market losses of over $40 billion in late 2020, as the company\u2019s shares exploded 740% last year. This information is based on data collected by Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, a fin-anal company.\n\nRemember the not so distant in past Tesla 'mania'? The prospects of Tesla\u2019s business and the furious opposition of bulls and bears, including famous fund managers like David Einhorn and Mark Spiegel (who still hold a strong opinion that TSLA is a house of cards ready to collapse), have over the years contributed to an extreme volatility in the stock price. Elon Musk openly criticized the short-sellers and their motivation to dig out and spread negative sentiment about the company. The 'taking Tesla private' play seemed to work out for the short-sellers as the stock price collapsed by about 50% from November 2018 to May 2019. After that, amidst Tesla\u2019s opening of the Shanghai Gigafactory and the announcement of the company's first annual operating profit exceeding analyst expectations, the tables have turned and the bear-beaten TSLA shares skyrocketed in price (not without noble WSBetters help, definitely). Needless to say, that previously steady short-sellers started getting anxious and scrambled to cover their positions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDusaniwsky told Institutional Investor (B2B media) that shorting Tesla is:\n\n>The longest unprofitable short I\u2019ve ever seen!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell, Mr. Dusaniwsky, WSB seem to have an answer for everything:\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/h3l5hayu02z61.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ecc69df97a282c4a22663e8487cf316488ed9d32\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile companies and founders often hold a scorn on short sellers, because they can bring down stock prices and cause the cost of capital to rise (or even do worse things, if you know what I mean), Musk\u2019s disdain for the short selling community is unrivaled. In the middle of 2020, Musk took a dig at short sellers by releasing 'short shorts'. These now sell at a premium on Ebay. It's all nice and good, but I have another cool merch idea - '**shortz r fuk**':\n\n[TSLASS, Daily Chart](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/f0qbrpqn22z61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=479c78e6763043f81e9ac2c75cf8a6c769d9eee4)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBeautiful, isn't it? Let's quickly run through the short squeeze anatomy checklist, thoroughly elaborated in the previous TA chapter via the example of VW. First things first, the 'Squeezy Grail' is present, but it resembles more of a V shape structure. Next, the 'Runway' stage is good-looking: a fucking massive gap happened there, and this time 78.6% Fibo level is tested during the 'Runway', being indicative of the TSLA bulls' crazy power. 'Squieezluminati Confirmed' is also really interesting here, as this time there is no isosceles triangle at its core structure, but rather a 'chainsaw'-like volatile price action taking place. Furthermore, you may see that inside of the triangle, there is the after-peak 78.6% Fibo zone retest, which in turn hedl and bounced the price back in the direction of... Moon. Blessed be the bulls!\n\nLooking at the 'Purple Haze' (which is again in between Fibo 78.6% and 100% \\[important!\\]), for TSLASS the major price level manifested at $52.46. During the first half of 2019, this level played a role of a magnetizing support, with the subsequent testing in March and the breakout to the downside in late April. Again, a lengthy, half a year long consolidation is taking place just below this level, and above Fibo 100% retracement. The breakout occurs, you guessed, right in the TBFTG 0.382 zone. And what is really fascinating, is the fact that, after the breakout, the 'Purple Haze' has never been retested. But who knows what the future holds?\n\nAnd the Fibos. The retracement, again, apples perfectly onto the complete squeeze structure: 78.6% is trialed several times; all of the upper levels except for 38.2% were broken with the subsequent retrace and and some with the retest. A particularly intensive price action was occurring for about two weeks near the 23.6% Fibo level, and the high of $189.4 level was penetrated and then touched gently during the initial squeeze. Ah, almost forgot, 100% ($35.75) Fibo level firmly holds the 'Squeezy Grail' in hand again.\n\nCurrent TBFTG should be of an interest for fellow TAnaLyzators too. Particularly, the downtrend, as opposed to VW uptrend, serves as the core for TBFTG's application (again, refer to the dash and dash pinkish line). This core is composed of the pre-'Squeezy Grail' downtrend plus the Grail itself. Take a look at gray measurements, which cover this phase and the triangle duration - again these two follow the tendency of being proportionate in the length as phases. *Crucially, the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurs in 0.382 TBFTG zone again; then one more time the squeeze lifts off in the first half of 0.618 zone, with the false first peak during the final stages of 0.618 and the proper peak at 1*.\n\nToo many coincidences and congruences between the two TA examples discussed above, if you ask me. Especially if the fact that such events happen once in ten years or so is taken into account. Two quotes are of a relevance here:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Coincidences mean you're on the right path - *Simon van Booy*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>If you gaze long enough into an asshole, the asshole will gaze back into you - u\/roman_axt\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome additional food for thought from TSLA:\n\n[For redditors with a different floor](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/gnd0yienc2z61.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b8b72e1671ad69cf871cde154ae386e52835e94a)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Game stopped, or it is just a beginning?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am absolutely confident that you all know even more than myself about the fundamental factors at play for GME, so I will not bother you here with the background explanation. There is a plenty of good HQ DD all around reddit, so let's jump straight to the sweet sweet TA:\n\n[GMESS, Daily Chart](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ko1ppnasc2z61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1d3f7c2a78135696d66a0a70e8e2a34ad4a04dbf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt this point, I feel that a disclaimer is necessary. Let me briefly remind you that this analysis is a thesis, or a hypothesis that has to be proven in the future. I do believe that there is a solid probability for things to play out this way, and my beard supports my manly confidence. However, this is the market, and it all may go another way at any point in time, that's the nature of things! Think critically, learn and do your own DD and TA. In a good memory of u\/ControlTheNarrative, at least.\n\nAnd so, it begins. Despite it may seem that there are too many unknown or at least questionable variables for now in this GMESS TA, I believe that I was able to identify the most crucial parameters to build the core of this technical analysis's thesis, since VWSS and TSLASS provided many clues and identifiable characteristics to refer to. The first and most important one is surely the 'Purple Haze'. I should remind you, that this mystically sounding level persistently held back the price for both of the squeeze examples discussed, and only upon the breakout of this level the short squeezes were initiated. For GME this major price level seems to be at about $233 mark, with two intensive tests in Jan and Mar, which proved it to be the most significant resistance on the chart above.\n\nThen, the shapes. The 'Squeezy Grail' (again occurring in between 78.6% and 100%) consolidation is also easily identifiable here, and it is yet again followed by the rectangular 'Runway' consolidation, where the price action currently stands. Remember, how historically (in TSLA and VW) the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurred somewhere near the spot of the current GME price action, in 0.382 Fibo time zone? Well, to paraphrase Ian Fleming: once is (VW) happenstance. Twice is (TSLA) coincidence. Three times is GMenemy action.\n\nFibos. Applying these two instruments to GME was real pain in the ass. Firstly, because the retracement is not usually used as a predictive instrument, being ordinarily applied to the completed trend. But since the situation is not ordinary at all, I played smarter (or more autistic, if you like). Due to the fact that the 'Purple Haze' level was approximately in between 78.6% and 100% Fibo in both of the previous examples, I assumed exactly that to be applicable here too. My belief is firmly backed up by this soft touch of 78.6% by the price action on Jan 28th. And when these two major levels were identified, the Fibo retracement horizontal grid just stretched out on GME itself.\n\nIdentifying the starting points for the trend for both Fibos was the most tricky part. After countless attempts and failures I found what I believe to be the cornerstone to the squeeze:\n\n[Fibos' initiation point zoomed in](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/t2ouren1d2z61.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1cd87d96bb42ac20451c86059295f7560c8c44e8)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy? Because this                        \u261d\ufe0f is clearly where the fun started.\n\nAnd now it all matches perfectly. So, I am patiently waiting for the 'Purple Haze' to be broken. And what do you do, fellow retard?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey say, that coincidence doesn't happen a third time.

Majority of stocks gained in mentions this week following their earnings report. The returns were a mixed bag for the companies even after exhibiting stellar growth. \n\n**Rocket companies($RKT)** shares fell 16% on Thursday following their first-quarter results. Even though their revenue increased by 236% and net income by 170%, investors appeared to focus on the guidance provided by Rocket. They said that they expect to close a loan volume of $82-$87 Billion which would represent a significant decline. This along with rising interest rates and inflation concerns caused the stock price to tank. \n\n**Etsy($ETSY)** was also trending due to very similar reasons where they reported exceptional first-quarter results but management guidance for the second quarter was mediocre. The stock was down 13% but a lot of users were extremely bullish on the company and were considering the drop as a good entry point for long-term hold which is reflected in the sentiment. \n\n**Corsair($CRSR)** also delivered an exceptional quarter with first-quarter revenue increasing by more than 72% to $529MM. The growth majorly came from their Gamer and Creator peripherals segment which is far more profitable than the regular systems. Even though Reddit and Twitter users are bullish on the stock, the stock still sold off more than 6% from the top after the earnings report. \n\n**Peloton($PTON)** had a wild week with the stock dropping 15% on Wednesday following a full recall of their Tread and Tread+ treadmills. The US CPSC had called for a recall months ago but the company had initially resisted the accusations. The recall of more than 130K units is expected to be a logistical nightmare.  \n\n**SOME FAQ\u2019s:**\n\nHow does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).\n\nWhat is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here is the average across all the comments.\n\nThank you for reading!\n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor.*","840":"God Tier DD, Buy NOW & Get Rich Monday \nSup apes \ud83e\udd8d.

We're \"inexperienced investors\" and \"unqualified people on social media\". We need an \"intermediary or financial advisor\". The SEC is \"gonna vigorously lean in against individuals... ...to assess\". # US House Financial Services Committee hearing on GameStop\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is a transcript of the question from Rep. David Scott (GA-13):\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>***Rep. David Scott (GA-13):***  \n>  \n>The question before us today is this: How can we on the Financial Services Committee ensure that our investors can both have access to our markets, but also are able to participate in our markets investing safely? You see when erroneous and inaccurate information posted on social media sites has the ability to broadly influence investors and move the market sometimes drastically. This, gentleman, poses a serious question for you, our regulators. *There is now such a huge hole in our regulatory process because of GameStop with inexperienced investors relying on unverified information from unqualified social media.*  \n>  \n>Mr. Cook, let me start with you: *\\[1\\] How can we effectively regulate the impact of new technology social media sites as they pertain to inexperienced investors? \\[2\\] And also, how do we treat that investment advice that we're getting from unqualified people on social media? \\[3\\] And then the real question, who is held accountable when that investment advice leads to market volatility like we've seen and massive losses for our investors?* I'd like for the three of you: Chair Gensler, Mr. Cook, Mr. Bodson... Answer this important question in the three parts that I outlined it for. This is what the American people need answers to from you regulators. Mr. Cook, why don\u2019t you start.  \n>  \n>***Mr. Robert Cook, President and CEO of FINRA:***  \n>  \n>Well, thank you thank you congressman for that question. I think you raised some really profound questions about where technology and other aspects of investor behavior may be going and how does that fit within the current regulatory regime. When we talk about statements by people on social media and other places, just to be clear, FINRA doesn't regulate that environment and we would look to the SEC in, sort of, understanding whether existing authorities around concepts like manipulation or providing investment advice might apply.  \n>  \n>*I do think that what we have also seen, though, and your point about retail investors making decisions without an intermediary or financial advisor is an important one. As we see more of that happen we are seeing a lot of that happen. I think we need to ask whether the existing regime is adequate in that regard.*  \n>  \n>***Rep. David Scott (GA-13):***  \n>  \n>Let me quickly get to Chair Gensler. I\u2019ve worked with him when he was chair of the CFTC. Chair, how do we hold somebody accountable? Answer this for me, as Mr. Cook just said, the SEC he said is the one responsible. How do we hold somebody... Well, what do we do about this, Chair Gensler?  \n>  \n>***Chair Gensler of the SEC:***  \n>  \n>I think you raise a good point. I know like, probably like me, it's not about somebody's free speech rights on social media but if somebody is trying to manipulate a market to defraud the market through social media and in our rapidly changing technology, it could be computers and not even humans, by the way, it could be computers communicating in. *So the SEC is a cop on the beat. We're gonna vigorously lean in against individuals and companies to try to assess. But we'll have to update our resources too to be able to see \\[those\\] relationships.*  \n>  \n>***Rep.

Also said that degenerates made AMC and GME worth something and most probably made something from nothing.

We are looking forward to the US market opening in \\~4 hours. In order to be prepared for the undergoing trend-change, we are going to have a quick look on the chart.  \n\n\n[https:\\\/\\\/www.tradingview.com\\\/x\\\/Bbhn1dBH\\\/](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/1i18187enov61.png?width=2020&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b0b6345d359ec3fdb37790c3ea59a4b03438956)\n\nThe full chart is visible [here](https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/x\/Bbhn1dBH\/). We can see that the price was accumulating in a symmetrical triangle from March to this date. As soon as the price is hitting the demand zone (red channel), we see a strong reaction from the buyers on the market. While the sellers are preventing the buyers from making higher highs, we can also observe that the buyers support the price with higher lows - which results in the symmetrical shape.  \nThis is a simplification of how the buyers & sellers are acting on the market, and they are finally the ones who decide where the price is going next. The decreasing volume confirms this behavior. This breakout will drag more interest into the market, and we will see more price action (more volume).  \n\n\nNow we're looking at a change of structure\/ sentiment. The buyers were basically stronger than the sellers, and they managed to push the price above the previous high at $165.00, which is the first sign of an upwards trend. When we're looking at an upwards trend, we want to price to make higher highs and higher lows, supported by increasing volume. We want the market participants to confirm the breakout with trading action.  \n\n\nBuyers & Sellers usually look for previous price peaks to either leave the market or to enter the market. So we can expect small retracements at the previous highs (horizontal lines), followed by further price movements towards the next high.  \nThis upwards trend is currently supported by the MA200 (grey line), which is a great entry for those wo might want to join the party.  \n\n\nHave fun trading apes!","847":"Remember Gamestop's share offering?

We are in the mist of forming wave C.  That will be interpreted in the following paragraph. From this standpoint, we have strong support level at 23.6 fib level (priced 142.79). It was actually broken, but that level was a *test* to see how far it will go down. It found support again (twice) on several different locations (weeks later) This is very important because the psychology of the market (investors) show a threshold and now pointing towards a bullish movement - even though we were consolidating. Now, per elliot wave analysis, Wave 3 is the **BIGGEST** wave of the 5 wave formation. It  must past the high of 488.51 in order to be called a elliot wave 3 or C wave. There are several *mini* resistance levels we must past but as I am typing, we pushed past two of them. The next important level of all is Price $200 which is surprisingly at fib level 38.2. Thats a magic number for later. We can *predict where Wave 3 may end* and that number is 504 .34- 531.72. (math not included) \n\nRefer to image: https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/cw86Lhx.jpg\nThis image basically tells me half time is over and the bell just rung. The pendant is forming or has already formed.  Its a signal and confirms the psychoanalysis of market (retail investors and all) that there is a upward movement. However, there needs to be a stimulus or break out movement out. This image now focuses on our micro analysis of wave 3 (C). Wave 1 of wave C has completed and assumingly so, wave 2 (b) of bigger wave 3 is consolidating (pendant). Quick fib analysis: We find resistance at fib level 23.6 (priced at 169.26). Then again we have fib level 38.2 hovering around price 200 (remember this - important later down the road). If we want some kind of breakout, we need to close above 200, followed by some stimulus (upward movement factor). In addition, this pendant formed a higher lows but also lower highs (consolidation). \n\nOn the daily,\n* if we close above 169-170, thats a great start\n* Then close above 200, price movement is building momentum for wave C - which should have the biggest momentum of all 5 waves\n* Theoretically, it needs to close above 351.90 to confirm wave 3(C), but remember thats only the smaller version of Wave 3. \n\nIf this happens, it can theoretically push bigger wave 5 to around 800 (depends on market volatility and demand) to XXXXs. \n\n TLDR: Wave 3's forming. There is a pressure on GME market and it may be bullish movement from now on. Consolidation may be done if it can close above micro support levels. \n\nIm not a financially literate to be a financial advisor, but just shooting blanks, i think.

Every week or so I've been keeping track of option prices at different strikes.  When GME first lifted off to the Moon the market was pricing a dramatic move within 1 week.  When it was at $325 around the end of January the 1 week move was plus or minus 40%.  That means a 1 week option at a strike of $325 cost about $130.

You could buy some insurance by buying longer dated call spreads in the $80 - $100 range as they are cheap right now.   Also, keep in mind as I stated in my previous post that the cheaper options b\/c the more ability retail has to control the price through aggressive buying of shares and options.

If the stock ever does drop below $100 I imagine the out of the money call options will be relatively cheap at first which could be a good buying opportunity.\n\nEveryone is waiting to hear the transformation plan led by Ryan Cohen.

This can link to the fact that we are breaking out of a descending triangle.\n\n\\- Soon enough with George Sherman stepping down as Chief Executive we can hope the next candidate can sustain GME as a company better than Sherman did.\n\n\\- Last but not least, I have to mention the breakout to the downside price target which is 40$ however I think it is highly unlikely for that scenario to play out.\n\nPlease have a look at my TA in the screenshot, I've labeled each indication for you apes to see something other than crayons.\n\nTL;DR - In the next 1-2 weeks expect GME to go Brrrr \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 OTM Calls are finally going to pay.. xd","852":"DD: MVIS go BRRRR and I don't care which way. My medium-term bull case for MVIS.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Buy MVIS shares, sell way OTM monthly covered calls for absurd premiums.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDisclaimer - I wrote this Sunday night after I decided on my course of action. I did not post until now because I wanted to actually do the trades before posting the DD. The numbers herein reflect prices at that time and they have since changed slightly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm fucking new at this. I got in with GME, I admit it. I'm probably completely fucked on this thesis, and I encourage you all to shit all over it so that I don't lose all my tendies on some batshit weed-induced fantasy. I don't know what I'm doing, and if you follow me you're literally retarded. That being said...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI yolo'd my entire net worth on MVIS today. I'm poor, so this was only 500 shares, but fuck you. We all start somewhere. I just started late... and waited some more. And then missed the bus.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPositions:\n\n3 GME @ 238\n\n500 MVIS @ 11.49 avg\n\n\\-5 MVIS 521 18c (0.70 premium realized)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe most important factor in my thesis is the high IV of MVIS. Looking back at the last year, the IV and HV have been consistently high, which given the incredibly swingy nature of this WSB stock is not unexpected.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn my research, which was probably half-assed and woefully inadequate, a high IV is a stock with above 60% or so, and the top few are above 100. MVIS is at 160%. Historically for the last year, this is not abnormal for MVIS. GME is also around 160% right now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHigh IV means that the options chain is often very expensive. Lots of people are gambling on this stock moving quickly, so you can sell covered calls for inflated premiums.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLets do some quick and dirty math.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor our purposes we will use May 21 exp.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGME: current 155. 521 300c is 8.35 (strike = \\~193% current price)\n\nMVIS: current 11. 521 20c is 0.80 (strike = \\~182% current price)\n\nRKT current 22 521 30c is 0.26 (strike = \\~136% current price)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, lets look at a metric that probably has a name I don't know: (premium \/ stock price). This tells me that for every dollar I have invested into a stock, I can earn that amount for the option. This lets me rate options based on what I expect returns to be for selling covered calls.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGME: 5.387%\n\nMVIS: 7.273%\n\nRKT: 1.182% (IV is \\~60%)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt 7.27% returns on a monthly option, if MVIS were to magically trade sideways and also keep its high IV for a year, you would have nearly doubled your money even if the stock ended the year at the exact same price.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf MVIS drops, it will retain its high IV and you can continue to add shares and sell more monthlies until it rebounds. (Or you can trade the high IV to be much riskier with your pricing until it eventually catches you, hopefully turning a profit in the end - you're a paper handed bitch too)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf MVIS spikes, you have a lot of opportunity to cash in because you are holding shares. Sure you could have \\*bought\\* calls instead of selling them, but I want to sell the lottery tickets not buy them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMVIS is currently dirt cheap at $11, and has been red all month. I think it's close to its bottom and is about to pop right back up a few bucks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOk, so let's talk potential gains and losses.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBecause my position is shares, my losses are fairly limited as I believe based on absolutely no evidence except a couple charts I saw once that there is a fairly hard floor of about $7 that it'll just never drop past again ever. Therefore my maximum loss is maybe $5\/share. If I can get 0.80 premiums every month, then in six months I've basically covered my loss and can exit a slightly wiser ape. Or double down and keep selling the IV (This. I'll do this. It's just a dip. Buy more!)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf the stock trades sideways for months and sheds its IV, then I continue to sell calls until I think I can get higher gains elsewhere, and I exit the position with less profit than I had hoped, but no losses.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf the stock spikes but does not pass my strike, I roll the options out (and possibly up) and try to capitalize on the short term spike in IV and premiums. I keep holding until either the IV or stock price drops below levels I am happy with.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf the stock spikes past my strike (currently $18) then I am assigned and exit the trade +$3,250 plus any premiums I got.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn summary: I don't care if this stock moons, plunges, or charts a path like the fucking Evergiven as long as its IV stays high. I'm just gonna build my position and sell lotto tickets to people even dumber than me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm pretty confident in this, so I'm probably fucked. Please teach me. If you want charts and graphs, fuck you do your own DD. If you want rocket emojis, this thread is accepting donations.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdited to show actual #s reflective of my trading today.","853":"I counted all the GME Yolos Part 3 Hi Everyone,\n\nIn case you missed my first posts on my efforts of counting gme yolos they can be found here: [Part 1](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/mdex64\/dd_i_counted_all_the_wallstreetbets_gme_yolos\/) [Part 2](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/me13xm\/dd_part_2_i_counted_all_the_wallstreetbets_gme\/)\n\nTo summarize I am manually recording every instance of people posting their positions.  I have dedupped the data and interestingly the only instances of repeat users has been users increasing their positions. This could be because the type of the user to post their position is fully committed or if they do decrease their position they won't post. Either way pretty interesting. I am making some pretty stupid assumptions that of all the positions I have recorded no one has paper handed. Previously I had recorded 261 yolos holding 339,958 shares.\n\n**Updated Data:** Since then I have recorded an additional 212 positions for a total of **473** positions representing **576,433** shares. With current after hours share prices of $160.81 these shares represent **$92,696,190.73** or for those that can't read big numbers **92.7 million**.\n\nAs I had mentioned in my previous posts I personally believe the [rule of 1%](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/1%25_rule_%28Internet_culture%29) on the internet applies to these yolo positions and for every position posted there are likely 10-100 that are silent.

I LOVE DOING some ANALysis occasionally, like many of you here. And I like memes, as much as I like the stock. Furthermore, WSB took important place in my life recently, so I decided to give back to the community, creating this comprehensive memeful ape-friendly GME DD \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15\ud83e\ude90\ud83c\udf0c In the process of researching GME I was able to accumulate the material into this ape-friendly long read, largely aimed at newcomers of the sub. Though, this giant brain candy can and should be enjoyed by anybody!  \nI have to warn you, apester, this is a super duper long read and it will take a considerable amount of your time as well as about 140% (several estimations state that the percentage might even be as high as 420-696.9%) of brain resources. However, it is completely worth it to read it in full, I promise you - ap~~e~~ transcendence is imminent upon completing the reading. Also, do it for the love to memes, because I genuinely handcrafted about 15 memes and put it here for your satisfaction.\n\nMy fundamental idea behind this colossal, voluminous piece of work was to build a framework for myself (and other interested apes), as to be aware of where it all stands now, how it all got here, and the likely outcomes of this spectacular show you have all been observing and participating in. Furthermore, I tried my best to make the language as simple as possible, using **ELIA**s (**E**explain **L**ike **I**'m an **A**pe) where possible, and doing my best in elaborating on difficult financial concepts and terms for this intellectually limited individuals with extraordinary small brain capacity that you all are. This work is structured in such a way so that even with zero knowledge in the subject, you will be able to grasp all of the important concepts from the first go. It is especially important for the newcomers of this sub, influx of whom might happen, should any major potential catalyst unwhale. So, do not hesitate to share this even with 1\/10 brain-wrinkled individuums. I believe in your mental capabilities apemeisters (though, I know that at this point it is a pure gamble - and I am in the right place for that).\n\nAnd yeah, this a not a financial advice, and I am not a financial advisor. Just and ape with one and a half brain wrinkles (hopefully).\n\n**LR; TD (Long Read; To Do) by Master Yoda:**\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/nz4ujbu2ujt61.png?width=487&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e45b0bcd43bd5b0247f413b1978e7e246801c41\n\nThe story addressed is as old as this world, and it involves greed, manipulation, exploitation, corruption and decay; as well as unity, bravery (abreast retardation), optimism, support and and creative forces. The eternal battle of good and evil, no matter how corny it sounds. Compulsory buckle up and eat a crayon apefriend, that's going to be a ride!\n\n# Chapter I. The Short, the Squeeze and the Ugly\n\nThe story begins with a hedge fund (HF from here on), and there is really nothing particular about this HF. For general understanding of an ape that knows nothing: \"A **hedge** **fund** is an investment partnership - the marriage of a fund manager and investors who pool their money together into the fund, with the objective of earning active return.\" - The **game** is that simple, thanks, Inve **stop** edia, you are always spot on! The HF might have been named by whichever name exists, it really does not matter for history. What is actually important, is the setting in which it operated, and the rules, according to which this HF played (and also exploited). In this particular case, the antagonist is called Melvin Capital Management LP (MC thereafter). However, I would encourage you not to get attached to names; but instead view the antagonist as a collective image, as an intrusive parasite, which appears as soon as a suitable environment exists for that. And where there is one parasite, there will come many.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\"ButT wat did di Hedgehogs do so that ther is sO mutch indiEgnation boUt t?\"**\n\nYou are asking the right questions here, my little ape-man fellow. Only the lazy haven't scolded the HF, and as a matter of fact there are solid grounds to do so. Briefly, the antagonists exploited the loophole (do not confuse with the loop hole in your head, apemeister) in the short selling mechanism, which effectively allowed them to severely manipulate the market for their benefit. Furthermore, the bad guys have been doing that for years and even decades. GME is a very indicative, even whistleblowing example of the wrongdoing being done. All of these issues will be **D**ug **D**eeper into and discussed in detail further on, but let me start from the basics for half-wrinkled beginner apes to catch up with us, one whole wrinkle elitists.\n\n**SHORT SELLING ELIA.** You are a smart entrepreneurial ape, and you obtained the information that led you to believe that the banana market will be aplenty this year (banana harvest go BBBRRRRR) and as a result the prices will drop significantly. The ape progress is so advanced, that you are able to enter a contractual relationship with another apedividual. This guy is known to have a big bulk of bananas just laying around, so you use this opportunity to borrow those for a period of time and agree to give those back later with the premium. The other ape sees you as a credible partner (understandable, as you went to Apeuke University and received MBA there - Master of Banana Appreciation degree)  thus lending you 100 bananas for one ape dollar each. You then rush to the local ape banana market 'ooh ooh ahh ahh'-ing all the way in great cheer for what a businessape apemomma raised. You sell the goods for $100 and wait. Because your due diligence was apegod-tier, the plan worked and one banana now costs 0.5 ape dollars. You then buy 100 banananas back from the market for $50 and give it back to the apelender, as well as a small premium agreed upon previously. ???? **PROFIT!!!!** (of about 50 bucks)\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/x0hwq95cujt61.png?width=503&format=png&auto=webp&s=353e830d77c215761c0b595610eac2e2e98a9c65\n\nHowever, the example above only illustrates the perfect world, where all apes are honest apes and the ape market does not have inefficiencies. The current problem with short selling is that at one moment GME had the highest percentage of float shorted in the world, amounting to about 140% (and by many it is considered to be a rookie number, even currently). Yes, it does mean that more shares were sold short than shares existed. It is a big issue, let's discuss it in detail. One important point before we dive deeper, though. Lately I saw many honorable 'traders' ( ' ' marks mean that the word is used as an anagram) in comments criticizing the short mechanism as a whole, viewing it negatively and in some extreme examples even advocating the prohibition of it. And even though,\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/xt8bt34hujt61.png?width=488&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6506e88f0d417c5c62cde5ba20cd2c7ac39b170\n\n, at this point it is important to mention that short selling is an integral part of the markets for a variety of reasons. In addition to creating liquidity to help make a market, short selling allows people to benefit from a stock price going down (as explained in the bananas ELIA above) leveling the playing field for those looking to make all types of investments. Short selling is an essential component of market stability (as long as it is not exploited, surely): hence sometimes longs are blinded by euphoria and optimism and there\u2019s no one to hold these companies' feet to the fire, short sellers look at companies with a bit more of a critical eye than the average investor. Ooh, I'm starting to sound like a \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b, so forgive me permabullapes, as I have sinned, forgetting and ignoring the only autistic postulate to live by here, and that is: \"STONKS ONLY GO UP\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\"k Shortz IMPOrTENT but hoW iZ 140% bananana sell? Ape iNfinit maniy go BrrrRrr?\"**\n\nYeah, you caught it right, smoothie-brainie. The main components to that are so-called IOUs, settlement cycles, leverage, excessive borrowing, failures to deliver, and, most importantly:\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/rgbvoyrlujt61.png?width=488&format=png&auto=webp&s=00239d43b35be1f158734b19e14fedb4be05bcf2\n\nI am sorry that your head exploded after looking at the words aforementioned above, I really am! But this is how the evolution works, and you just fell victim to it. Nevermind, just collect the shattered pieces of your brain (about two grams, should not take long), put it back into the empty vessel that your head is, and fix it with some duct tape, I dunno. Jokes aside, let's continue, and now I will explain the cornerstone concepts of IOU obligations (abbreviation of I Owe You) as well as FTDs (failures to deliver), as these will be prevalent through the entire discussion. Starting from the basics first:\n\n**IOUs ELIA**. Your ape grandma lived a busy life and she has a lot of ape-dollars as her savings. She heard about the banana price increase hype as everyone's been talking about it, so she decided to buy some for her own. Luckily, there is a decent broker called Bananality, and because she feels like really shaking the old days, she YOLOs all her savings into the bananas of BanaNonStop Corp. So far so good? \ud83d\udc3b with me. As soon as apema pays for the banana stock, the money and the bananas have to change hands, and this is called 'settlement'. In many ape countries money and bananas change hands two days after the trade, and that is called 'T+2'. Ideally, this processes have to take place simultaneously. But in the current ape financial system bananas are divorced from money, thus her money may settle independently of  bananas settlement. Before the trade settles, ape grandma will be holding banana IOUs on her account, and importantly these are IOUs for BANANAS, not for money. Furthermore, the system sees her IOUs as normal stock bananas. In the perfect ape world, the blockage does clear up after T+2, and Bananality is able to send the banana stock through the system hence the IOUs are wiped out.\n\n**Failures to Deliver (FTDs) ELIA**. Now let's imagine that apema was not so lucky in choosing her broker and ran into a crook, who wants to deliberately exploit the system of settlement and the broker is called Bananaked. The grandma enters the trade, the money settles, however, something blocks Bananaked from settling its shares through the system. And this something is nothing but a malicious intent, as all the the broker did was issuing banana IOU's with no real intention of covering it according to the rules. It might even be the case, that Bananaked never held those shares which he sold. If at the moment of T+2 settlement the IOUs are not covered by the banana stocks, it creates a deliberate, strategic failure to deliver. FTDs will be involved in the discussion later on, as these are the main vehicles through which the loophole is exploited (still, not as bad as your hole is exploited, though). Well, fuck you, Bananaked, the day will come and you will be dealt with for messing up with apema, mark my ape word!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\"My brraIn hurtz caN i go home PleZ?\"**\n\nPuts on your brain then. Just eat a banana, or a Crayon, you will be fine... Allrighty, you convinced me. Lets dive out of theory and discuss GAMEEESTOOOOP, finally! We will jump back to the concepts elaborated upon above as soon as the context is necessary for that. Here, Wen Moon got your back and he will cheer you up for your dedication to reading!\n\n[\\\\\"Camon ape ya can do it, read and evolve!\\\\\" - Wen Moon.](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/cboe9744vjt61.jpg?width=1059&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cffb0db75e9a238bd26bb7d36b2b78b509be34ec)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\"oKay i candO yit, fUkc mah braIn wit moore nowledge mtfakeRr!\"** \\- an ape.\n\nThat's the approach I needed. Remember about antagonistic MC? No, not the one who performed at your ape party last weekend and did it pretty bad. I'm talking about Melvin Capital. So, the main story line begins in 2014, the year when MC started to short the stock that I like very, very much. Gabe Plotkin, MC manager stated that fact proudly himself, during the first Congressional Hearing. There were several big fundamental reasons to bet on GME decline at that time, among which: company's debts and financial position, digitalization of the gaming industry, consoles sales \\[big part of the revenue\\] super-cycle moving away from its apex (and later on, the pandemic happened, which added dramatically to the negative sentiment). Let's take a look at the chart of GME:\n\n[GME Monthly Chart, 2014-2019 highlighted](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/fr7lat7kvjt61.png?width=2129&format=png&auto=webp&s=b93e9ba2885b5093a8687aa249fdb2dce0bc5676)\n\nAs you may see, the chart covers a relatively long period of time, and the big red REKTangle here highlights the fat and nasty, steady downward trend. From the current outlook on things, it is obvious that MC made a correct financial decision, shorting the stock from its highs of about $45 a share, all the way down to about 3-6 dollars per share diapason starting in the middle of 2019. That is a whooping gain of more than ninety(90)!!! %, or more than forty dollars per share gain! Impressive numbers, aren't they? Yeah, you won: you were right betting against the company; you've made shit tons of money; your wife's boyfriend accepted your dominance as an alpha 'trader' (anagram) ape and voluntarily left the family, now FIX YOUR FUCKING PROFITS AND CLOSE YOUR POSITION! Why did the shorters not cover when they had a perfect opportunity window for that LASTING FOR MORE THAN A FUCKING YEAR? Because of the bankruptcy jackpot.\n\nAs it was explained previously short selling is an important market instrument and it may deliver net decent profits for investors who thoroughly calibrate the risk; the 'bankruptcy jackpot' is a relatively uncommon situation which promises a much larger pay off should it occur. And it is an extremely risky bet, the one that only the epic 'traders' are willing to undertake (so, to some extent it is possible to say, that MC belongs to WSB). The HFs were driven by the fact, that in the event of insolvency, any collateral provided to back up the shorted shares has to be returned to the short seller. Furthermore, as it is no longer necessary to return the shares shorted, the shortist takes it all, the whole profit. As soon as the it became obvious for HFs that the copany should soon go buncrupt, the MHFs decided to 'help' Gamestop and invoked their dirty trick of naked short selling to the full power (the mechanism is discussed below). Before the Ryan Cohen updates, the consensus and the market sentiment on the greatest stock of all time was severely grim. So, why not go all in if you had already won it all (HF reasoning)?\n\nThey dared to YOLO, 140% or more type of YOLO...\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/8l0ujmtsvjt61.png?width=486&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a2deb71b74665b5d5395a97249941d74570a9b1\n\nAnd soon the shitshow of an unimaginable scale begins to uncover itself. But before that...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\"WatT hapenT nExt telL meh rn ya cheeKY wahnKerR!1? How dit dey YOYO?\"**\n\nEverything has its time, young padawan, don't hurry. The second half of 2020 brought several substantial catalysts for the dramatic shift of GME consensus towards being positive, accordingly, pushing the price of the stock to the upside. And to a great extent it has to be attributed to one fellow, and you all know his name. Yes, apeladies and gentleapes, this is your hero and savior, <in Leeroy's Jenkins voice> RYYYYYAAAAANN COOOOHEEEN. If by now you do not know this guy, then you can't really call yourself an ape, things don't work like that here, go and duckduckgo him or something!\n\nBy buying a big stake of GME \\[12.91% currently\\], RC (and his Ventures) brought a lot of attention to the company, giving the market sentiment a powerful bullish impulse, and then accelerating it even further by getting deeper involved into the business operation and the development of GameStop. At this point, it is fair to say, that many of the pioneering bulls were jumping into the market buying rumors.\n\n[Many, but not u\\\/DeepFuckingValue of course. This guy is out of this world.](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/v7m84mkqwjt61.png?width=486&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5bbbf5afcba1ec73751912ce860f7bc397ee640)\n\nIt is with the new updates that were being poured out of the bucket, the investors, \u2018traders\u2019 and general market participants found out that: GameStop is underway towards its digital transformation (online sales increased in 300% Q3 2020); internal restructuring bound to the new growth strategy, resulting in CFO replacement; new consoles supercycle starting with PS5 and XBox Series X\/S releases (historically very strong periods for *GME*), and many, many more under the hood developments of which we are not even aware of, or only start to find out about (just type the word 'delivery' into the search of a friendly *sub*). To conclude on that point:\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/bm94jyf0xjt61.png?width=468&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ec245cad38eb6d05c47ee5d168e5e498c45840a\n\nWhen a general market sentiment changes from negative to positive, it is usually a bad idea to bet against it. Even WSB 'traders' understand this fundamental principle (correct me if I'm wrong), and this is where you, honorable 'Trader' with capital later, started to outplay the 'Big Guys'. Literally, the  \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b HFs fell victim to their own relentless greed and stupidity, forgetting the golden trading rule that the trend is your friend until the end, and they did it spectacularly. Furthermore, instead of closing the positions and cutting the losses, they kept YOLOing and shorted more and more, in an attempt to suppress the buying pressure. And literally, now all that it takes you to show an awesome 'tradering' performance this year, is to buy, and hold.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\"Okeh ape undeErstant now GEEmeEe go BBRRRRR. How about shorts, though?\"**\n\nDafaq, you are evolving ape, look at how you are able to communicate! That's one whole correctly structured question with no 'TrAdEratIon'. Keep it up! And yeah, what about shorts? Briefly:  \n\n\n# shortz r fuk\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Short Squeeze ELIA**. Finally, it is time to discuss the most juicy squeezey piece of the puzzle. Let's refer to the short selling ELIA now. Remember how the businessape from the first ELIA happily brought the bananas to the ape market and in anticipation of the prices falling, sold his borrowed banana stock. Now, imagine that the forecast was not justified, and the things went according to the worst scenario possible: the banana harvest was poor and these became scarce; having bananas is now fashionable, and every ape wants to put their hands on what's hot; poor harvest, but because of abundant sunlight the bananas left are very delicious, so apes are ready to fight for putting it in their mouths... and etc. The businessape rushes around, panicking, begging for bananas, but these are nowhere to be found, because apemeisters hodl precious with their diamond ape hands; or, are only willing to sell 1-2 bananas for a ridiculous price of 500.000-1.000.000 ape dollars. The businessape now understands how screwed he is. He also recalls that the ape-guy he borrowed bananas from is an apemafiozi with a very bad reputation, because of punishing his failed debtors by putting LARGE bananas into their ANALysis. Fiasco, isn't it? The businessape now has nothing left to do, but to buy the banans back with any price available. Fortunately, the fortune he earned through decades of successful business is sufficient for covering his debts. And if not, you better recapitalize, ape pal, before bananas play a cruel joke on your ANALysis.\n\nApemeister! Don't hesitate to pause the reading and eat a Crayon if you need to.

I started to worry about you evolving too fast, now we're back to normal. \ud83d\udc3b with me, this is the most interesting part.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/gnxvi3bgxjt61.png?width=487&format=png&auto=webp&s=86b3a89e5c245e5ba1a22fb09df4ac9cbb120dd7\n\nRemember IOUs, FTDs, HFs' YOLO 140% SI? Pepperidge apes remember. Ok, so, basicly short interest is a number that indicates the proportion of the shares in circulation (also called a float) sold short. Based on the businessape example, it would mean that he borrowed 100 out of 100 bananas available to being borrowed, went to the ape market and sold 140 bananas. Dafaq? How is that even possible? This is a complicated process, which I aim to discuss with a very in-**D**epth **D**ive, but in a separate post, Chapter II (as this post is voluminous enough already), alongside with dark pools, payment for order flow, sales restrictions, and other fuckeries for that matter.\n\nFor now, take a look at the following, and refer back to IOUs and FTDs ELIAs if necessary. According to T+2 settelment, the share has to be setteled no letter than two working days after the trade has been made. Before the settlement, what you hold on your 'tradering' account is an obligation for this share that you just bought - IOU. On a properly functioning market and not being exploited, T+2 has its positive effects too, providing additional liquidity to the system. However, when we talk about short selling, its effects can be destructive. Particularly, the loophole is used as an instrument to leverage the short position, without providing the adequate collateral in the short selling process which has to be, well you guessed, a share! And this process is being made three times cheaper for big players, as market makers operate based on T+6 settlement rule. That is to say, T+X makes it possible to back up your short position and create additional, artificial selling pressure by using IOUs which, in the nature of this mechanism, work as counterfeit collateral, and in its essence being nothing but\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/05e17wklxjt61.png?width=485&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b19d340a5a2d1f6ebd7af4da14cc9e953fad2ae\n\nFurthermore, if you overuse or even overabuse this mechanism (to 140% and more), you may find yourself in a very unfortunate situation, similarly, to the one that MC and shorters found themselves in. Literally, by repeating this process over and over again, they put themselves into the trap, resulting in an inability to cover the excessive amount of shares borrowed, breeding FTDs in an futile attempt to fight the buying pressure. The key point to be made here is that it is often more profitable for big market participants to pay a fine, rather than letting the FTD game get loose, because the rules and laws in this area are not strict enough. Then, when nobody looks at the problem, well, the problem goes away. \u0421ounterfeit IOUs morphing into FTDs allow shorters to manipulate the market by artificially decomposing the buying pressure, but as it is a double edged sword - there is a high chance that the accumulated compression will fucking blow in your face at the inevitable moment. Once, ONCE in the history of 'traderation', the 'BIG MONEY' YOLOd against you, respectable 'trader', and they fucking lost spectacularly. When it is obious for everybody that you lost, it is probably a good idea to cut your loses and close the positions. Can you see the beauty of their YOLO? It is almoast as good as GUH (if you don't know what it means, YT it urgently - GUH WSB!). The artificial selling pressure that is accumulating into a ticking atomic bomb is just crazy, and oh boy, would I not want to be on that side of the trade now, getting my ass torn apart by this blast, as soon as it is no longer possible to constrain it.\n\nFurthermore, and most importantly, if they can use these pesky techniques now, how do you know that they did not use that in 2014, when the initail GME mega downtrand was born? With the media being used as a manipulation instrument currently, it might have also been used as a tool to formulate the negative outlook on Gamestop starting from 2014 too... That is just crazy and mindblowing, isn't it?\n\nMore than that, many new fuckeries were revealed: RobbingHood trade restrictions, cheating with ETF's and calls, short attacks, you know the list. This is utterly unfair, so the only available option for me in this delicate situation everybody found themselves in, was to buy and hold, because I like the stock. The end.

While some broker platforms have pretty great tools for retail level investment, they are not clear or easy to use. 3-5 times per day, I've been scraping the entire options chain for most of the meme stocks and high volume tickers. I've been collecting data for about a month now. \n\nI wanted to share some data with my fellow apes that I think presents good information in a clear and easy to understand way. Recently, there has been reports of a drop in option activity from retail investors. It would be a shame if this degeneracy didn't continue, so I'm sharing some data which I think is interesting and helpful to the ape community.\n\nI've noticed a lot of **newcomers that are scared of options** (probably due to massive losses\/gains posted by smooth-brained brotheren). However, once you understand the risks you're taking, options can be a powerful tool for both adding or reducing risk on your degenerate bets. You can continue to make degenerate bets if you like, but at least grasp what you're doing. \n\nFor this post, I'm going to assume *some* working knowledge of what options are, but here is link with a more basic explanation I wrote earlier: \n\n[https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/m1ahd5\/visualization\\_of\\_all\\_open\\_option\\_contracts\\_on\\_gme\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/m1ahd5\/visualization_of_all_open_option_contracts_on_gme\/)\n\n# Comparing MSFT to GME\n\nMy presumption here is that Microsoft is a stable stock where the option data trends are representative of the current state of the equity options market (or is at least is similar to other stable stocks. *Note,* *I dug through a bunch of tickers and this seemed like a reasonable assertion*).\n\n**An important note on greeks:** Looking at options in terms of the greeks is necessary to quantify how much they will change in value, especially if you're going to basket multiple options together or make complex trades. However, it seems like these statistical models may not always apply in highly volatile situations like GME. \n\nIf you're reading this and think the greeks are people from a country that makes dank meat dishes with yogurt based sauce, worry not because this information doesn't require you to really understand them. I am plotting purely in terms of absolutes. That is, **1.) How much does the option contract cost, 2.) How many people are buying it, 3.) How volatile is it?** \n\n**How do the price of GME options compare to MSFT?**\n\n[Absolute prices for the entire option chain of GME and MSFT. Options price behaviour is non-linear, making it difficult to trade based on tables\\\/numbers alone.  This was from last week, but data is collected daily. ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ipbfo81pjer61.png?width=11250&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb896e446c085da7b5ede7ca88160da4d62d7d5e)\n\nThe main take-away here is how much of a range there is with GME option prices that are out of the money. The other is how expensive GME options are. \n\nFor sake of just gaining an understanding of how options are priced, please understand that almost all option prices for most any stock will follow roughly the same trends and curves as above. This may not help us trade, but it will help you understand **why yolo'ing your savings on weeklies is a dumb idea.**  \n\n**No one is buying GME Options!!**\n\nIf you look at exactly how many contracts are out there, you will see that pretty much no one is buying GME. However, it does look like people are successfully selling way out of the money puts (probably purchased by apes on here). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Option open interest indicates nobody is buying GME options. This is likely due to their exorbitant cost and massive associated risk.](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/q3466ujtner61.png?width=12054&format=png&auto=webp&s=69c8590800ad6f0652cb7452173625f2e541448c)\n\nNotice how MSFT has a much more even distribution of puts and calls. People are betting both sides, and option strikes being bought are much closer to the stock price. \n\n**Implied volatility and why\/how thetagang makes money**\n\nImplied volatility or IV is a often not precisely defined quantitatively. It can be calculated using different options pricing models using an iterative method. However, for purposes of this writeup, you may think of **IV and demand interchangeably.** If an option has high IV, there is often corresponding demand. \n\nWhat is interesting is that IV is really high for options really close to expiry, even with Microsoft (i.e a stable stock). This would indicate that these options near expiry ***should be cheaper,*** but they're not. **There is a demand for (weeklies, FDs, yolo's whatever you want to call them)**. This would indicate that people are **buying these options to protest against sudden downswings** (historically this is the reason). **More recently, retail apes are treating weeklies like a casino**, which has likely compounded to even higher IV. \n\nThis phenomenon of high IV at extreme strikes seen for the upcoming expiry is known as the volatility smile. It was actually first notice after the crash in 1987, since people suddenly became terrified of flash crashed and began protecting themselves with cheap, way out of the money options. \n\nThetagang will sell these high IV options on a week-to-week bases to collect a small profit with a large amount of leverage (if not covered). It's also how selling covered calls can make you money. You risk getting burned if the stock price moves against you, but the higher the IV, the more upside there is to selling that option. You just go bankrupt of if you don't have the cash or stock to cover in the event things don't move your way. \n\nImplied volatility for both MSFT and GME show a volatility smile. Note GME is heavily skewed toward the out of the money side on puts, and the in the money side of calls. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/io2zsncfuer61.png?width=11250&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8cad59452807ab45e7ef7094373b7d23a402f9f\n\nNotice how GME is heavily skewed toward the out of the money side on puts, and the in the money side of calls. In my opinion, this is due to the market makers probably trying to gouge retail and\/or setting prices high to deter retail from purchasing GME options that they would need to hedge. The massive spread supports this opinion.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nGME options are expensive and some people appear to have made a tidy profit by selling way out of the money puts. This didn't require the long winded explanation given here to figure out, but I hope to have made some wrinkles in some ape brains.\n\nUse the information above, and please try to understand that options prices change non-linearly and is the reason why they feel like a lottery. Use the information above to more safely trade options (i.e. buy further out in time, expect the value of your option to drop in said time, buy closer to the money).\n\n***Most importantly, this is not investment advice. None of this is guaranteed to be accurate. Please do your own research and make your own decisions.***\n\nPositions: 100 shares of VXX and 100 shares of SQQ, getting absolutely hosed on both.

I know a lot of you have your doubts about Fintel but I have a membership account and I don't believe all the data should be dismissed.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised to see that a lot of hedge funds have not fully exited their position in GameStop.

Are other institutional investors starting to believe that the shorts are in trouble?

I believe that the hedge funds were coordinating an effort to surge the stock price and then drop it to deflate positivity about this stock. Unfortunately for them it did not work and GME quickly gained resistance at around the price of around 180. This leads me to believe that the available shares that they can purchase to influence the stock price is no longer significant enough to drop the price as drastically as before. \n\nEdit \\^ OR they do have enough shares to drop the price even lower but they figured out that the apes would just buy the dip.

When one buys losing options you are only benefiting the market maker. In this case it would be Citadel's Market Maker Division. Where do you think those earnings go to?

In the last two years, this loss has come down significantly. And what impresses me most about Gamestop is their cash on hand (currently $635M). Very few stores with operating losses have that level of cash. Most are in debt, and require the sale of shares to float by during rough times.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/dyyd0zf7req61.png?width=1544&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3e553bc397243f7b97702eb68d52d1a462c1431\n\nAnd this is the key misstep the HF\u2019s made in shorting Gamestop. There has been a stigma out there about brick and mortar stores going under (Toys R Us, and Sears as example)...  feeding frenzy, blood in the water you get the point. Sharks (HFs) have been getting more and more bold (reckless) in their targeting. Gamestop was the wrong target, for a very specific reason. It leases its stores. By comparison, consider Walmart needing to reduce stores, or Target. They\u2019ve built massive buildings with parking lots to house their very specific store needs (huge upfront costs, sunk), and they rent (or own) these buildings under much different contracts. They can\u2019t easily get up and leave one of their stores. Ask yourself, how would Walmart leave a store? Who would buy it? How could the investor renting to them turn it into something else? Maybe a city might want it to build an expo center. On the cheap. WalMarts costs are priced into this (it\u2019s expensive). They can\u2019t move as easily. Point being, Gamestop doesn\u2019t owe anything to shut down a store, it simply stops paying its lease and moves all it\u2019s stuff out. They rent strip mall locations and mall storefronts. This allows them to liquidate stores and downsize with little to no sunk costs. They can also reposition themselves much more efficiently. This is why we see this fast turn-around in Operating Loss last year (a major component of Operating Loss is storefront costs for Brick and Mortar). News of Gamestop closing stores isn\u2019t bad news. Remember that. The media will try to sell it as such.\n\nBecause of the focus, Gamestop is eyeing Digital Sales, for its future.\n\n# Chapter 2: Digital Sales Growth\n\nIt is clear to everyone, at this point, that Gamestop is looking to move a large portion of its business into the online space. In 2020 Gamestop did $580Million in sales online, and in Q4 alone their online sales represented over 34% of all Gamestop sales; Gamestop did more in online sales in the 4th quarter of 2020 than it did in all of 2019.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/80l9ei8breq61.png?width=1539&format=png&auto=webp&s=e16f718577f208643498038b3885b21f0e330092\n\nSo what caused this? Ryan fucking Cohen. And he\u2019s just getting started. When we see the sales in 2021 first quarter compared to 2020 the trajectory of this massive shift will become even more apparent. We have only to look at Chewy\u2019s online sales figures under Cohen to project what\u2019s to come for Gamestop in the next few years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/rg3g528dreq61.png?width=1565&format=png&auto=webp&s=c83e58af632d1e9cc06f4e1da6c7df5f9c371f5e\n\nThat\u2019s right, Chewy grew from $205M in online sales to $3,500M (17x) in 3 years under Cohen.\n\nGamestop Announced in it\u2019s Q4 earnings report last week what it\u2019s intentions are... *\u201cOur emphasis in 2021 will be on improving our E-Commerce and customer experience, increasing our speed of delivery, providing superior customer service and expanding our catalogue.\u201d*\n\nWhich brings us to our next chapter on the entire Electronics & Media space in ecommerce -- let's make sense of what potential exists for growth in this sector...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Chapter 3: Electronics & Media Sales\n\nIf you ever wondered where Amazon makes all it\u2019s money. Look no further than the category of Electronics & Media (Gaming, computers, electronics, digital media). In 2020 the company did 120.9 Billion in sales, and 54.6% of that fell into this category. There are plenty of other players in this space, but only Apple is close to Amazon\u2019s market share. Here is a chart to visualize the largest players (Gamestop is #10 currently with their 2020 sales, the tiny orange slice):\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/im8t7lwfreq61.png?width=1529&format=png&auto=webp&s=52e086ce497c34d9e352cfed9fce99f50d2ce723\n\nAmazon itself projects this space to grow 34.2% in the next two years. Meaning roughly $40B in new Electronics and Media sales will emerge in the online space for these companies to grow into over the next two years. Might be a good time to mention that Gamestop listed GPUs for sale on it\u2019s website earlier this week, and they sold out instantly. With Gamestop doing $580M in online sales in 2020, and most of that coming in Q4 it is safe to say Gamestop is positioned to grab onto this space in a way that will shake Amazon\u2019s growth models for the next two years. Have you noticed how Ryan Cohen is leaning on his Amazon (and Chewy) relationships to pull talent to go after this space. If chewy is any indication, I wouldn\u2019t bet against him eventually grabbing a large percentage, even the majority, of it.\n\nSo let\u2019s get to the fun part\u2026 valuation\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Chapter 4: What is Gamestop Worth?\n\nValuations are a funny thing. Companies are only worth what people think someone else will pay for it in the future. Often we start with fundamentals, but in the end, hype and excitement over growth and continued growth leads to higher and higher valuations. I\u2019ll start with a simple comparison just to prove a point.\n\nGamestop ($12B Market Cap) and Roblox ($36B Market Cap)\u2026 we\u2019re all gamers here, right? We know what Roblox is, right? Two completely different companies, but let\u2019s look at the figures anyway and then I\u2019ll get back to comparing GME to the online retail giants. Roblox did $920Million in revenue in 2020 (up from $435Million in 2019), and it\u2019s valuation rose from $4B to $36B. Hmmm\u2026 why? Well, it went public. IPO is a great way to hype a stock. Get people excited, maximize valuation, so those angel investors can finally get paid off. So how does this compare to Gamestop (minus the hype of an IPO). Well Gamestop did $6,466Million in revenue in 2020. Yep, seven times what Roblox did? So why the major difference in Market Cap? Well for one, Roblox has very few employees and no stores to spend money on (is this tickling that little feeling you have about Gamestop\u2019s move to becoming primarily an online ecommerce giant, it should be). If Gamestop were valued the same as Roblox, right now\u2026 it would move it\u2019s price to approximately $5,157 a share. That\u2019s not a squeeze number. That\u2019s simply an IPO hyped valuation number on growth. Gamestop is moving that direction, minus the IPO, but they are aiming to grow (like Chewy did).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ipbngvoireq61.png?width=1519&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a35214d7048744cd86debfee8cedda28b748b0f\n\nSo let\u2019s get a better comparison to the other giants. Apple, Amazon Chewy, Target, Walmart and Best Buy. I\u2019ve chosen these because they represent a wide range of Brick and Mortar vs ecommerce. Price to Sales Ratio is calculated by dividing the company's market capitalization by the revenue, this gives a general sense of how much the market is going to value a company relative to its revenue. Value players (like Buffet) are often looking for the lowest P\/S ratio to enter for a fundamentally solid company, and companies with a lot of growth potential and hype can grow their P\/S ratio (similar to P\/E ratio) to levels that are very high. One thing you\u2019ll notice in this chart. The more online a company is, the higher it\u2019s P\/S ratio can go. This directly impacts the Valuation of the company. While companies that may be online, but still rely most heavily on their stores, have a lower P\/S because they have a lot of overhead costs. You\u2019ll notice Gamestop in the middle, because it\u2019s transitioning to ecommerce. Last year you would have seen Gamestop with a P\/S similar to Best Buy and Walmart. The reason this is important is because as Gamestop grows it\u2019s online business, it\u2019s P\/S is likely to rise, and moving to the Amazon level would represent a share price of roughly double what we currently see for Gamestop, while not changing anything about it fundamentals.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Final Chapter: Conclusions\n\nOk you\u2019ve been patient, and I told you I\u2019d eventually get to what Gamestop is worth currently, and next year (projection). What the market hasn\u2019t caught onto yet, that we all see in Gamestop is it\u2019s deep fucking value. So what is Gamestop worth, right now?\n\nWell **$191**, that\u2019s what it\u2019s trading at. It\u2019s only worth more, when people see these numbers and get excited about them. The numbers show that Gamestop is growing exponentially with its online sales and Ryan has brought on a team to accelerate that growth. I don\u2019t know what Q1 numbers are, but I can guess a lot of Apes, are really excited about Gamestop, and becoming more and more loyal to its brand. I know I wouldn\u2019t buy anything from Amazon, that I could get from Gamestop right now, even if it costs slightly more. It\u2019s because of quality, and support for the brand.\n\nLots of things are increasing Gamestop\u2019s valuation, but growth of it\u2019s online sales will be the most significant one. What most analysts are ignoring (or simply missing, if I\u2019m giving them some credit) is just how massive Gamestop\u2019s online sales growth were last year, despite the pandemic. If we project Q4 numbers onto 2021, and ignored the dream team Cohen has brought on board, one can expect 3-4 times as much in online sales next year. That will tip P\/S higher and people will stop seeing Gamestop as a failing brick and mortar and recognize it for what it is\u2026 an Amazon killer, going after an $88B market in Electronics & Media by 2023. On top of that, growing an esports brand (I suspect) that will engulf a $200B annual industry that is likely to only grow to $300B by 2023.\n\nProject these figures onto Gamestop as you\u2019d like. I\u2019ll take a stab at it. Right now Gamestop should be valued at $662 a share, based on it\u2019s Q4 figures and projection into 2021 from it\u2019s finish in 2020 Q4. By this time in 2023, we will see Gamestop at a $50B valuation from $12.5B in sales, and a P\/S in the 4.0 ballpark - that puts it\u2019s per share price at $795 - conservatively without hyper on the growth (that you know will amplify that by another factor of 2-3). How do we justify a growth from 580M to $12.5B in two years\u2026 Ryan fucking Cohen is how. Multiple current sales by 17. Go back and look at that Chewy graph if you\u2019re wondering how that\u2019s possible. There is a gaping hole in the Electronics ecommerce side of the market, growing. Amazon and Gamestop can both grow incredibly without stealing from one another\u2026\n\nI have another DD in the works on The Squeeze (no dates, no times) and a look at how high we might go (spoiler, there is no accurate answer, but there is a lot to look at, and be excited about to try to make educated guesses).\n\nHere is a teaser\u2026 When Volkswagen Squoze, it temporarily became the most valuable company in the world. Gamestop doing the same, would put it\u2019s price north of $31,800 on it\u2019s way to the moon (not that we heard a bell yet as we flew by that mark).\n\nIf you needed one more reason to HODL, it\u2019s this\u2026 you will be at least 4 times richer a few years from now, even if you went into a Comma and your wife\u2019s boyfriend lost your password couldn\u2019t get to that sell button on the way down from the squeeze, because at $191 a share, GME is still a deep fucking value play squeeze aside.\n\nAnd if you\u2019ve ever wondered how Phineas and Ferb pay for their projects\u2026 I think I figured it out\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/28tift4lreq61.png?width=1303&format=png&auto=webp&s=105caf042c76cb6607783b29773e179b2bd1aa45\n\nPlease Be Good To Each Other Out There.\n\nBehind these names we are all humans and we all have our own stories.

We'll see if there's another attack if GME continues to go up. There is a Gamma Squeeze Threshold, but we don't know where that price range is at. If they attack again, it might tell us where the SHITs think that threshold is at.\n\nCurrent price: 224.04\n\n**11:31 Update**\n\nThank you to everyone for their support. I'm honored to be able to provide content that is worthy to you wrinkle brained Apes. I am trying to find a way to do this for a living. If I can make enough money on GME, I'm going to start an investment firm, hire some smart people to do research and analysis, and share all of that knowledge on Reddit for stocks y'all find interesting. I would continue to do live threads while managing an account for people who want the fun of WSB but don't know what they're doing.\n\nI'm currently planning on applying to Harvard so I can share all of their knowledge to you all so that Reddit can continue to become smarter investors.\n\nGME has stalled around 217. Though as I'm writing this update, I'm seeing a fast change in trajectory moving up so maybe it's moving?\n\nCurrent price: 218.85\n\n**11:08 Update**\n\nTwo small attacks, two small recoveries. They might be using smaller attacks to bring GMEs price down this morning. We may be at the start of a 3rd attack, so don't be surprised by another dip. They still haven't hit the Red yet, so we'll see if they accomplish that now.\n\nCurrent price: 215.96\n\n**10:40 Update** \n\nAnother attack. It started at almost the same price point as the other one. They're stratified with the stock been in the green though as they seem to stop before it gets to red. This tells me that they fear the Gamma Squeeze. They seem to be trying to avoid the 230 area. If we get there today, we'll see if that ignites a rocket.\n\nCurrent price: 214.00\n\n**10:16 Update**\n\nWe're almost top 25 here! I appreciate all of your support so far. I hope I can prove to be a post worthy to be near the top of this sub.\n\nThe attack is over and GME bounces back. GME is currently up 6% and seems to have some momentum. If they fire again though, that'll tell us if there's a price point they fear GME crossing. That's probably Gamma Squeeze territory.\n\nCurrent price: 220.96\n\n**10:08 Update**\n\nThis isn't a stall, this is a full on attack. SHITs apparently still have ETF shorts to fire. Unless they start driving GME into the Red though, those are just more shorts that need to be bought in \ud83e\udd37.\n\nThey could be trying to prevent a Gamma squeeze from happening. My dumb stab in the dark guesses that it would take pushing the price up to 250 or 280 to trigger a Gamma Squeeze, but these attacks might signal that that threshold might be a bit closer.\n\nI'll look closer and keep y'all updated.\n\nCurrent price: 220.00\n\n**10:03 Update**\n\nGME has stalled for a bit at around 220. Don't be surprised of this happening. The only way we go consistently up is when we hit Gamma Squeeze territory. For now, we have to rely on good old buying power. As shorts get covered, whales jump in, or stimulus checks start pouring in, we'll continue to see moments of growth sporadically throughout the day. Once we hit Gamma Squeeze territory, the engine should ignite.\n\nCurrent price: 219.14\n\n**9:41 Update**\n\nAfter a beating yesterday, GME comes out swinging out of the gate, flying upwards to 8% . GME is on SSR and they used a lot of shorts through ETFs yesterday, so I don't know how they stop this momentum.

Why weren't you on WSB?**\n\nI thought I got myself banned from WSB, so I made my comments elsewhere. I wasn't banned, I just had something in my post that forced it to get autoremoved. There is no conspiracy. WSB mods did nothing wrong. They reached out to me and told me they enjoy my comments. I'm just really smooth brained. I'm going to be more careful about what types of links I put in my posts.\n\n**Wow, you're really smooth brained, but where did you go?**\n\nMy fellow Apes, on Monday, I came to spread the good word, but found that my words were not heard. I figured that my time on WSB was done, so I ventured into other parts of Reddit to find a new home. What I found was a small city of wrinkle brained apes dedicated to GME. Their Daily Megathread recommended that comments like mine be their own separate posts, so I made my own post. Everything was normal, except for my new surroundings. Many of my usual apes were able to find me and I made some new ape friends along the way. I missed being on WSB, but I was content having a home.\n\nWhen I had a chance to check my surroundings, I came to learn just how smooth brained I was. I am used to crayons and bananas, but these apes spoke of candles and cups with handles. Many spoke with words that hurt my small brain, but they all seemed to be convinced that the reckoning was at hand. I spent my time reading and learning, trying to understand GME in a way I never understood before.\n\nI am still a smooth brained ape, but I hope that I can share some of the knowledge those wrinkle brained Apes taught me.\n\n**Corno4825, what did you learn?**\n\nSHITs can manipulate GME through ETFs. ETFs are essentially stocks that represent a collection of stocks. How this works is that there are people who will buy and sell shares of the stocks that comprise the ETF when someone buys or sells the ETF. The strategy involves shorting the ETF, but buying all of the stocks that comprise the ETF except for GME. The people who manage the ETF will sell the stocks including GME. The net change is that only GME is sold. It's complicated, but I've seen the math and charts and am convinced that this works.\n\nThat was the attack that we saw yesterday even though GME was on the SSR list. However, that ammunition is also limited and those shorts also have to be bought back in. With the recovery the GME made yesterday following the attack, I believe it is in a much stronger squeeze position strictly because of the amount of shorts that were used that need to be bought back in.\n\nThere are many wrinkle brained Apes that believe that the total shorts in circulation equal over 200% of the float. There is a lot of math involved which I do not understand, but many other wrinkle brained Apes agreed with the assessment. There was also a post from a Bloomberg Terminal that showed that Institutions by themselves held 115% of Gamestop shares.\n\n**Corno4825, what does this mean?**\n\n* Millions of shorts still need to be covered.\n* The SHITs are running out of ammo.\n* Stimulus checks still haven't kicked in.\n* Earnings report is coming next week.\n* GME is still up over $150 from where it was 3 weeks ago.\n* If you're still holding on after everything you've experienced the past week, what could possibly scare you now?","869":"Do we have ANY info, or is there ANY outcome, that is not favorable for us? [GME] Hello there, fellow apes.\n\nI'm here to ask a question that has been with me for quite a long time. The deeper we are with buying and HODLing $GME, the less I'm seeing reasonable bearish posts or comments about that stock (to be exact, I'm seeing none). I'm really trying my best to find any negative analysis on our fucking moon-rocket on WSB and other $GME-related subreddits and I'm not really finding shit. \n\nI've been reading many DDs, Technical Analyses, Discussions, you name it.\n\nFor example, this seems solid and explains much about short selling and why they shorted Geee Emm Eeeee in the first place:\n\n[https:\/\/iamnotafinancialadvisor.com\/discord\/DD\/GMEv10.pdf](https:\/\/iamnotafinancialadvisor.com\/discord\/DD\/GMEv10.pdf)\n\nWhat bothers me is this: Is this possible by mods deleting all the bearish stuff about $GME, or is it really that good? I mean ALL (99%) of bearish stuff can be found on CNBC, Jim Cramer's babbling and others, but here? NONE of that gets any recognition. All I saw here on WSB, was a post saying that we should keep putting pressure on them by buying options with a strike price closer to the current price, and just putting all we can afford in shares.\n\nIs it really a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and not pouring our whole savings in it is plain stupid? I'm a college freshman and I poured everything I can in it (that I can afford to lose), but is it worth just fucking pouring in EVERYTHING? If there's no bad outcome, except a fucking miraculous save by the government, or some DFV's evil clone appearing on the other side out of thin air, why is it not on the moon yet? Is it that people don't understand the stuff going on with GameStonk and that's the reason behind not going in? I'm seriously running out of ideas what could go wrong with that. \n\nAs far as I understand, the HFs are just kicking the can down the road in hopes for the company falling. They just keep shorting the company, bleeding money on paying premiums to their brokerages. Correct me if I'm wrong, but to me, that's like postponing the inevitable death! They're making it a fucking nightmare for who'll have to cover the shorts for them when they inevitably run out of money and the squeeze finally hits.\n\nI mean, what the fuck? It's that I'm not understanding something, or they are more retarded than the whole WallStreetBets community combined.\n\nAnd no, I'm not complaining about being a millionaire if it hits 100k, I'm here with my 6 shares and holding. (where I live a US dollar is 3.87 in our currency rn)\n\nTL;DR why can't I find any bearish posts on GME ANYWHERE besides the news? And we know that news are connected directly to HFs, so that's just bullshit and won't make any sense. I wanted to get some reasonable thesis about $GME not mooning, but no success.","870":"3\/17\/2021 GME Open Interest Report at Yesterday's Close of 208.14 I'M AN IDIOT. THIS IS JUST DATA THAT MAY BE USELESS. THIS ISN'T FINANCIAL OR LEGAL ADVICE. FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. *See* Disclaimer at the End of Post. \n\n**TL:DR:** **Buy GME this week for the POP next week.** As of yesterday's closing price of 208.14 and current open interest, 3.245 million shares are in-the-money for options expiring tomorrow. That is 6% of the entire inventory of GME shares out there. The pop will come next week when they will need to deliver on these shares by next Wednesday. The higher GME closes on Friday, the more it will hurt. \n\nSummary: \n\n1. Total Exposure to short positions on options is decreased slightly to **$2.5 billion** from $2.6 billion the day before--a 4% decrease. The share price went down by almost 6% so this is a slight **bullish** sign indicating that investors put  more money in ITM call options betting that the price will go up. *See* Figure 1 and Table 1. \n2. Exposure for just the the options expiring Friday is **$889 million** down from $924 million--a 4% decrease**.** This is another slight **bullish** signal--they think it's going up by Friday. *See* Table 1. \n3. The Number of Shares needed to cover all short positions on options decreased slightly to **11.6 million (21% of total float)** from 12.1 million (22% of float). *See* Figure 2 and Table 1. \n4. The Number of Shares (or equivalents) needed to cover Friday's short option positions--alone--is relatively unchanged at **3.245 million (6% of total float)** down from 3.394 million (6% of float). *See* Table 1. \n5. The \"Minimum Exposure Point\" for this Friday's options decreased to 150. *See* Table 2. This is a bearish sign in one sense because it indicates that our short positions on the options will do what they can to push the price to $150. This a bullish sign in a different sense because it indicates that money is going into calls such that the shorts on the options need to push the price lower to break even. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/wtv7voax6ln61.png?width=1368&format=png&auto=webp&s=da76d255fa895d29b253b22187d781680d719708\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/sqajs7507ln61.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6dddca60e9be57c4e70d23bce73d221502ff961\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/deg196o37ln61.png?width=587&format=png&auto=webp&s=22f72bcf496a037322580e2d705680dab89db88a\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/q5c3flv67ln61.png?width=518&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7f62411351adb0ce2224d22713f8c159797bb45\n\nLIMITATIONS\/WEAKNESSES\/BACKGROUND:\n\nThis is the result of a thought experiment asking a simple question: If a hypothetical single actor\/market maker was on the short side of all open options in GME, which means that he cannot simultaneously hold any long positions himself, what would that single actor's exposure be in terms of dollars? How many shares would that single actor need to find to cover all of the short positions?\n\nNote that this does not represent this market maker's \"loss.\" To sell an option, this hypothetical market maker received a premium as it does not take into account the premium the actor received for taking this short position.\n\nAlso, it also assumes that the actor has not already started purchasing\/selling shares on the open market to cover short positions.\n\nFinally, a major weakness of this curiosity is that, by its nature, it precludes the use of other long option positions to cover their short positions (since this hypo is set up with one guy being short on everything). In reality, we have multiple market makers who are constantly hedging themselves with other option contracts in the variety of neutral option strategies that exist for all options traders.","871":"THE EASIEST WAY TO CALCULATE GME SHORT INTEREST: AT LEAST 180.96% !!!(ZACK's DD 1) I post a DD yesterday and gained lots of comments in that post, however for some reasons, I was unable to reply the comments in that post!

Although I\u2019ve only got 6 shares in this GME roller coaster ride, I still consider myself an ape on the sidelines in this whole fiasco. It\u2019s been such a crazy last couple of months and I honestly haven\u2019t had this much (internet) excitement in my life. \n\nThis is the very first and only stock that I\u2019ve ever purchased and although I don\u2019t know shit about stocks (I understand the concept but that\u2019s it), this is something I\u2019ll never forget. I\u2019m happy for everyone who\u2019s lives have changed for the better and it\u2019s heart warming to see the good that this place does as far as charity. \n\nBut I\u2019m gonna be a negative Nancy ape for a bit. You guys saw it. You guys are seeing it. We\u2019re all watching it live. How manipulative media outlets are. How quick they are at shooting their arrows. How our government basically just gave us an amateur horse and pony show when they \u201cquestioned\u201d that Bosnian whatever the fuck from Robindahood. They tried to grill our boy DFV more than any of them. It really pissed me off watching that. \n\nThey tried throwing attention away from GME (silver anyone? lol). They tried attacking this place. They tried attacking day traders. They tried attacking DFV. They tried every single thing they could and failed. I truly believe it\u2019s because of the good intent in this sub that helped. That and you guys are seriously stupid as fuck. \n\nI mean, I know the cliche of \u201cnever trust the news,etc\u201d but to be watching it live is just....I mean fuck. If you can\u2019t see it by now you\u2019re obviously on the other side. Not only is no one going to be held accountable, more than likely they\u2019ll just change up the rules to punish the \u201clittle guys\u201d.

Stock price was \\~260 USD last week, and 800$ was \\~3x the stock price. When a strike price of 3x the stock price is so high for the MM that they don't cover their calls, THEN why should they cover those 200$+ calls when the stock price was 40$ three weeks ago. At 40$ Stock price a call of 200$ would have been 5x the stock price back then, and therefore WAY out of the money. So I really think there are a lot of naked calls expiring this Friday, so shit will hit the fan for the shorters when they become exercised.If there's some Pro here who can clarify the MMs covering process I'd be grateful.","875":"To all Hedgies and Apes **Hi Hedgies!**\n\nFirst and for most we would like to thank you for the wonderful dips. I am sure it was quite painful to watch each dip go up rather than down in your favor. Must be tough shorting a stock only to know now more have bought it and to cover is just going to take longer.\n\nHave you not learned? Honestly, even a retard can tell when you have nowhere to go. You are completely trapped in your own cycle of shorting the stock and hoping it has a sell off. Literally it is like a nightmare you cannot escape.\n\nThink about it, all you had to do was buy to cover. Seriously, it wasn't difficult the first time but you just had to make sure that the little lose right?\n\nThe little guys have been losing all their life, while you're used to seeing greens in your portfolio and thinking to yourself about how stupid the retards are for getting into a fair \"stock\" market and that anyone can become rich.\n\nI'm not trying to make you mad, I just think you are at this point; fighting a losing battle. I do however, sympathize with you. Only a little bit. You just haven't seen the amount of depression in your life yet to know that it is actually normal to actually lose money. In a fair market, that's how it should have been in the first place.\n\nThe thing is you should have covered when we said GME to $1000, honestly, this could have been the best decision of you life. You were losing peanuts to what you could have made back in 5 years or less with all that great manipulation. You were changing a few percentage of peoples lives for the better. It that couldn't make you feel better about losing money, then nothing will.\n\nBut seriously, instead you tried and mess with the massive amount of retardation that I haven't seen in years. You really don't know how millennials yet think do you?\n\nHint: WE DON'T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT ANYTHING\n\nNo matter how long it takes, you bet that no one is selling at a $1000 at this point. I don't think anyone will ever sell for the price you are going to offer.\n\n**Next my fellow retards,**\n\nHDOL! Nothing more left to say. Keep buying dips and wait. Just wait. It will happen. EVENTUALLY.\n\nNo time limit needed on how long it takes. We hold forever \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude4c\n\nRemember, if you are ever confused about anyone selling and leaving you behind, we are not. We are all in this together and we will come back for any retard that bought at $420.69 and beyond.\n\nMy blind senses are tingling. This is going to be one epic year.\n\nI can't wait to go to GameStop and let them take my games for $3 dollars and me being perfectly happy by getting screwed by them. Because GME is my baby and you never try to take our baby away from us.\n\nTO THE MOON. AND BEYOND. WHEREVER WE GO.

If you want to change that, I recommend you read the free book [here](https:\/\/www.elliottwave.com\/Free-Reports\/Elliott-Wave-Principle). But since I know that most of you are too busy eating crayons I'm going to summarise it quickly.\n\nA rare recording of Ralph Nelson Elliot's early days.\n\nAs you can see, our fellow \ud83e\udd8d Ralph already had a real hunger for tendies as a little kid. That hunger drove him to use his crayons on charts until he discovered in the 1930s that the stock market always moves in recognizable patterns back, so-called \"waves\".Simplified there are only two types of waves:\n\n1. Impulse\n2. Corrective\n\n**Impulsive Waves**\n\nThose are always waves that move the market and consist of five sub-waves because five is the smallest number of waves that can accomplish an overall movement.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/7zcxlzn7ohn61.png?width=535&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c7d5d431d351b8011ef4a5b4fa4fb123b4ee064\n\nImpulsive Wave on GME Weekly Chart\n\n**Corrective Waves**\n\nAlthough there are a few different corrective patterns we can say in general that they consist of three waves because that's the smallest number needed to achieve a retracement.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/bf1arfybohn61.png?width=382&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7503b533893b2ab4b05ddc4ac04df20675939cf\n\nCorrective Wave on GME Daily Chart\n\n*There are a few special cases, and obviously overall more to learn about it, otherwise, there would hardly be an entire book about it.*\n\nBefore we now take our colorful crayons and applied that mindblowing knowledge on GME there are a few other things you should understand:\n\n1. Each wave can and should contain waves in itself. \ud83e\udd2f I know... Sounds complicated, and often is, but to give you a simple example, in the 1-2-3-4-5 Impulsive wave above, you'd be able - possibly not on the monthly chart but on weekly or lower - to also fit another 1-2-3-4-5 between 2 and 4.This way you can confirm if your patterns are actually valid.\n2. Each 1-2-3-4-5 Impulsive wave is followed by a corrective wave. So, after 1-2-3-4-5, we see a corrective pattern like A-B-C. *(There are a few other corrective patterns but the basic A-B-C zig-zag is most common).*\n\nSo you are telling me that fellow \ud83e\udd8d Ralph knew how to predict the market almost 100 years ago? Sure...\n\nElliot Waves are highly accurate and in my opinion a great tool to predict what the market or a specific stock is going to do.\n\nUnlike most indicators it doesn't lack behind, however, there are still cases where multiple patterns could be applied and only once a few more candles are on the chart will it be clear which of those actually is correct.\n\nAlready during our first \ud83d\ude80 launch attempt that got canceled by RobinHood and others, I used Elliot Waves to estimate how far that rocket might go.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ktfxk4aeohn61.png?width=1544&format=png&auto=webp&s=aaadea58e519cfb08c76a483298b9d56e83ad4bb\n\nScreenshot using Elliot Waves on the GME 15 min chart on the 25th of January \n\nI shared that screenshot initially [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/l4syrd\/gme_megathread_part_2\/gkqko9z\/) and mentioned in a further reply once we reached that range that a drop in the range of $137-$207 will likely follow before our \ud83d\ude80 finally will launch to more than $4,000 per share.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/3iokow4gohn61.png?width=1552&format=png&auto=webp&s=d721faa86a85d269ba2f45abd2ac9194b467f6ec\n\nWhat actually happened after that \"prediction\"?\n\nAs you can see both statements were highly accurate and IMHO only because of buying restrictions did the drop go further than it should have and our \ud83d\ude80 take-off was canceled.\n\nIf you can follow so far that's great... if not, I really recommend that you use the time while we wait for take-off to read the book about Elliot Waves.\n\nOK, but how come that $10,000 per share is now just a stop along the way?\n\nWell, by preventing the launch back then HFs fucked up IMHO and now more people are buying tickets for their trip into space. After all, Elliot Waves are in simple terms nothing else but the manifestation of human behavior on the market.\n\nHowever, the beyond average manipulation (preventing buy orders altogether) also makes it harder to say with absolute certainty that the following pattern is accurate, but since they anyway only reflect my opinion I'm still going to share them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/q26p6lmkohn61.png?width=1782&format=png&auto=webp&s=50290f8fe34fb0e2cd1fb6f58c8c06fc81a6b67f\n\nUsing my new crayons on GME hourly chart.\n\nThe way it looks right now we are currently in a corrective wave 2 (see 0-1) that is developing as an A-B-C pattern. Both of those aspects show a correction into the current range, although we haven't reached the predicted range for C in the A-B-C pattern (and maybe won't, but I wouldn't be surprised if the price falls into the range of $131-$161 to confirm both predictions and possibly also close the gap that's still open from the 5th to the 8th of March at $140.50).This would mean that we are likely at the end of wave #2 within a 1-2-3-4-5 Impulse.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/vpssstgmohn61.png?width=1854&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a82de9fedbea728b56c48befb504dfbb90ee00b\n\n\ud83d\ude80 Pre-Launch\n\nNow, the projection for the following wave 3-4-5 looks like this and already gets us into the range of $10,231 to $13,382 - at which point we'd see a corrective pattern (A-B-C), which IMHO is very likely since a few \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\ude4c bitches would likely sell their shares at that price and HFs obv. will also try to create a drop at a price point like this to make it appear as if the MOASS is already over.\n\nHowever, as mentioned earlier, each wave consists of waves, so the 1-2-3-4-5 Impulse you can see in the image above is actually just wave #3 in the bigger 1-2-3-4-5 Impuls that began during the all-time low of GME. Confirming the highlighted pattern, and also confirming that we are likely going to see a correction\/retracement\/sell-off at that level. And that Corrective pattern would be wave #4 in the bigger Impulse, and after that, we will see our \ud83d\ude80 fly. It's hard to say how far right now, but personally I expect to see $130k per share, possibly more.\n\nNow, as said, all of that is just my opinion and not financial advice.\n\n**TL;DR IMHO GME will go short-term to around $2,000 at which point we'll see a small retracement and then we'll move to our pre-launch stage at $10,000 per share, followed by a drop to as little as $7,000 per share, followed by the \ud83d\ude80 take-off to $100,000 or more per share. I learned all of that from a very old ape called Ralph Nelson Elliot that used his crayons in interesting ways.**","877":"When there is max pain there is max profit. I posted a DD about the potential gamma and short squeeze on RKT last night. Here\u2019s my update after today\u2019s fuckery. \n\nReal quick disclaimer. I get hype in my posts because that\u2019s what I provide; excitement, facts, and encouragement. I\u2019m doing this because sometimes we need to vent together and re-evaluate the game plan. I get up at 4am every morning, pop an addy and hope for the best\/expect the worst. This is why I\u2019m hype, take it or leave it. I also don\u2019t have a job right now. I used to sell mortgages and made a lot of money so now I fucking work my ass off to learn everyday and make a living day trading. Not financial advice.\n\nFirst, let me discuss the elephant in the room. We were so fucking close. RKT was pushing and flagging and ready too moon after its third attempt above 27. That\u2019s the most frustrating part. There was no volume after that so I repositioned lower when I saw the whole market tanking, not just RKT. Here we go again...The VIX (volatility index) has been below 20 this week and bears have raped meme stocks taking advantage of this. I\u2019m sitting there getting pissed off because it\u2019s like every boomer out there needs to suck J. Powell\u2019s D Thursday before deciding if they like a stock or not. They bow down until hedgies decide what they want to do....pussies. Fuck em. The opportunity was there and some wales got in today for sure, but not enough. WSB also didn\u2019t help much because a majority of you think RKT is a distraction from GME. If we just broke 27 we were going to rocket this stock to Mars. I was getting mad at my fellow apes because I imagined you guys sitting there with your dick in your hands waiting for your stimi to come in, and knowing that most of you didn\u2019t know how close we were. It was right there. Then I saw something.\n\nThe whole market tanked AS SOON AS GME WENT GREEN. It\u2019s comical honestly. Gme is basically a new index. It\u2019s like citadel called in friends to sell their positions before we mooned it. \n\nHere\u2019s my take on RKT and GME for the rest of the week. It all depends on the markets reaction to j Powell. The bond and inflation worries have been hurting tech stocks and RKT. My guess is that he will say the same shit as last time...we\u2019re not raising rates. Ok well does the market tank more? I don\u2019t think so. I think will see a sharp decline prior to j Powell then a recovery. That\u2019s my hope. Today\u2019s sell off lacked volume. It was artificial IMO. Hold on to your horses, it could get bloody, but there is always sunshine at the end of the tunnel unless the companies go bankrupt which they won\u2019t. \n\nIf RKT can bounce back above 26 then we\u2019re right back in the game. Again, there really weren\u2019t many sells until panic overcame the paper hands. Just need wales to get their j Powell fix first and stimis should be clearing banks tomorrow too. If the market is slow and not moving then bears have more power. We need to help make it move. \n\nIf the market is slow I would by some calls for longer expirations while they are cheap. That\u2019s the great part of downward volatility - cheap calls. \n\nLet\u2019s finish the week off positively. We\u2019re in this together. Not financial advice I just like the stock and it\u2019s undervalued as shit.","878":"Give me a chance please TLDR; why all of the hate between AMC\/GME? It's not us vs them. It's the average Joe vs the rich\n\nI know I may get banned or laughed at, and this doesn't exactly follow the rules (sorry) but it needs to be said. I have one share of GME that I bought at ~$40 a few weeks ago. I have around 200 shares in amc with about 15 options as well. The thing I don't get is all fo the hate between the two. People saying GME is dead. Or AMC is a distraction. If you truly do your DD you would see neither is dead and neither is a distraction. \n\nAMC is better because it has a cheaper buy in. GME is better because it has a higher target for share price. But none of that matters. Either one of these is sending a message. It's giving the middle finger for 2008. It's calling out the manipulation. It's saying enough is enough. \n\nHating each other causes AMC AND GME to lose. Not one single \"retail investor\" should be hoping the other fails. Because if either AMC or GME wins, the hedgies hurt. If both win\/squeeze, the entire economy\/country and possibly even the world will change. This isn't just about stocks anymore. This could be the  largest (and due to the new DTCC rule, possibly last) transfer of wealth the world has ever seen.\n\n Yes I'm sad I was to late to join GME to begin with, but it isn't done. I'm in AMC now. And if AMC pops first, as soon as it's done I will come support my brothers and sisters in GME 100%. If it pops after, I'll still be rooting. If  AMC doesn't ever pop, I won't be angry at GME. And if GME doesn't pop ill be there to welcome them to AMC. \n\nTo me, this isn't about apes vs apes vs hedgies. This is people that have been put down, oppressed, and she ved to the side, vs people who (for the most part) got lucky, and designed this whole system to keep them up, and us down. \n\nSo support AMC, support GME but most of all support your fellow human who is going thru this as much as you. Who has problems like you do. 6 months ago, all of the shit that is being said about AMC now, was being said about GME. \n\nApe together strong, but more importantly, Common people together, supporting each other, can change the entire world.","879":"Apes Read this post by u\/ChristianRauchenwald \"Why $10,000 per share is just a stop along the way...\"  **EDIT #5 (others at the bottom): Thanks for the awards, but unless they are free use your money to invest in a stock you like.

But since I know that most of you are too busy eating crayons I'm going to summarise it quickly.\n\nA rare recording of Ralph Nelson Elliot's early days.\n\nhttps:\/\/reddit.com\/link\/m6mkl8\/video\/vsm22l8l5hn61\/player\n\nAs you can see, our fellow \ud83e\udd8d Ralph already had a real hunger for tendies as a little kid. That hunger drove him to use his crayons on charts until he discovered in the 1930s that the stock market always moves in recognizable patterns back, so-called \"waves\". Simplified there are only two types of waves:\n\n1. Impulse\n2. Corrective\n\n**Impulsive Waves**\n\nThose are always waves that move the market and consist of five sub-waves because five is the smallest number of waves that can accomplish an overall movement.\n\n[ Impulsive Wave on GME Weekly Chart](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/1vuhwi4n5hn61.png?width=535&format=png&auto=webp&s=04cb758cc44e447e13e8362cce604c11bd12085d)\n\n**Corrective Waves**\n\nAlthough there are a few different corrective patterns we can say in general that they consist of three waves because that's the smallest number needed to achieve a retracement.\n\n[ Corrective Wave on GME Daily Chart](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/tz9lls9p5hn61.png?width=382&format=png&auto=webp&s=01894662f90ac0d8e184b0d53749adafc7944245)\n\n*There are a few special cases, and obviously overall more to learn about it, otherwise, there would hardly be an entire book about it.*\n\nBefore we now take our colorful crayons and applied that mind-blowing knowledge on GME there are a few other things you should understand:\n\n1. Each wave can and should contain waves in itself. \ud83e\udd2f I know... Sounds complicated, and often is, but to give you a simple example, in the 1-2-3-4-5 Impulsive wave above, you'd be able - possibly not on the monthly chart but on weekly or lower - to also fit another 1-2-3-4-5 between 2 and 4.This way you can confirm if your patterns are actually valid.\n2. Each 1-2-3-4-5 Impulsive wave is followed by a corrective wave. So, after 1-2-3-4-5, we see a corrective pattern like A-B-C. *(There are a few other corrective patterns but the basic A-B-C zig-zag is most common).*\n\n#  So you are telling me that fellow \ud83e\udd8d Ralph knew how to predict the market almost 100 years ago? Sure...\n\nElliot Waves are highly accurate and in my opinion a great tool to predict what the market or a specific stock is going to do.\n\nUnlike most indicators it doesn't lack behind, however, there are still cases where multiple patterns could be applied and only once a few more candles are on the chart will it be clear which of those actually is correct.\n\nAlready during our first \ud83d\ude80 launch attempt that got canceled by RobinHood and others, I used Elliot Waves to estimate how far that rocket might go.\n\n[Screenshot using Elliot Waves on the GME 15 min chart on the 25th of January](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/11kyqyv46hn61.png?width=1544&format=png&auto=webp&s=1dec899ebec3a26559848da7a73b3e0aff094162)\n\nI shared that screenshot initially [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/l4syrd\/gme_megathread_part_2\/gkqko9z\/) and mentioned in a further reply once we reached that range that a drop in the range of $137-$207 will likely follow before our \ud83d\ude80 finally will launch to more than $4,000 per share.\n\n[What actually happened after that \\\\\"prediction\\\\\"?](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ghttkcd76hn61.png?width=1552&format=png&auto=webp&s=1fd51527a0311b975640fe30d2aa07c4720a3b1b)\n\nAs you can see both statements were highly accurate and IMHO only because of buying restrictions did the drop go further than it should have and our \ud83d\ude80 take-off was canceled.\n\nIf you can follow so far that's great... if not, I really recommend that you use the time while we wait for take-off to read the book about Elliot Waves.\n\n# OK, but how come that $10,000 per share is now just a stop along the way?\n\nWell, by preventing the launch back then HFs fucked up IMHO and now more people are buying tickets for their trip into space. After all, Elliot Waves are in simple terms nothing else but the manifestation of human behavior on the market.\n\nHowever, the beyond average manipulation (preventing buy orders altogether) also makes it harder to say with absolute certainty that the following pattern is accurate, but since they anyway only reflect my opinion I'm still going to share them.\n\n[Using my new crayons on GME hourly chart.](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/aehej23b6hn61.png?width=1782&format=png&auto=webp&s=65e68b932cde18ea852691290e7e8300bacedb4a)\n\nThe way it looks right now we are currently in a corrective wave 2 (see 0-1) that is developing as an A-B-C pattern. Both of those aspects show a correction into the current range, although we haven't reached the predicted range for C in the A-B-C pattern (and maybe won't, but I wouldn't be surprised if the price falls into the range of $131-$161 to confirm both predictions and possibly also close the gap that's still open from the 5th to the 8th of March at $140.50).This would mean that we are likely at the end of wave #2 within a 1-2-3-4-5 Impulse.\n\n[\ud83d\ude80 Pre-Launch](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/jf5g20sc6hn61.png?width=1854&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd207b34169180baa9573f43a85b88ff66a3d019)\n\nNow, the projection for the following wave 3-4-5 looks like this and already gets us into the range of $10,231 to $13,382 - at which point we'd see a corrective pattern (A-B-C), which IMHO is very likely since a few \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\ude4c bitches would likely sell their shares at that price and HFs obv. will also try to create a drop at a price point like this to make it appear as if the MOASS is already over.\n\nHowever, as mentioned earlier, each wave consists of waves, so the 1-2-3-4-5 Impulse you can see in the image above is actually just wave #3 in the bigger 1-2-3-4-5 Impulse that began during the all-time low of GME. Confirming the highlighted pattern, and also confirming that we are likely going to see a correction\/retracement\/sell-off at that level. And that Corrective pattern would be wave #4 in the bigger Impulse, and after that, we will see our \ud83d\ude80 fly. It's hard to say how far right now, but personally I expect to see $130k per share, possibly more.\n\nNow, as said, all of that is just my opinion and not financial advice.\n\n**TL;DR IMHO GME will go short-term to around $2,000 at which point we'll see a small retracement and then we'll move to our pre-launch stage at $10,000 per share, followed by a drop to as little as $7,000 per share, followed by the \ud83d\ude80 take-off to $100,000 or more per share. I learned all of that from a very old ape called Ralph Nelson Elliot that used his crayons in interesting ways.**\n\n**EDIT #1:** I started learning the Elliot Wave Theory last year. Two predictions I published last year based on Elliot Waves were the [A-B-C correction in TWLO in October](https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/chart\/TWLO\/JJ2castF-Twilio\/) (although my floor for C was a little too low) and wave [3-4-5 for TSLA and the $2,000+ price target in July](https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/chart\/TSLA\/iTTc7EjH-Tesla-Going-for-2-000\/) (unfortunately, the stock split ruins the replay, but you can check the chart for yourself to see how accurate my predictions were)\n\n**EDIT #2:** Since some of you are asking if all of that even applies during a squeeze I looked for a chart of a recent short squeeze and if you take a look at [https:\/\/prnt.sc\/10neu61](https:\/\/prnt.sc\/10neu61) you'll see that the TSLA squeeze in 2019 also follows the 1-2-3-4-5 Impulse wave pattern.\n\n**EDIT #3:** In addition to \"EDIT #2\" to prove another point, take a look at [https:\/\/prnt.sc\/10nezpr](https:\/\/prnt.sc\/10nezpr) and you'll notice that wave #3 of the TSLA squeeze by itself is another 1-2-3-4-5 Impulse wave.\n\n**EDIT #4:** [https:\/\/prnt.sc\/10nh43c](https:\/\/prnt.sc\/10nh43c) shows the weekly GME chart with Elliot Waves from the low last year until now and also indicates that we are currently in wave #3 that will take us to $9,193 - $10,805 followed by wave #4 (short drop not visible in the screenshot) and our final take-off with wave #5 (also not in the screenshot).\n\n**EDIT #6 (#5 is at the top): Here are a few things I personally won't do:**\n\n1. **I won't try to trade those waves, but simply HOLD because I don't want to risk missing the take-off because those price levels aren't set in stone or guaranteed.**\n2. **I won't sell on the way up but wait for the top and sell on the way down. Because the price could go way higher than predicted and I rather sell at 80% of the top on the way down than selling at $100k per share** [just to see the top at $1,000,000 or higher](https:\/\/prnt.sc\/10ni1ei).\n3. **I won't invest money that I can't afford to lose.**\n\n**EDIT #7:** Updated link in Edit #6 to include wave #5 prediction on GME weekly chart.

Dark pools are private exchange for trading securities that are not available for the investing public, this form of transaction keeps the identity of the parts secret. This process of trading is legal, but it has a loophole where it can be used for fraud and market manipulation. This function allows \u201dnaked shorting\u201d by borrowing shares from someone who owns the shares and duplicating them by putting the synthetic shares back in the market without the duplicate number being noticed, which creates outstanding float discrepancies. Discrepancies on time to deliver shares happens because of settlement periods, these processes are common and part of the market in large. But intentional \u201dnaked shorting\u201d when shares are not available and instead of synthetic shares are released is illegal. \n\n\n\n**How does this happen?**\n\n\nAlternative trading mechanisms (ATs) are algorithm trading bots used by institutions (brokerage -clearing firms, other trading venues, etc.) to process large orders at a lower risk. These transactions are made by HTFs (high-frequency trading) which process large numbers of trades in a manner of milliseconds. \n\nThe reason why ATs were designed is to avoid market volatility, large transactions can induce volatility if they are placed all in once. ATs bots, called Traderbots, distribute the shares in parts as they see fit in the market using dark pools, a hidden process, to limit disruptions on the price by prematurely revealing the positioning of large investors and institutional clients. But the mechanism of dark pools does also presents a potential conflict of interest between trading companies and their affiliates. \n\nAt first, ATs and their regulations were designed to trade shares in form of \u201dblock transactions\u201d around **10k** to **500k** in size, these transactions are charged a lower price fee than the average market pays for because of their size. That is fundamentally why ATs exists, this system is regulated and there is nothing illegal about it. The problem is when institutions use these ATs for manipulating the market. Namely, in the attached article, as \u201d*toxic*\u201d market participant (bad *behavior* by market makers). In a data research, attached in the paper, it was discovered that instead of \u201cblock transactions,\u201d where large amount of trades are made, the number of shares that are regularly exchanged are on average of **181 shares** per transaction.\n\nThere is no transparecency in the way how markets institution and affiliates uses ATs, if they don't get caught it is discretionary to *them* to check the wrongdoing.\n\n_**Here is Barclay\u2019s disclaimer piece**_ from their analysis misuse of dark pools, which they were fined and apologized for:\n\n\u201c*The analysis also determined that the trading venues to which Barclays routed unfilled orders (after first having routed them to its dark pool) tended to be venues hosted by high-speed trading firms, \u201c[n]one of which*,\u201d recalled one Director, \u201c*had a reputation for being favorable to clients from an execution perspective.*\u201d Those venues included Knight Capital, Getco, and Citadel.\n\n*These clients, sited above, is anyone who uses brokerages firms, meaning anyone who trades independently (**YOU**) or not in the market.*\n\n\n_**How these companies uses this leverage and create a toxic market participant behavior?**_\n\na) front-runs transactions, \n\nb)  void regulation, \n\nc)  sell securities short without borrowing (referred to as naked short sales by the SEC), \n\nd) constantly enters orders it intends to cancel for the purpose of spoofing the market, \n\ne) layers trades on top of each other not intending to execute them, but as a means to control the marketplace pricing (price suppression),\n\nf) virtually provide services on demand for its clients regardless of whether they are operating legally or not, what Shitatel provides for HF like Melvin Capital.\n\n*Does that sounds familiar???*\n\nA lot of institutions uses ATs in smaller fractions traded on a millisecond speed-when you see your level ll and \u201dtimes and sales\u201d charts running so fast that you can't track the numbers; that is what we are talking about. Or large body or very long-tailed candles out of context with the overall price action; that is HFT as well. There are many ways how institutions can use this algos to manipulate the market and when they don't have the shares, they borrow from someone else creating a synthetic (fake) share. That is when the number of shares doesn't add to the outstanding float.\n\nThe author of the paper went a step forward saying that \u201dATSs and dark pools are in essence, a *private market*.\u201d\n\nThe idea is that these forms of trading by High-frequency traders such as Traderbot using dark pools, when misused, harm price discovery altering the fundamental functioning of the capital markets. \n\n**How is this becomes illegal?**\n\n\u201dIf dark pool operators route client trades to a cooperating third party and then become the other side to those trades, then dark pools would be acting for their benefit as opposed to protecting their institutional client and providing a fair and efficient market. Moreover, this hypothetical scenario would constitute illegal pre-arranged trading in violation of a number of securities laws. This would clearly be against the public interest, the protection of investors, the maintenance of fair and orderly markets and is contrary to the spirit of Regulation ATS and the anti-fraud provisions of federal law.\u201d\n\nWhen a share is sold by a market maker to an institution, then to the investor by the same Traderbot that operates from the clearhouses to it's affiliates is where transparency lacks and it\u2019s intent can become malicious practices. Where can be short sales not backed by borrowed assets, a.k.a. \u201dnaked shorting\u201d sold for full price and incooporated to the ATs operator\u2019s books (not sent to NSCC\/DTCC for clearance and settlement). Which results in undisclosed securities positions and numbers exceeding the number of shares security has on their total float. Such as we see in GME, AMC and other heavily shorted stocks. It\u2019s one of the techniques that shitty HF uses to hedge themselves in the market.\n\n**Why is important to understand this?**\n\n\nThis process of naked shorting is recurrent in GME. At every \u201dfail to deliver\u201d the shares have have been duplicated to cover the one's prior to it (if I understood correctly). Once there is no available shares to borrow from the limited float of the stock HF are creating more and more counterfeit shares to hedge their positions and keep profiting. While preying on the collapse of the stock. Which they will benefit and leave with millions and millions of dollares. HF tactics is to drive the company into bankruptcy, after all once that happens no one will care to count the shares. HF will take the profits, so it doesn't matter for them to repeat the process until they have active success.\n\nIf you having read it yet, [check this](https:\/\/iamnotafinancialadvisor.com\/discord\/DD\/GMEv10.pdf)  from u\/gafgarian\n\nAs long as prices remain higher, this tactic not only become a major economic risk for HF but it increases the potential of GME short squeeze. Eventually, they have to deliver their shares and get out of the market.

While some short sellers appeared to cover their bearish bets in recent weeks, a short-selling expert says he still sees plenty of squeeze potential.\n\nShares were down 19% to $178.12 around 10:30 a.m. Such levels are still many multiples higher than the stock\u2019s one-year low of $2.57.\n\nIhor Dusaniwsky, managing director at short-selling analytics firm S3 Partners, told Barron\u2019s on Monday that his firm estimates about 8.98 million GameStop shares (ticker: GME) were recently sold short, about 16% of shares available for trading.\n\nDusaniwsky said over the last month, his firm has seen about 7.5 million shorts covered, meaning bearish investors bought shares to cover their bets. The bulk came over the past week, when 4.6 million shares were covered.\n\n\u201cGME shorts are going through a short squeeze, and the stock continues to be on of the top stocks in our short squeeze potential metric, which means the squeeze is probably going to continue if its stock price remains at these levels or higher,\u201d Dusaniwsky added.\n\nThe company\u2019s shares rocketed higher last week following a company announcement that Chewy co-founder Ryan Cohen has been chairing a board committee aimed at transforming the retailer into a technology business. Cohen joined the board with two associates in January, kicking off GameStop\u2019s parabolic ascent.\nGameStop said it will report fiscal fourth-quarter results on March 23. Analysts expect adjusted earnings of $1.35 a share, up from $1.27 a share in the prior fiscal fourth quarter, according to FactSet. Of course, analysts are far more bearish on GameStop than the retail investors posting on Reddit\u2019s WallStreetBest forum. The highest price target listed by FactSet is $33, while the mean target is $14.64.\n\nI would also like to receive updates and special offers from Dow Jones and affiliates. I can While near-term results could cool off the GameStop rally, those excited about the stock are looking far into the future. If the company provides upbeat color on its e-commerce efforts and the impact of the new gaming consoles, it could make a quarterly miss more palatable.","885":"GME, has anyone considered this possibility...Cohen ace in the hole? So Ryan Cohen originally purchased his 12.9% stake in Gamestop at $8.43 per share average.  Based on the current price, this is about a 2300% profit.  \n\nPer his contract as a board member, he cannot own more than 20% of the company, leaving him with 7.1% company stake remaining he is able to purchase, or roughly 3,900,000 shares.\n\nSo let's say he sits and waits till this Friday, when MMs continue to move the price toward 155 (current calculated max pain price for options on 3\/19).  He then files a 13F, and buy's up 3.9 million shares...this would still put his profit average well over 1000%, AND would blow MM's attempts to pin the price out of the water, triggering a gamma squeeze...this creates massive margin calls by Tuesday 3\/23, which coincidentally happens to be when GME reports earnings.  The convergence of these two factors in addition to hype momentum ***could be enough*** to then trigger the MOASS imo.

I haven't been posting. I lurk on Reddit. I don't post. I do read, however, despite having the comprehension of an ape. The content I've been consuming - the personal stories, the wrinkled-brain analysis, the memes - has been amazing. This truly is a unique community - it's global, inclusive, and (by and large) supportive. It's a great resource for those, like myself, who have jumped into the market with little understanding. GameStop piqued my interest. This community has helped refine that interest into understanding...well, maybe just an interest in one day understanding at least some of what's going on. So, as an ape who has been lurking and learning, I thank all you apes -- from Cornelius to Zaius, from Grodd to Solovar, and of course King Kong himself, DFV -- you apes run the spectrum, and are on the spectrum.

I was asked to write up the recent relation between ETF's and the GME dip's we've been witnessing in the last several trading days.* ***I have included a TLDR for the crayon eating apes with an attention span of a 2-month-old dog.

Feel free to DM and I'll respond in 10-15 working days (jk)\n\nHedge Funds covering up $GME shorts through ETF cloaking\n\n*I would like to present a few common terminologies before starting this post which may aid in helping you apes comprehend this more clearly.*\n\n**Exchange-Traded Funds (ETF)-** An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a type of security that tracks an index, sector, commodity, or another asset, but which can be purchased or sold on a stock exchange the same as a regular stock. An ETF can be structured to track anything from the price of an individual commodity to a large and diverse collection of securities. ETFs can even be structured to track specific investment strategies. You can consider them as a hybrid of mutual funds.\n\n**Short Selling-** Short selling is the process of selling shares that you don't own, but have instead borrowed, likely from a brokerage. Most people short sell shares for two reasons:\n\n1. They expect the share price to decline. Short-sellers hope to sell shares at a high price today and use the proceeds to buy back the borrowed shares at a lower price sometime in the future in a bid to profit.\n2. They want to hedge or offset a position held in another security. For example, if you have sold a [put option](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/p\/put.asp), an offsetting position would be to short sell the underlying security.\n\n**Authorized Participants -** An authorized participant is an organization that has the right to create and redeem shares of an exchange-traded fund (ETF). They provide a large portion of the liquidity in the ETF market by obtaining the underlying assets required to create the shares of an ETF. When there is a shortage of ETF shares in the market, authorized participants create more. Likewise, as ETF borrow costs increase, APs are less likely to borrow shares to hedge their position, and more likely to fail-to-deliver.\n\nIn a typical transaction, the borrower of a stock posts collateral of 102% to 105% of the shares' value in cash, government securities or a bank letter of credit. If the ETF needs to sell the stock, it can recall it from the borrower. But if the borrower for any reason isn't able to deliver the shares, the ETF is repaid through the collateral instead, although that can have adverse tax consequences for the ETF.\n\n**$GME relationship: Let's look at the past trend of an ETF with GME**\n\nNow I'm not claiming today's red day was entirely due to etf's being shorted or their shares being lent out, but there is significant evidence that leads me to believe this may be one of the key factors.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Notice how the assets plummet suddenly after the first short squeeze?](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ge6epulq4bn61.png?width=688&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b84a08585e0d2b57f4cab485d2ae0b466c42605)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*By law, a fund can have no more than one-third of its total assets in securities on loan. Few ETFs or other funds ever reach that ceiling, and ETFs are considered to be more conservative lenders than other funds. Market makers are continually creating new ETF shares (by presenting the fund with a basket of securities represented in the ETF) and redeeming others (and getting the underlying securities in return), so the number of ETF shares outstanding fluctuates. Because the supply isn't fixed, there really is no impact on performance when an ETF is net short, industry participants say. The prices of ETF shares typically stay very close to the value of the underlying holdings.*\n\n***ETF shares borrowed today saw significant lending.

They can also legally disguise their short position via synthetic longs, and there's concrete evidence that they have done this on the various articles posted before.\n\n**When coupled with synthetic longs via options, gives the appearance of shorts covering when they haven't, takes GME off the threshold security list when it shouldn't be**, and provides the ability to naked short GME again. This was the missing piece of how GME could actually be shorted without appearing so. This solves the NYSE threshold securities issue and the ability to drive GME down outside of buying a put.\n\n**Ultimately they have to cover these shorts sometime or another, if the ETF's recall their shares back that would mean an absolute fuckery of melvin and citadel, given they are still paying massive SI without the numbers actually showing up the threshold index**.\n\nThe Link Between Failure to Delivers and ETF's\n\nETF's are a growing force in financial markets and constitute almost 25% of US equity trading volume, therefore please keep in mind that not all shares shorted with specific ETF's are directly linked to GME. The one's I used as evidence is either because $GME is a major part of their portfolio or the ETF is retail orientated.\n\n**Failure To Deliver -** A condition where two investors agree to the purchase\/sale of a security at a given price but the seller fails to deliver the security in a timely manner.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The daily volume of Failure to deliver traded in the past](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/h7263a5f4bn61.png?width=588&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7576c75223e5ddf8959093fafaea48d12586046)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ETF's being shorted in the past](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/kw9k81jg4bn61.png?width=801&format=png&auto=webp&s=976a2e44cdd6327ed13ee81021e913ae02c6ad0f)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nComparing both charts depict how the recent increase in Failure to deliver has had a direct correlation with ETF volume being shorted. Point being? The finance industry has used ETF's as a way of covering up their Failure to deliver's way before $GME. \n\n**Authorized Participant Arbitrage Option: Operational Shorting**\n\nWhen faced with \"excessive buying\" pressure as we have witnessed with $GME, Authorized Participants and Market may sell shares as \"Naked\" and then locate or create the shares at a later time (up to T+6 for bona fide market making). However, delaying past T+3 results in a failure to deliver **but AP\/Market Makers are allowed to fail past T+3 because they are \"making markets\" and have an additional three days to settle trades (a total of T+6). This choice of shorting can also lock in a profit if options are used to hedge their exposure but with less capital outlay.** I won't go too in-depth about options hedging in this post because I want to keep the topic on the point of ETF's. However, I see a lot of misconception regarding calls and delta hedging which leads to misinformation being spread.\n\n**TLDR**\n\n**Do NOT WORRY about the price decreasing, this is all synthetically created to kick down the eventual outcome down the road through lending ETF shares and recent data proves that**. **Over 3.5 million shares were lent out through etf's yesterday and their failure to deliver's are accumulating each and every day. It's like maxing your credit card to pay off the debt on your other credit card. Does it solve the issue? No. It only delays it and makes it worse. Secondly, there is no volume to back up the current dip and just goes on to show you how this is all synthetically created to spread FUD. People who cheer for GME being put on the Shortlist need to realise that has no significant impact as hedge funds have other ways or artificially decreasing the price.**\n\n**Can't stop, won't stop.

Keep in mind, ALL TA requires volume to play out how it should. We haven't had any volume on GME in over a week.\n\nHolding shares simply isn't enough - needs constant (all day every single day) buying of shares and IN THE MONEY options.\n\nIf you buy options that are 20-30% in the money they literally can't price pin because they can't get and keep the price 20-30% below current market. So you force immediate share buying by market makers to hedge, and virtually eliminate their means of counter-attack which has been price pinning at the point of maximum pain (price at which most contracts expire worthless).\n\nIf you are intending to help push the squeeze, buy shares throughout the day every day. If you are playing options, mostly buy calls in the money. If you're buying OTM calls, buy as close to current price as you can afford. The more imbalanced OTM calls are, the more they're just going to price pin at maximum pain. They literally cannot do this if there is a ridiculous amount of new ITM call interest that they have to buy shares to hedge.*\n\nEssentially, we cannot rely on normal technical indicators for movement with Gamestop. There are two major reasons. \n\n1. Manipulation. We cannot do anything about this really, aside from buy and hold. Technicals actually have a tendencies to work in reverse when a stock is being manipulated at these levels. The shorts, while stuck in a stupid position, aren't stupid. They know when the TA is indicating a bullish setup, and that is the best time for them to attack the stock to break the setup.\n\n2. Volume. All technical setups require volume to play out. If volume doesn't follow, the technical setup fails and the price action is unpredictable. Except in this case, it goes down because it's being shorted at every chance.\n\nSo what do we need to do? Hold? Yes. But that can't be it. If we are doing nothing but holding, this will be a stalemate that they will probably win as sections of retail gets bored or impatient. They can literally hold us in a stalemate for months\/years if volume never shows up to move the price. *Yes, they pay more interest the longer they have to wait. They'll just manipulate other sectors of the market to force gains and cover their losses unless the SEC steps in to stop market manipulation.* \n\n#Volume\n\nWithout volume, there is no endgame. Look at every day we've had spikes. Look at the volume. Now look at the past week or two. We aren't making progress because nobody is buying shares, aside from some whale algos that are simply fighting off the short attacks. Believe it or not, the whales do need retail support to force the squeeze. The whales are the ones creating momentum from time to time. If it catches on, they can follow it up. But if they just go all out to create a surge and nobody follows behind them to buy, they are literally risking billions of dollars to fail.\n\nThis thing will likely happen in waves over the course of a few days. If you look at any day, there are surges in buy volume, but they're short. That's likely a whale, testing the market. If they see confirmation\/follow-up from the market, it's less risky for them to send a second wave of buying pressure. So it will be something like, whale buy, retail confirmation buys, whale buy, runaway effect, gamma squeeze and then finally short squeeze. All of those things have to happen consecutively, fluidly and fairly quickly to beat any kind of counter attack.\n\nNow this is going to sound counterintuitive, but in order to catalyze the squeeze, we have to stop just buying the dip. When volume picks up and the price is spiking, that's the most important time to buy. That's the point when additional buying pressure is most important. And until the retail market confirms pressure on one of those spikes, we are going to keep bouncing back and forth.\n\n#Options\n\nThe other side of the coin is options purchases. **Stop devoting the majority of your capital to far OTM lotto tickets.** This helps the short positions, because it forces the market makers to help the shorts. Market makers that sell call options have to hedge their risk. When you buy an $800c, it does two things.\n\n1. They don't have to buy very many shares up front to remain risk neutral.\n\n2. In incentivizes the market makers to pin the price.\n\nYou can do some additional reading on max pain price in options, but it is essentially the closing price at which the largest number of options expire worthless. When you buy OTM call options, you're increasing the maximum pain price, which makes it easier for market makers (and shorts) to pin the price there.\n\nIf, however, you're buying a ton of ITM call options, you're doing two things:\n\n1. Deep ITM calls have a delta of essentially 1.00. This means that in order to remain risk neutral, the market makers essentially has to buy 100 shares immediately upon selling you the contract.\n\n2. It lowers the max pain price by creating an imbalance towards lower strikes having the most OI. This means in order to pin the price at max pain, they would need to drop it from it's current price.\n\nNot only do you force market makers to be risk neutral immediately (meaning they don't care where the price goes), you also force them to immediately put buying pressure on the stock price.\n\nIf you must buy OTM calls, buy ones that are at least closer to being ITM. The further OTM you buy calls, the more likely the price will go sideways. You can also sell calls and roll them into higher prices to remain leveraged as the price increases. Once it achieves a runaway squeeze, which will be easy to identify, you can start buying your lotto tickets.\n\nTl;dr: In my opinion, if you want to help catalyze the squeeze, you need to buy shares when the price is spiking and buy calls that are at least 10-20% in the money.\n\n\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf16","895":"Retail can't used Stimmys to buy stock until Wednesday when they get deposited.

They won\u2019t just let GME moon, \ud83e\udd8d have to force their hand. All weekend, aside from creating a WSB Zoo, (which is great and thank everyone who contributed). We had people celebrating this is the week. I\u2019ve saw those comments over and over all weekend. If I\u2019m seeing it, so are the hedgies. March 19th has been marked on our calendar for weeks. EXPECT THE WORST CASE SCENARIO! \n\nIf this was poker, we are literally showing our hands before we go all in. The hedgies are seeing our cards and folding just to prolong this squeeze.\n\nWe just need to continue to be patient and buy what we can afford and most importantly HOLD! \n\nThe numbers are on our side. All they are trying to do is cause fear and doubt. They NEED OUR SHARES!\n\nThis is not financial advise, this is \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83e\udd8d advice.\n\nEdit 1: So I\u2019m been getting a lot of comments about me being a shill, hedgie, bot, etc... So let me end this retardness\n\nYes, I joined Reddit 41 days ago. The same day Mark Cuban came here to chat with us. I like some apes here bought GME in January out of fomo. I saw the stock go up and then crash down to the 50s. I\u2019m usually a low risk stock trader, but I saw an opportunity to \u201cget rich quick.\u201d When I saw my portfolio go red for the first time ever, I was panicking, like wtf is going on. I knew RH and other brokerages restricted us from buying which led to the dip, so I HELD. So when I saw Mark Cuban on here and he told us to \u201cHOLD!\u201d I felt reassured. Since I created a new account and joined wsb, I thought to browse through all the post and memes. Here I saw stories of how people were effected in 2008, and their parents lost their homes due to these 1%. I saw stories of how people have been poor or barely making ends meet have this once in a lifetime opportunity to turn their life around. I\u2019ve seen stories about expensive medical bills, rent, buying a first home, and other necessities, how this opportunity can change their lives. I seen stories about just wanting to get their tendies so apes can buy a lambo. All these stories really touched me and changed my whole perspective about life, stocks and this short squeeze. I originally bought these stocks for the money, but now I know it\u2019s much much more. It\u2019s NOT about ME, it\u2019s about \ud83e\udd8d. APES STRONG TOGETHER! And anyone else who doesn\u2019t agree with this movement and only cares about their money, you\u2019re just a selfish paper hand to me. So the past month and a half, I took the time to learn, learn about stocks, options, shorts, GME, etc... because I believe in this stock and I was to help others. I know firsthand how it feels to be a newbie and buying due to fomo and seeing the stock dip. So I\u2019m trying to help and educate the fellow apes as much as I can, because every ape is important no matter how many shares they hold, because there\u2019s more than one way to help the cause than buying.\n\nSo some of y\u2019all can continue to criticize me, I really don\u2019t care. I\u2019m going to continue to help and educate others.\n\nFinally if that story isn\u2019t convincing, IF GME CLOSES AT LEAST $350 on FRIDAY, I will eat a Green Crayon. \n\nHopefully that convinces the naysayers that I\u2019m a \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83e\udd8d!","897":"SEC Failure to Deliver data for Second-Half of Feb PT3!

I've got a kid to feed, you know. So I've been here looking to make some money alongside the rest of you apes, and I was willing to take the risk. When GME dropped to less than 50 only a week after record highs, I knew things were not over. So I bought in and have been happily watching the gains these past few weeks.\n\nThing is, I wanted more. With the price so high, I was looking at Options. I was looking at GME a week ago. It was trading at 138. I went to buy a Call Option at 40 with a strike price of 140. Let's say I sold it at a price of 280. That option would have been 10k in the money! Unfortunately I have to say \"would have been\" because I did not buy that option. Not because I didn't want to, but because I wasn't ALLOWED to do so. What gives? The little guy can't get access to real trading strategies? Wall Street has to screw us over like that?\n\nI mean hey, I understand having to ask for approval first. Accept the risks and all that. So fine, I did that. Robinhood gave me a big FU. Fidelity, which has been my brokerage app, said I needed to wait a few days. On Friday I was told I got approved. Awesome. All good now, right? OF COURSE NOT! I'm a little guy, so the only position I am entitled to is being screwed.\n\nThis week I decided to start small, grab one Call on AMC with a strike price of 12. The price just hit 14, so that option was about 200 in the money. Nice start. Needless to say, I went to buy the option and was denied. Oh sure, I had been approved for options trading. Buy only at Level 1, which paradoxically doesn't allow you to actually buy options. Does that make sense to anyone? Don't ask me for experience, assholes. You're creating a Catch-22. How can I ever get experience if you won't let me try?\n\nIf anyone knows a place with enough integrity to give the little guy a chance, I would love to know.

I've been DOING some technical ANALysis recently (fractals and shit), and found out that GeeMEeee is going to fking PENETRATE $1K next week. Hope you enjoy the read! Yeah, you heard it right, and you most likely know that already, but lemme give you some technical rationale of how this might happen. The analysis is build upon fractal techniques, so that the previous price action is used for making this forecast. Buckle up and eat a Crayon, fellow trader (the word is used as anagram you know for what) as it will help you stay nutrated for the rest of this reading, and it might even help you with the digestion (of the information in the post).\n\nThis is not a financial advice and I am not and a professional advisor, I just enjoy to share my knowledge and educate brainless apes occasionally.\n\n\"BuT whY dO I neEd your FARTCAL ANALizis?!1\"\n\nWell, that's a good question. When I was a young ape living free in the Steppes of Kazakhstan... JK, leave poor Vlad alone for a moment. **The fractal** (from Latin *fractus*) means a steady scalable design of irregular shape emerging on any data. The trade fractal in the financial market is the pattern, formed by a sequence(es) of candles, which has peculiar identifiable characteristics and a tendency to reoccur across different scales and time-frames. Fractals are simple yet important, repetitive formations used by traders to identify and to confirm a trend. Apely speaking, fartcals allow us to forecast the future price action based on the previous similar trends on a given trading instrument.\n\nNow that the captain is gone, let's get to business.\n\n[GME fartcals wroom wroom](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/yge17n3k12n61.png?width=2160&format=png&auto=webp&s=d533ec1fdbcf6443b2233142f87bb285f0c27786)\n\nI know that you all love Crayons with all of your hearts, so I will use rare turquoise and magenta ones in this analysis. Furthermore, I did my best to simplify the method of distinguishing the fractal sequences, using simple lines, and hopefully you should need no more than one brain wrinkle to understand it.  \nWhat you see on the chart (one candle represents 2 hours of price action) above is a perfect example of beautiful fractals. The chart starts from the 11th of January with the turquoise slightly downward tilted consolidation. Next you see a relatively soft magenta upward impulse (14-16 Jan), followed by another turquoise consolidation, this time slightly tilting up and lasting for about three days. Next is where the things really start to get interesting (22nd Jan), as the subsequent magenta upward impulse accelerates exponentially. This accelerection does not go quietly, erupting into a powerful gap (not as big as the one in your head, though). Finally, starting 27th of Jan we have a local endgame highlighted by a purple rectangle with the apex (pay attention to this peak, as it will be used for calculations later) on the 27th of January. 'What? Why purple rectangle?' you may ask. Easy. REKTangles are the Horsemen of the Endgame.  \nThat was only the left part of the chart. Now let's be brief for a moment. There were six main components to the fractal base: turquoise consolidation, magenta uptrend, turquoise consolidation 2, magenta impulse, gap and purple rectangle. What you see on the right, is the original base for the fractal described above meets its bigger brother. Particularly, starting 22nd Feb a very similar chain of price actions manifests. And this is how we really utilize fractals: identify the fractal sequence from the previous data (on the left), and after that apply the pattern to similar market conditions (on the right). Many of the the things look really similar on both sides of the graph, don't they? Coincidence? I think not.  \n\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/v5s6clts12n61.jpg?width=534&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f7e6dcacd9509becc15e1e38a254575986e49063\n\n\"Oh fArtcaLs good Butt WEN MOON?1!\"  \n\n\n[Here you go boy](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/f0u97sfv12n61.jpg?width=461&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d64f1f93399d094112b49cf4170475e56ce84bc8)\n\n  \nAllrighty.

What I need you to do now is what even a half brained chimpanzee is capable of. Count to six (yes, you may use your fingers). Twice.\n\n[Numbers and fractals simplified for dummies](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/mfnkdif022n61.png?width=2160&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d2fd1b92e9a7bf6c2bbeb0fac0ed538ea35d96b)\n\n1 = flat line;  \n2 = small magenta hill;  \n3 = line as flat as your wife's girlfriend's tit;  \n4 = accelerection;  \n5 = your brain (aka Gap);  \n6 = Valhala REKTangle \/ GME go BBBBRRRRRRR  \n\n\nGood boy\/girl, you've come this far.

So I ate a pack this time, and I am full of GMEnergy. As is the chart below, so bullish, that we will definitely see some GMEnergy explosions in a short time to come. Now the complexity of analysis is going to increase a little bit, but the apes have to evolve at one point in history, so I really encourage you to use this opportunity.   \n\n\n[In-depth fractal forecast](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/888zsh3c22n61.png?width=2160&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec2c553761a27dc98efa7dae3de918da0d4f600f)\n\nI hope that you got accustomed to the previous six steps for dummies explanation, and by this moment you should understand the basic principle of how the fractals play. What you see above is a little bit more advanced chart, through which I aim to explain how I came to the price predictions in the post title (finally!). Ok, 1 2 3 4 5 6 is understandable, where did A B come from? The first and most important notice, is that A-B fractals are built upon 1-2-3-4-5-6, and on the chart you can see that A measures 1-2-3-4 pattern, while B covers 5-6 steps of the sequence. A-B on the left (January run) is self explanatory, the fractals are measured as they are. A-B on the right (current price action formation) is where we need some math to get involved, particularly, when we are working with the new B movement prediction. And that is not as difficult as it may seem from a first glance. Again, the main fractal property, re-occurrence, will play on our side. Predicting the price movements, on a volatile market like this one, is one of the most ungrateful things to do, so don't go too harsh on what I am going share with you, apesters. My theory, is that it is possible to predict the amplitude of the upcoming move, using data from previous one. And here, we only need the coefficient from first A-B move. A simple ratio: dividing first B move (about $325 increase) by first A move ($131) gives us a coefficient of about 2,48. Let's apply this ratio to the currently forming fractal: that is multiplying the second A fractal completed height (about $330 based on my prediction, which is built later in this post), which will give the estimated B part of the second fractal height of about $818, landing us on the sweet $1200 dollar level through the next week. Boom, looks beautiful and promising! Fractals, baby!  \n\n\nI hope it has been an entertaining as well as mentally developing read for you so far, smoothie-brainie. But there is still one important part of the analysis left to be addressed. Particularly, it is the the sequence part number 4, where the price action stands currently. And yeah, you guessed it, almighty fractals are helping us here again. Below you will find two charts (both are 30 min charts), which are actually zoomed in the price actions of the fourth step of the two fractals analyzed above. I can't stop enjoying and appreciating fractals and below you should really see why.  \n\n\n[GME price action 22-27 January](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/heozo1gg22n61.png?width=1646&format=png&auto=webp&s=d637c1806d229ffad089dc6491357ce01b55207a)\n\n[GME price action 5-15 March](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/m1dydccm22n61.png?width=1646&format=png&auto=webp&s=9724902e12d23390a6f614fe026acd4f2c4abf3d)\n\nBecause they look similar again! Now I will ask you to excuse me, I started to work on this analysis about ten hours ago, and I really need to get some sleep, as my brain is holding strong to the last wrinkle it has left, so this explanation will be brief. I forecasted the apex point of the current 4 using not so complicated method, and again taking inspiration from the previous price action and its underlying patterns. The magenta curly lines play as supports for both of the impulses. And these look amazingly similar in its slope and pace, but we should probably stop being surprised about that at this point. The second important fractal factor is this chainsaw in the middle of the patterns, corresponding to the severe corrections in these bull runs. Remember being in the market at those moments? Wooh, that was fun. And finally, take a look at this averaged line that looks like a string of a bow - not only it averages the price action, it also completes this bow shaped fractal pattern, allowing us to predict the potential high of the current price action ($380-ish). That's it folks, mic drop.\n\nTL;DR: Fractals is life fractals is love  \u2764\ufe0f  as is GEEEMEEE","901":"Regarding \"retail has no power\" - Numbers, data, a reality check, & why you're wrong.

Nothing is from \"I saw someone say that..\" the info is from various sources on google. Please do your own searches on any info you doubt. The points remain the same even with a few percent differential. This is strictly to get a realistic view of retail power.

[This article](https:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2021\/01\/29\/investing\/china-gamestop-investors-intl-hnk\/index.html) doesn't have sources, but it points out how global GME went. There's many more articles like it, for plenty of countries. Europe, India, Asia are several places I saw people trying to get in on the action. \"China\u2019s approximately 200 million retail investors trade more often than any other investors on Earth\u201481 percent said they trade at least once a month\" [From this article](https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2015\/07\/09\/three-charts-explaining-chinas-strange-stock-market.html)\n\n*Let me remind you that a stock like GME as of today has estimated between 27m-40m shares in the float, and a market cap of 18.4B at today's price.* **Retail has no control my ass**. Lets take a look at this:\n\nA graph of apple users versus apple price from robinhood's API in 2020, going up to 8\/6\/2020. They stopped offering this information via API at this date.  We can ignore apple price here, we're looking just at ownership.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Source: Robintrack.net](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/1xji566rn1n61.png?width=1633&format=png&auto=webp&s=202fbbb95234ba5a1a6ae13453c992879805b25e)\n\nThe above shows on 8\/6, 730k RH users owned Apple. That's 5.6% of users at the time using their 13m users number, which the total user number I would speculate is a bit lower at that time, as they grew from 10 to 13m users in 2020. RH stopped their API showing this info, so 8\/6 is the most recent you can get on any company.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGME was the most popular stock on RH, so I find it reasonable to believe at least 5% owned it, most likely WAY WAY more considering the global exposure this got. Once again, RH average account size is $5k. Please do the math here of how Jan may have looked. **This is ONLY on Robinhood**. Of course this is speculation here, but I feel that it's pretty reasonable. It's speculation based on prior data. & if users really are 23m, that's even crazier. Here's math below about what GME could have looked like. This is based on 13m users. Then, **add all of the other brokers**. This chart is only robinhood. You get the idea. Realistically, *other* brokers ownership percentage probably isn't *as* high, but it's still going to be way up there, especially during the GME phenomenon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|If average # of shares per person is|% of RH users that owned the most popular stock|Total shares owned on RH|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|5|730k shares|\n|1|10|1.46m shares|\n|5|5|3.65m shares|\n|5|10|7.3m shares|\n|10|5|7.3m shares|\n|10|10|14.6m shares|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyways, moving back to the more broad discussion and no longer focusing on GME.\n\n\"The **total market capitalization** of the **U.S. stock market** is $50,808,508.7 million(over complicated way of saying $50.8T (12\/31\/2020)\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Source: https:\\\/\\\/www.nasdaq.com\\\/articles\\\/who-counts-as-a-retail-investor-2020-12-17](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ludljsdtn1n61.png?width=1003&format=png&auto=webp&s=1cd3e4113641f443d002de2dde95913532440a47)\n\nIt appears our estimates line up pretty closely with other data. *Notice how mutual funds are SEPERATE here.*\n\nSo why does retail \"not control the market\" ?\n\nPersonally, I disagree with this statement. Retail does control the market. **Then why is there a narrative that retail doesn't control the market?** Two main reasons in my opinion. Yes, this is speculation based on data. Form your own conclusions. Here's insight into mine.\n\n1. Retail isn't coordinated. Even though we collectively own over 1\/3 of the market, we can't coordinate things like the elite can. We can't dump 1 million shares all at the exact same time to tank a stock price. We can't control the media narrative because we don't own\/aren't in bed with the media, so we lose some influence here. Retail doesn't control the day to day action on a stock, but retail controls it from a broader sense. *One raindrop cannot cause a flood, but continuous raindrops over an extended period of time do*.\n2. Information **IS** becoming a commodity, there's just so much shit and misinformation to sift through right now, it's difficult for most people. Retail gains more and more control every day through decentralization and increased freedom of information on the internet. *They ARE terrified of retail*. The potential for \"power\" to shift back to the people out of the elites hands is higher than ever with the advancements of tech. I could write a whole paper on this concept. I believe decentralization is the future for everything. Information, politics, money, stocks, etc. It is imperative for the elite to keep this knowledge away from the people. Knowledge is power. Poverty and education are linked significantly. Keeping people in the dark and unaware of their capabilities is an extremely powerful tool that has been used to suppress people since civilization began.\n\nI know above points might sound a little bit over the top, but these are my opinions based on data. I'd be happy to engage in talks around any of these points. There may be data that is just plain wrong, or that I misinterpreted. Please poke holes in anything.\n\nEdit: \/u\/alice_oe made this data point \u201cI use the European broker eToro, they have 20 million users and their app currently shows that 9.49% of them holds GME. In January this number was around 15%.\u201d \nHeavily supports my points made, felt like it\u2019s important.","902":"The Vix is Swelling and has a pattern just like the one before march 2020 crash Don't freak out if a market crash occurs in the next couple of days or week, the Vix has been swelling the past couple of weeks in a pattern similar to the one before march 2020.\n\n**Hedgies will time their short sell attack with the market crash to make us think GME is going down with the rest of them, in order to make us sell.**\n\nIn reality GME, has the opposite behavior of all the other stocks, and we have witnessed that.\n\nHODL.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ugylljmvv0n61.png?width=1623&format=png&auto=webp&s=0dc150f2198ec1d7a21d4b0a2c20ab150d0d5adb\n\n \n\n**Not financial advice, I'm just an ape that eats crayons as a full time job.

Thank you to everyone on this community and especially those who have done some incredible DD over the last couple months. This has been one hell of a roller coaster ride. I\u2019m proud of you \ud83d\udc8e hands that held through Wednesday. \n\nI believe in both the gamma and short squeeze. The recovery from last Wednesday and to be holding this price integrity with such low volume in the last couple trading days has been encouraging. I obviously would have liked to see more of a bump on Friday 3\/12 to trigger the heavily bought expiring 300 call options. \n\nIn reviewing all the DD, I\u2019m really only questioning two things, of which only one can be answered. \n\n1. I\u2019ve seen a lot of calcs on the actual number of naked short shares needed to cover. IMO - These numbers vary significantly and with the resources available is probably only conjecture and to be seen upon the conclusion of this squeeze.\n\n2. MY MAIN QUESTION (AND REASON FOR THIS POST). We know Melvin was down 53% in January due to the first GME squeeze. They testified before congress these shares were covered. Citadel and Point 72 since have invested $3 billion in Melvin with an agreement for future revenue sharing. Why would they open themselves up to this type of capital exposure to a firm who\u2019s teetering on the brink of bankruptcy? Especially if the intent was to double down and short GME again to recover these losses. Wouldn\u2019t Citadel and Point 72 been better off letting Melvin fail and taking their own capital and shorting GME? I know the CEO of Melvin used to work for Citadel, but I just struggle with this ideology. Furthermore the SI (short interest) in GME has fallen by 50% since the first squeeze in January (correct me with exact numbers).\n\nAgain, I\u2019m long on GME and not trying to be a FUD... But if anyone has thoughts on how these hedgies operate, please enlighten my poor ape intellect!\n\nSee y\u2019all on the moon!

It is entirely your money on the line. Personally, I have a very specific goal in mind with $GME. I am in at 22 shares at about $222. I stand by this movement, for many reasons, and for those who bite that potential loss in the name of change I honestly salute you.\n\nBut the nature of the market is there will always be bag holders. I accepted this risk, you accepted this risk. In the coming weeks, please take DD with a grain of salt and do not let people influence your own plan of just instinct. I let myself get cooerced into buying it at around 340 a share like the degenerate I am; I lowered the average because I personally believe in the company long term, squeezes aside. But this decision cost me a lot. While I could cash out this very moment for profit, had I waited even a week, like I wanted to initially, I would have gotten in at not even half that lol. If you are in this for the squeeze, keep that goal in mind and don't let paper hand jokes and peer pressure make you commit horrible decisions with your finances. At the end of the day, a million people may cheer you into bankruptcy but I doubt a single one will stand by to lift you out of it. Regardless of $GME, $AMC, meme stock or a fucking boomer stock, you need to put yourself first above everything else.

Sellers OVERWHELMED buyers and the price tanked $140.\n\nAsk yourself for a moment why a holder of stock would ever want to get the least amount of money for it? If you wanted to sell stock you would sell it gradually so as to not 'spook' the market. You would want the price to remain strong while you un-wind your position.\n\nThere is only one explanation for what happened: a massively co-ordinated short interest attack to inspire fear and simulate a Bank Run (when the average investor loses confidence in the Church of GME and fears the price is in free fall).\n\nThey're trying to create a positive feed-back loop of fear where eventually YOU sell your shares.\n\nThis strategy of 'dumping' massive amounts of shares is, as everyone knows, VERY COMMON. It's why you see the after-market tank. It's why you see the pre-market tank. It's why you see an EARNINGS BEAT and then the shares DIVE OFF A CLIFF. It's shorts trying to inspire a panic.\n\nWhat's very interesting about this short attack was that it was obviously massively coordinated. There are MANY shorts in GME and they are all acting, to some degree, independent based on their cost-basis and level of exposure. Some shorts may actually be switching their positions to go long.\n\n[In my post here I explain why GME could be legitimately valued at $500 a share.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/m35u61\/memeageddon_judgement_day_witching_day_march_19th\/)\n\nThis attack on March 10th reveals that there is a MASSIVE WHALE that is cornered and willing to dump billions to get out.

This may co-incide with a Short Attack to make it look like people are cashing in.\n\n**Important price 6: $483 - THE ALL TIME HIGH**\n\nAs the all time high is approached many 'smart retards' will think to sell before other people start selling. Everyone is seeing that goal line and it may create more selling pressure as we reach that peak. There will also be less retail buying at these levels since who wants to buy at the peak. The only buyers will be the shorts covering which would just keep pushing the price up IF they get called and or are covering.\n\n\\*\\*TLDR:\\*\\*There are at least 6 important price milestones at which shorts may attack next week and DUMP a lot of shares for sale in a short period of time.

Is there a return ticket from \ud83c\udf15 \ud83c\udf15 \ud83c\udf15?\n\nHow do you think this all plays out? \n\nMy own guess, based on nothing but the fact that I used to hold my breath a lot when I was little: it\u2019ll be manipulated for years. There\u2019s so much money sloshing around GME that there\u2019s not going to be any one real level. It\u2019s going to bounce around like your one sketchy cousin who somehow drives a Porsche.","911":"There are more retail investors than ever, but we don\u2019t have the power to tank markets. I saw a post of a person nervous that the economy is going to tank because of GameStop. This individual\u2019s mind was so manipulated by the media that she truly thinks retail investors are the reason for GameStop and the possibility of a recession. The post was insulting against the common people, and it was extremely na\u00efve. We can help the cause, but as you saw today and yesterday we certainly cannot move it or else we would have. All we do is help bullish institutions by HodLing a stock that we like. \n\nI also see a lot of articles saying that retail investors are essentially the cause of hedge funds losing money and 401(k) stocks just doing their average thing. Meanwhile we\u2019re making 100%-300% returns because we see past the bullshit and don\u2019t trust the system. This is infuriating to me and I don\u2019t think it gets a enough of attention. Gme dropped from 348 to 178 before I could take a snapshot of my gains...yeah we don\u2019t have that type of power. We have a different power...buy and hold a stock we like. \n\nThere are some really smart apes on WSB here and some really dumb apes. We don\u2019t have the ability to pum* GME, we just make it A LOT harder for you to dum* it. The reason for that is because we are fearless and re*arded and we like the stock. We have learned not to panic sell (more of us at least).\n\nMy point is figure it the fuck out and stop patronizing over 9 million people by telling the public that we are some godly entity with extreme power. If you\u2019re out there hedgies please listen: figure out your own problems that your own greed got you into and stop crying on live television. The only difference between retails then and now, is that we see right past your lies and are more aware of how to make money. We just do it legally. \n\nThree years ago no one thought a retail investor could be, not a force in the market, but a CHANGE in the market. What really grinds my bananas, is the fact that it is the billionaire hedge funds job to adjust and pivot to the macro level of market changes. All we do is buy and hold. You\u2019re telling me that these dumb hedgies can\u2019t figure out a way to legally work with that? Then they were never qualified to be in that position. \n\nGME made us woke. Now you have to figure out how to make money rather than manipulating the public with articles released 10 minutes before the price action actually happens. We will hold through your fomenting and your petty ass $1 price target downgrades to justify movement in the stock. \n\nThink about it...their argument is don\u2019t let retail investors trade because it makes our job harder. It\u2019s harder because they were less informed back then than they are now. We have to stop giving them freedom. It wont work....since we have social media to spread real truth. No way to hide information like they used to. If somehow they do find a work around that it would have to be done illegally and unconstitutionally. They cant take that route because it would be planet of the apes part seven or some thing.","912":"GME and how my wife's girlfriend is my EX. TLDR:Buy GME low, sell GME high. Get paid many times over the next year.\n\n\nMany a DD has been posted discussing the numbers behind the price changes in GME. I have read a number of them and it's one of a few reasons that GME will pay me twice. However, I have seen very little discussion on something that should be shouted from the goddamn rooftops. Something that would mean GME might pay me 10 more times.\n\n* Collusion!\n\nNo self respecting media outlet will ever publish an article on hedgefund collusion. While I have seen comments here and there about price manipulation and short ladder attacks, almost no one in the media is talking about how several HFs are acting as a group right now. \n\n\nMy first premise for this belief is based on Melvin capital receiving a cash injection from Citadel.  In what world does a professional financial institution look at another professional financial institution, that is bleeding money, and say, \"you guys just lost a shitload of cash, here have some of mine in exchange for...\" no article I have seen has really covered what was received in exchange for the injection. As far as I can tell, it was just friends helping friends. Which for me is a giant sign saying, \"Collusion found here! Come back on Thursday for the Melvin special\" \n\n\nMy second premise for collusion is the message consistency in the media. Nearly every media outlet gets their pocket lined by one hedgefund or another. Jim Cramer admitted as much in his video explaining how hedgefunds manipulate media to influence stock prices. I don't believe that each institution practices manipulation on an individual basis. You would see a lot more conflicting messages if they did. The consistency of the message from the media on GME is astounding. They all have slightly different reasons and theories, but all of them have the exact same conclusion, the shorts covered. **BULL FUCKING SHIT**. \n\n\nMy third and final premise for collusion, is more speculative. I believe that the second wave of GME is another institution winding down their short position. If they can loan each other money to keep their friends liquid, then they can certainly all get together and find a cost effective way to exit their shorts. I believe this is what's happening right now. I think they fucked up so bad, that they have to collude in order to unwind this position or they lose all of their money. \n\n\nIn conclusion\n\n\nThey are colluding on their exits so they don't pay out 10k a share, so they don't have to sell all of their other positions to cover, so the insider whale douchebags can pull out their money and replace it with dumb money to pay us a pittance with, so they can all survive when they fucked up so badly, so they don't get a slap on the hands from uncle Sam, and finally so they can once again fuck the retail investor.\n\n\nWhat do I know, I am an autist who is playing calvinball.

This time, I bought like 2 shares and rode them from $160 to $326. I wouldnt have really cared had these shares gone to shit.\n\nDespite what many people who have a vested interest in this succeeding are telling you, a price increase to 800$ is not **certain.** A lot of shorts have already been and are being covered right now. The volume yesterday and today combined is the same as the total float. This is huge. The volume on Wednesday was 71mil., which is bigger than the actual float. While I am sure that the short interest right now is still very high, because this seems like free money to most hedgefunds a further price increase is not certain at all at these levels. Im confident that 90% of shares shorted at 40-90$ have already been squeezed out, causing the massive price increases to $340. The only way another short squeeze happens is if some insitution decides to make it happen by playing the long side and squeezing out the shares reshorted at 200-300$, but this would be very hard, since the price is already so high. Not impossible but NOT CERTAIN. Despite all the hivemind shit you hear on this sub. YOU NEED TO CONTROL YOUR RISK and if you're betting a large part of your life on this succeeding you should sell gme until movement in the stock doesnt dictate your financial security. Retailers are not driving the price anyway, so dont lose your life savings and go into debt because you saw a \"apes together strong\" meme or some dumb shit.  \n\n\nThe most ironic shit is that if you follow wsb advice you can never win because even if a squeeze happens, the posts here will tell you that \"its not the real squeeze, hold dont sell\", so you can never actually profit from it by selling to the shorts that need to cover. Selling to them is left up to some smart retailers and mainly the institutions that are playing the long game on this. Don't help them, HELP YOURSELF. CONTROL YOUR RISK. HAVE FUN BUT MAKE SURE YOU KNOW THAT THIS IS DUMB AS FUCK.\n\nTLDR: Another squeeze might happen but not certain. Make sure you know that, even if you wouldnt get this impression by browsing this sub.

I even read one apes theory that we should all purhase call options and that all those apes holding 4 shares of GME don't belong on the \ud83d\ude80 with us. This is based on the assumption that MM's who are writing\/selling these options are always hedging by buying the underlying asset, thus creating a huge leverage effect. I believe in some instances this may not be the case. When you look at the sheer number of $800 calls that were purchased and expiring today it far exceeds other more reasonable call levels. Say a MM decided the probability of GME hitting $800 today was exceedingly low, especially since they understand they could actually drive it there through the gamma effect mentioned previously, this MM may decide to just sell all hedging GME shares and sell those options \"naked\" This would have netted them profits from a sideways day of trading  and expiration of calls not in the money.\nThis is why we need to purchase calls at all levels and the underlying asset as well. Each in the money call option does force MM's to hedge. And every diamond handed ape out there is driving the price up too even if they only hold 4 shares.One ape weak, many apes strong!!

Ok guys I get it and I have been there when it comes to making this money with GME. I have been the guy who hits the refresh button all day, who GUH's the dips, of course I have in the past had to use credit because I had spent more of my paycheck  than I should have.  I have seen a lot of people who are getting  obsessive to the point its could be unhealthy. We are one of the most chilled out group of autists  I have ever met. Which is why I made this guide to remind you all of a few things. I based this guide off of posts I have seen and replies to posts I have made. Please note I am not speaking about 1 stock in general, this applies to everything market related. I just use GME because its an easy example. \n\n1. It's a good thing the market closes on the Weekend. This cannot be the only thing you focus on. As your parents or wife's boyfriend would tell you \" Go outside\". You need to get out and do other things not related to the stock market. Keep your hobbies, play with your kids, go see your parents. You have to get out and do things other than WSB,and watching tickers all day.\n2. Eat you Autistic pieces of shit. 3 Meals a day I dont care if its all Wendys, you have to eat 3 meals a day. On a serious note either eat some fruit or take a good multi vitamin. For the sake of not spending all of Melvins money on doctors visits please drink some water too.  \n\n3. DON'T SPEND MONEY YOU DON'T HAVE. If I see one more question about how margin works ,how to get approved for margin or if they should yolo all their money on Margin im going to have a stroke.  If you thought losing more than half your initial investment sucks, Imagine losing all you invested because you now owe your broker their portion. Then of course you might owe some interest on that pending on the broker.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4. Dont let this get in the way of your day job. I cleared near half my yearly salary on GME round one. I did this all the while working and not neglecting my responsibilities. I dont care if you're a  bagger at the grocery store or the stim man Crazy Joe. Do your shit so you can pay your bills. If you really cannot help it take some PTO on a day that you think you will need to watch it constantly. Just dont get fired.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n5. Your family probably thinks its cool you're in on something big ( GME for example),but they probably get sick of hearing about it. This should not be the only dialog you have with others around you. Keep that shit here, lets circle jerk. Told the wife today Im back in GME for 3k more ( I have been trying to swing trade it for RD 2 just to do something different all the while catching the squeeze). All she said was \" again?\". Now in RD 1 she was asking about it probably as much as I was looking at it . This is not nearly as cool as many of us think it is. Most people dont get whats happening or do not care. This is ok.\n\n6. Know when to get out. I know this is hard for people from my generation but in this game there are winners and losers. Dont be a fuckin loser you fucking loser. When this shit can change your life take some profit. Stay in diamond hand the shit out of it but take care of you. Someone during this squeeze will still buy at the top Guaranteed . He\/she will HODL and be stuck at sub 10% loss for sure.  Get in before its too late or just say this is not for me this time. \n\n7. Now this is kinda misinformation because the market makes no sense right now but.... Once something reaches the news,social media ,or is being talked about. Its usually too late. BUY the rumor sell the news.Someone out there already knew this before the media did, they got in when it was low. Once its common knowledge these people or firms are already selling leaving you bag holding. \n\n8. Do your DD. No!! not the DD your wife's boyfriend is giving her while you cuck looking at AH tickers on your phone. Research the stock , and decide for yourself. Go to investopedia and educate yourself on the vocabulary. You should know some basics behind stock fundamentals. If Im pushing a stock on here , you do not know me. I could just be trying to give you my bags to hold. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n9. Exercise please , you need to move about during your day. It will help you mentally and physically .\n\n10.Dont hate on others who dont invest in your stock. We are a support group, a fundamental group and above all else we eat crayons together. I bought GME in January at 40$ per share, got told I was a retard for doing so by my friends. Never said shit to them when it mooned,even though they told me WMT is where the money is. Not everyone is in GME, and those who are genuinely believe the hype. As my wife's boyfriend says to be when I get to be a grumpy gills \" If you dont have anything nice to say dont say anything at all.\"\n\n11.

WE HAVE STRONG POWER BEHIND.  this is my take. the drop two days ago was actually done by the longs instead of shorties. They did it on purpose to trigger short restriction just for today. If you look at the put volume for today, $250 for sure has one of the highest volume. That's why after the drop it went right back to $250 and has remained stable yesterday. TODAY WILL BE FUN. AND THE LONGS BEHIND US ARE SMART AND POWERFUL. I do think the fundamental has changed for GME. Thats why the longs have to clear the shorts for the future of GME. IF you compare market cap, revenue, cash, debt etc between GME and chewy. I DONT think market cap of GME should be any lower than chewy.\n\n\\>$200 of GME seems high compared to last year.

I've finally figured out how this shit's gonna go. And you better believe I'm poising myself to acquire this company in the process.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Here's how this is about to shake out with GameStop in the coming weeks\/months:\n\n- **The stock ain't going smoothly over $350.** When and if it does... Get ready for the planet to get knocked off its axis. $350 is apparently a magic number Melvin and the shorters are *terrified* of. Not sure why, but each time we get too close, their strategies go from what can only be described as \"Absolute Unfair Horseshit\" to \"Fuck It, Burn Everything to the Ground\" in a split second. They probably think everything they've been doing in between Feb 2nd and yesterday was \"playing nice.\" Well, if Melvin wants to play that way, fine. I'll be positioning myself to make out like a BANDIT if this thing never breaks $350 again. Say goodbye to what little liquidity remains. It's all gonna be mine. I'll even take all of those shares they seems to be pulling out of thin air to borrow. It's yoinkin' time.\n\n- **She ain't Fallin under $200 again pre-squeeze.** Somewhere in the range of $200-250 seems to be the new floor. This might be because of you diamond hand apes do not budge when your portfolio goes down 50-90%, or maybe it's because a shit ton of whales we don't even know about are sitting on massive limit buys, should it drop again. Either way, I think it's pretty clear that we are hanging out up here for a while. Which is... Fine. It's a bit expensive for me to throw more real life money at it haphazardly, but since I'm gonna be making my consistent moves in the range of $200-350, you better believe I got price traps in place all the way down from $200 to $50. And if it ever drops to or below $50 again, I'm just gonna get reckless buying with real life money. Doubt this will happen though, as it seems a lot of folks with more money to risk (and shorter term plans) are gonna catch the hell out of any dips. My business is picking up, and my accountant verified what I am doing in the market is basically a totally legal cheat code. So game on.\n\n- **GME shareholders will look more and more like a cult (again).** This should come as no surprise. Last round they took weeks to slide the stock value from $200 to under $40 (bad move, baby) and apes held together strong. All the paper hands pissed off and joined thetagang or gamestopmeltdown and those who remained vigilant have been rewarded. No matter what happens now, even if it goes to $1\/share, most of y'all are gonna take those to your grave. Only way out is up, and the further they press it down the more devout the apes become (only this time, I'm here. Drinking Melvin's milkshake with my verrrry long straw).\n\n- **The squeeze will happen, or I will own GameStop.** Either one will happen, or both will happen. But it is mathematically impossible for neither to happen. This strategy formed after weeks and weeks of watching GME drop after Feb 2, staring at every play retail investors could make, and realizing the **only** people capable of making money on that particular price action were short sellers (IV was high, but the stock didn't move quite fast enough for puts to print, selling calls to outpace the loss of value holding shares, or even CSPs to result in a profitable outcome)... The way I'm playing options and shares to amass all shares in the market is literally *accelerated* by the very short-seller-profiting bullshit that went down Feb 2nd to Feb 22nd.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Mark my words.** The only way I fail is if GME rockets past $350 between now and April, and stays there.\n\ntl;dr - Looks like it's just \ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd1a\ud83e\udd8ds, Short Sellers, and Hedge Funds \/ Whales now. Get ready for \"stagnation\" in GME price (high volatility sideways trading). Anything but up will help me accomplish my goal.\n\nY'all win or I win.

They are traded on the NYSE already and have a solid stock buy back and good dividends.  If legalization gets to the point were it can be sold in gas stations, think of the return.  MO has a bigger market cap than any other company but ORTEX gives them a lower PE and EPS ( $MO EPS 2.40 P\/E 10.21; $CURLF ($CURA on CSE) P\/E 210.98 EPS 25.97) and my guess is because of debt and the lawsuits they will be paying out until time ends.  Analyst return recommendations on Ortex also have a higher 12 month return potential for CURLF\/CURA (%25 vs. %2.9).  With that being said, MO is not selling weed to scale but when they do the growth can be explosive.  My one year play is still $CURLF but I will be hedging with $MO.

Since Cohen has joined the board other Chewy folks have been hired into senior roles. Cohen is in charge of a committee that is hiring the next CFO and is responsible for capital allocation. Sherman is not on that committee. Sherman tanked the last earnings call and stock price while cohen rescued it by buying a meme level of shares. \n\nCohen has made Sherman so much money (sherman has 2m shares that he can't sell easily as an insider).

The short sellers did cover most of their positions (140% SI is now 50% maybe, the author claims 30%). I'm pretty sure people claiming otherwise (like 200%-900%) are misinterpreting data (thinking short volume == short interest or something) or just straight up lying because they know it'll get upvotes.\n\n(Edit: Even if SI is in fact high, this doesn't contradict the theory)\n\n# So GME is fucked if SI is low?\n\n**Not at all.** There seems to be (according to the expert above) a particularly surprising and novel strategy emerging. He's calling it a \"gamma swarm\" and it works like this:\n\n# Call sellers are going short, but not for long\n\nWhen you sell a call you're betting that the option won't be exercised. That's it. If the price goes down, it's not going to be exercised and you pocket the money from the sale.\n\nBut what if it goes up? Then you have to cough up some shares and sell them for the strike price listed on the call option contract. With American calls this can happen at any time. With European calls this can only happen at the expiration date. That's the gamble when you sell call options.\n\nBig players don't play this gambling game.  **They only try to make a small amount of relatively risk-free money, but they do it millions of times.** That means they sell the call option and if the price starts to go up they buy the underlying shares. This way they can still pocket the premium they charged selling the initial contract. Why not buy the shares immediately? They sell \ud83d\ude80 calls to \ud83e\udd8d (like $800c) and if they bought every time they sold some of those, there'd be pretty much no shares left. So they wait for a bit and see where the price goes.\n\n# How long do they wait?\n\nFor GME? 1-5 minutes. That's wild.\n\n# How does this impact GME?\n\nAt the time of writing this, the [call sellers are selling](https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/quote\/GME\/options?p=GME) a single $300c contract for $21.10. That contract must be purchased in a bundle of 100, so the buyer pays $2,110.\n\nNow, if the seller decides to hedge (**which is more likely if the call option is near the money**), they'll go and purchase 100 shares. Assuming the price is near the strike price, that's $30,000 worth of shares. So the buyer just motivated an institutional purchase of over 10x what they paid.\n\n# So, ultimately, what's happening?\n\nThe author has a lot of interesting claims so I highlighted a couple out of order:\n\n\"This leverage has changed the game. It will be \u201cinteresting\u201d to watch as traders probe the market with this new instrument, to find out what it can really do.

It didn't regain it's almost 400 glory, but ending in the green for the day is certainly a success, imo.  \n\nSo what(if anything) can we do to prevent this sort of thing again?\n\nI'm gonna try to tag this serious, so as to avoid 100's of diamond hand emoji's and ape memes.","932":"What the GME Gamma Squeeze needs to keep going, and why it will probably run out of fuel. These are my thoughts on a very solid article on the GME gamma squeeze which fits the available data well and shows a reasonable case for both correlation and causation between OTM call option buying and the stock price movements. It can be found here and has been doing the rounds on WSB:\n\n[https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/georgecalhoun\/2021\/03\/10\/gamestop-the-second-surgeanatomy-of-a-gamma-swarm\/?sh=7314f9ff4225](https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/georgecalhoun\/2021\/03\/10\/gamestop-the-second-surgeanatomy-of-a-gamma-swarm\/?sh=7314f9ff4225)\n\nTo be fair, only apes, bagholders or the very inexperienced actually believed the reason was a short squeeze. You can't tell them that though no matter what evidence is given to the contrary. The gamma squeeze theory seems a very credible explanation for the volatility.\n\nHere are a couple of other thoughts I had while reading the article that support a very bearish case:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. **A gamma squeeze needs at      least two criteria for the the stock to keep rising:**\n\n**a)** People buying OTM calls in very large volumes\n\n**b)** The stock rises to a unexpectedly rapidly to a point where those calls sold by market makers are in the money and they need to buy stock (or calls themselves, of different delta's and expiry's ) to re-hedge.\n\nThere are at serious problems for the bulls if these conditions don't occur and we may well see a share price implosion as the gamma squeeze ends - remember this is the only thing keeping up the price at this moment - as it's clearly not fundamentals (it's a 15-25$ stock) or a short squeeze.\n\n**Here the issues with condition a)**\n\nLooking at the ATM weekly call 250$, expiring March 19, we see from yesterdays price that it is $7500 (75$) giving a breakeven price at expiry ( not paying any attention to the other greeks. which given the theta decay and possible IV movements will hurt the buyer) of $325.\n\nThe 350$ strike with the same expiry trades at around 47$ (4700$)giving a break even price of 397$.\n\nNow, the problem with this is simple: These very risky call options are simply far to pricey for the average ape to afford, even those well OTM. **Usually the retards might be able to afford a short term (weekly) OTM lottery ticket type option that you see yolo'ed here on WSB all the time, but in this case due to the rise in share price and insanely high premium (implied volatility) , the vast majority of apes are well priced out - a $7500 or even riskier $4700 option that expires in a week is way beyond the budget of these guys.**\n\nIn addition, IV has been rising on the increased volatility the last couple of days AND earnings is just two weeks away. IV typically rises strongly on options coming into earnings, so these calls will become even more expensive (even if no share price drop occurs). Ironically the gamma spike will become a victim of it's own success.\n\n**Here are the issues with condition b)**\n\nOf course, the share price is pretty volatile day to day so I'm not going to try to predict it, but I would note a couple of important points:\n\n\\- The share price has risen due to the gamma squeeze (see article) and once people realize this many who don't understand it or thought the reason was due to a short squeeze may become very fearful as a gamma squeeze is a very short term phenomenon. The holders will see the share price as completely outside their control and holding or 'buying the dip\" (retailers volume is estimated to be around 1\/10th of institutions\/MM's\/quant funds\/ hedgies, most days at least) makes no difference - this isn't a short squeeze after all. Additionally they will see that as the share price is totally dependent on what the hedge funds want to do with it and can be manipulated at will ( see yesterdays 40% drop in 20 minutes) to suit their needs, and we don't know what hedge funds are long put options or long the stock (short term algos) and so on. Maybe they want it up temporarily if they are running momentum based algos or calls, but if they hold puts they will want it down. We simply don't know for sure, other than to note the current open interest put\/call ratio is around 3:1 - or the market has about 3x as many open puts as it does calls.\n\nMore importantly for the share price to 'gamma squeeze' you NEED condition a) to be fulfilled. It is the engine of the rocket and for fuel needs retards to buy OTM calls on mass. This is not happening anymore.\n\n\\- Secondly, the gamma squeeze is caused by market makers (who essentially want to be approximately delta neutral) re-hedging their position. Again this poses massive risks for bulls, as you need to consider what will happen if the share price begins to drop. As the price drops those OTM and ATM calls they sold to autists and the general trader will begin to decline in value. Now if the price drops enough ( as an example if you bought just before the halt that ATM weekly (250 strike) call was worth around 141$ and it dropped to 73$, a massive loss) the market makers will begin to re-hedge their risk in any of these ways:\n\n\\- Buy the call back for a significant discount ( or leave it for a few days to get it even cheaper due to theta decay). This means they can sell all 100 shares they may of been holding before as a hedge to price rises.\n\n\\- Buy the now other (now) much cheaper calls\\* to hedge their original sold call and sell some of the shares used to hedge\n\nNow, I've kind of skipped over the details here, but this is the essence of what should\/could happen. Now of course, those calls\\* themselves that are used to re-hedge will also have to be re-hedged by other market makers, but usually it's much cheaper to re-hedge a suddenly OTM call that you sold for maybe 50 delta that has dropped to 20 delta - it requires less purchase of the underlying. **So basically the net effect of a price drop will cause kind of a chain reaction - as the price drops, the market makers rehedge their sold calls and sell shares, and this in turn drops the price and the pattern continues.** It has similarities ( but is NOT the same -I'm not saying that at all) to a gamma squeeze, except now it's reversed, and the price drops caused by such a chain reaction probably wouldn't be as violent. This is because the potential upside on calls is unlimited (stock price can moon indefinitely - in theory) and thus are riskier for market makers, but if they sell a put the most they can lose is capped when the stock hits 0.\n\n**TLDR:**\n\nBulls are likely fuk if the gamma squeeze can't be sustained. This is due to market makers re-hedging ATM\/OTM sold calls and no longer needing to hold underlying shares as a hedge in the same quantities thus selling the shares and further driving down the price.\n\nWhatever happens bulls are fuk as this was a gamma squeeze from 40ish$ up to crazy numbers and gamma squeezes correct very quickly (hours\/days) especially once people realize what is going on.\n\n**Positions:**\n\nTons of different puts spreads at different strikes at expiry's 23-43 days out.\n\n**Edit**: A helpful person mentioned that I should have explicitly stated that you need **both extremely bullish ITM and OTM** call option activity to create a gamma squeeze. I totally agree and should have mentioned that.","933":"Interesting put volume spikes pre-dip and at the bottom I'm a newb and a retard, and certainly not a financial advisor of any kind. These are my thoughts based on the price action yesterday.\n\nSomeone made a shit ton of money from the drop.\n\nSo as most of you know a good deal of the price action over the last few days has been caused by high volume ATM call option buying rolling forward as the price climbs, and subsequent MM delta hedging.\n\nSomeone set a trap, buying a shit ton of puts OTM for cheap in a relatively low period of IV%, allowed the price to run up, then shorted the fuck out of the stock. They then sold their puts off at the bottom.

It's really interesting and helped me understand the underlying mechanisms driving this GME growth, and why it will continue: www.forbes.com\/sites\/georgecalhoun\/2021\/03\/10\/gamestop-the-second-surgeanatomy-of-a-gamma-swarm\/\n\nHowever, it also gave me an idea of what happened today and I want some feedback on the theoretical, and thoughts on why they wouldn't just keep doing this.\n\nThe article describes the price rise driven by the need for MM to cover calls. If they sell 100k calls on a volatile and rising stock, that are very likely going to actually buy those shares so the calls are covered. After two weeks of heavy call volume, they have maybe 1mil shares purchased at various prices that they will lose money on if the price keeps rising and they print. Let's say they're average price is $275 but the average call strike is $250.\n\nI don't understand options enough to know if this scenario is reasonable out how much money they would stand to lose, so apologies if I'm drifting off base.\n\nSo if I'm sitting on a million shares looking down the barrel of massive losses and I know I can't stop the increasing price, why not flood the market with those million shares I have so the price plummets, and then buy them back at much lower prices to bring my average down and possibly actually make money delivering ITM calls? It would almost be like buying the shares two weeks before selling the calls... Charging current rates on shares you bought at a discount.\n\nSo in this scenario, they may have dumped shares for an average price of $300, banking that $25 premium, but since they NEED those shares for delivery, and aren't willing to take the risk that their stunt will keep the price depressed, they buy them back at an average of $225, $25 less than the average call strike.\n\nThey net $50 per share without taking the risk of selling uncovered calls. If they're smart they used that additional $50 profit to buy additional shares at the depressed price so they can sell additional covered calls with a lower cost basis.\n\nSo... Can someone tell me why this wouldn't work? Or why it's probably not what happened. Because I'm sitting here, after the fact, thinking to myself, \"if I was an evil fuck, with loads of money to push shit around, and I don't want to lose  any of it, what would I do?\" And this is exactly what I would do.\n\nAnd if this is a reasonable hypothesis about what happened, what's to stop them from doing it every week? I know it doesn't hurt us financially (just psychologically) if we hold through it, but it will eventually scare more and more people away. What's the recourse? Anyone care to weigh in?","937":"Why the price of GME shares could reach anywhere from $12k to $28k While reading through comments on WSB this week, I've seen a fair amount of skepticism regarding some popular price targets for GME. This post is an attempt to bring some context to some of these price targets. \n\nConsider the fact that, even if GameStop's market capitalization briefly reaches $2T, it still will not be the most valuable company in the world (that title will remain with Apple). **At a market cap of $2T, shares of GME will be worth $28,680.** At a share price of $10k, GameStop's market capitalization will be  \\~$700B, less than those of companies such as Alibaba, Tencent, Facebook, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple.\n\nNow, from the perspective of fundamentals, it doesn't make sense to compare GameStop's market cap to those of the companies just mentioned. However, in the context of a short squeeze, it seems like a reasonable comparison, especially in light of any evidence supporting the possibility that GameStop will briefly become the most valuable company in the world. And that possibility is quite plausible. \n\nRemember that Volkswagen became the most valuable company in the world when the price of its shares spiked in the midst of a short squeeze in 2008. You might say, \"Well, maybe market caps were more uniformly distributed in 2008, so the bar for VW was lower.\" Ok, fair point. But at the peak of the VW short squeeze, VW attained a market cap of \\~$420B. According to The World Bank (see [https:\/\/data.worldbank.org\/indicator\/CM.MKT.LCAP.CD](https:\/\/data.worldbank.org\/indicator\/CM.MKT.LCAP.CD)), the total market cap of all listed domestic companies worldwide was $32.27T in 2008, and $68.65T in 2018. So at the peak of the VW short squeeze, VW accounted for roughly 0.42\/32.27 = 1.3% of total market cap. In 2018, 1.3% of total market cap was $0.013\\*68.65T = $893B. **At a market cap of $893B, GME shares will be worth $12,806.** And this is a conservative estimate, since the current total market cap is considerably larger than it was in 2018.\n\nTL;DR: The price of GME shares could reach anywhere from $12k to $28k.

Today was obviously quite eventful, and it looks like we're gearing up for a very active Thursday and Friday. There have been a few differing theories & perspectives I've seen posted here on why the price of GME, AMC, and etc. plummeted and then recovered (though not fully) and I was thinking it'd be a good idea to collect some of the different theories in one place so we can assess their validity for ourselves. Here are the theories I've heard so far - will edit this post to add more if anyone in the comments suggests additional theories and can provide a rationale that *could* make sense. Also TLDR at bottom.\n\n- The Short Hedgefunds Theory: The HFs that are shorting GME decided to flood the market with low-priced shares to drop the price down and get people to panic sell.\n- [The Short HFs and Media Theory:](https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/m2dil9\/the_gme_dip_today_was_shock_a_coordinated_effort\/) Beyond just the action from the shorting HFs, some people have also suggested that the media is in cahoots with these shorting HFs because of how quickly they posted about the price dropping. There have been a few pieces of evidence for this claim, but no real \"smoking gun\". Some of the evidence has been:\n 1. Articles were coming out about the drop roughly 20 minutes after the drop started. Some people are suggesting this is too short of a timeframe to write and publish an article. I personally think this is inaccurate given how quickly I've seen the media publish articles about stock movements in the past, but that's just my opinion.\n 2. Google indexed a news article about the drop 14 hours before it was posted. [Another user posted reasoning of why they think this isn't sufficient proof.](https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/m2dil9\/the_gme_dip_today_was_shock_a_coordinated_effort\/gqin9qf\/)\n 3. There have been screenshots of an article that was posted about an hour before the drop happened, talking about the drop. I haven't been able to find the article with this timestamp so am skeptical of this + think it may be photoshopped, but I'm unsure who would lie about this and what their motivation would be.\n- The Bullish Hedgefunds Theory: A bit similar to the shorting HFs theory, however, this theory suggests that the price drop was actually caused by HFs who are bullish on GME, AMC, etc - the same ones who some have theorized caused our current run-up in the first place. The evidence for this is that a massive amount of OTM call options were purchased when the drop occurred. I personally think this is the most likely scenario, as I don't see how that many options could be bought on the downswing by retail alone. That said, it could be that people were checking out the options prices while trading was halted and then made their purchases as soon as trading unfroze.\n\nThis is what I've seen so far - let me know if there's anything further I should add!\n\nTLDR: HODL","939":"GEEE MMMMMM EEEEEEE Hey apes,\n\n**I know today for some of us was still a +7% day, and for others, it was an \"uh oh I am freaking out\" kinda day.** So I have been looking in the Mega-Thread and I stumbled upon a comment about a GME analysis! **I watched a few of this guy's videos and I have to say I am impressed.

Here are my tendies, may you soon receive yours as well\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/305b6diq2bm61.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a0dcf8aefcaacf9928cdeb9c417d79941a9ee4cf","941":"What we experienced today with GME & AMC is confirmation: WE HAVEN'T EVEN LICKED THE FUSE TO START THE MOASS GOOD EVENING to all of my favorite little Crayon eating, piss martini drinking, diamond handed big NUTTED ape buddies,\n\nNow I know that all of you little shit throwing apes that haven't been on this ride before were dropping fat donkey kongs in your Huggies this afternoon during the brief GME\/AMC nosebleed. If you survived the slaughter, congratu-fucking-lations. If you bought the dip, you know the way, and are truly, one big fat diamond loving retard. If you paper handed or had stop-losses set, you're a bitch and the rest of us diamond hands thank you for exiting our rocket before we make our first landing on planet **$69,420.69**. The Tendieman is coming way faster than you think.\n\n**The Hedgefunds**\n\nToday, these stupid little shit fuckers really decided to show us their entire hand. They used the same short attack that they used previously, but not only did they do it so blatantly obvious, they did it across our beloved GME and AMC (THESE ARE THE ONLY PLAYS THAT MATTER, THEY DID IT ELSEWHERE TOO). This was the most obvious share-shake attempt that I've ever seen, and it was done more outwardly than the previous attempt. **THEY'RE SCARED, WE HAVE TO BE CLOSE TO INITIATING PHASE 1 OF THE MOASS.** As GME and AMC keep rising, they have to keep buying more and more shares to lose less money on the options that are ITM or will be ITM by the end of the week. They extra fucked themselves today with their bullshit attack. **They triggered the short sale restriction** meaning that tomorrow (for GME), they won't be able to orchestrate such a massive attack because they'll only be able to short shares during upticks; *but ape say \"if big back fat crying down his back Melvin just short on uptick won't it crash?\"* **NO, BECAUSE GME UPTICKS EVERY .6969696996420 MILLISECONDS.** ***Tomorrow we will be able to BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY*** and these chicken shits won't be able to shake the shares out of the paper handed bitches as easily as they had today. I'd include pretty little pictures with colors for all of you crayon eating shits, but I know they mean nothing to any of us, **HODL.**\n\n**The Media**\n\nThe media is so fucking crooked and tied in with these hedgies that they literally only speak when GME and AMC downticks 10-20%. All day long they were silent until the short attack, then all of the sudden our \"MEME STOCKS\" were worthy of mentioning. I think this is clear indication that they're being paid and gagged by these chode dicked chicken shit hedgies. In conclusion, don't listen to the media, don't listen to the articles, the analysts, or even your mother. **TRUST THE RETARD INSIDE YOUR HEAD.**\n\n**The Crayon Eaters**\n\nForemost, I love you ape brothers. Many of you have been here from the start, and some of you may have even just joined today, but it doesn't matter so long as you HODL. **Together ape strong.** Remember that you are holding diamonds, everyday that you hold these diamonds you're costing Wallstreet and the egotistical bastards that stole from your families in 2008 billions and billions of dollars, but its nothing in comparison to what we will achieve when we take back *TENS of billions* of dollars from them. Getting rich is cool, but sticking it to the man and getting back what is rightfully ours is even sweeter. I've gained a sense of true happiness from these gorgeous little stonks, and I've already decided that IF these stocks go to zer-**HAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHHAHA FUCK THAT THESE BITCHES AINT GOIN' NOWHERE THEY'RE GOING TO THE GO FUCKING PARABOLIC AND WE'RE ALL GOING TO GET FILTHY RICH; THE RED PRICE NEXT TO YOUR SHARES IS THE DISCOUNT TO BUY MORE. HANG IN THERE, NO RETARDS LEFT BEHIND. WE ARE COMING BACK FOR YOU ALL ON THE WAY TO $69,420,696,696,696,420.696.**\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nFuck the hedgefunds, their bitchass tricks didn't work today, it made things worse, and made us apes stronger. The media is as F.O.S as they've ever been and are doing anything they can to help their hedgefund sugar daddies out. **Apes together strong, HODL till $69,420,696,696,696,420.696.**\n\n***Obligatory legal pardon:*** **Don't listen to me I never passed 3rd grade, I am not a cat, but I am a thoroughly convinced diamond handed ape who loves the stonk.

Keep strong my fellow apes, and Let's go to the moon! THIS WEEK WE WILL REACH THE MOON!**\n\nI've been holding positions in both stocks (AMC and GME) for more than one month, and I know more than one have already noticed this trend, but I wanted to post it here, so the people that haven't noticed can see it.\n\nAt the top you can see GME's charts, at the bottom AMC's charts, left side is ONE DAY chart, and right one is a ONE MOTNH chart. As you can see every time GME spikes or goes down, AMC follows, you can say, it is the market that is moving all together, but that is not true, I have position in other 10 stocks, and I have checked other stocks and I know for sure this cannot be just coincidence.\n\n**NOTE:** *Don't take my word as a financial advice, because it is not, I am not a financial advisor, neither a CAT, I just love both stocks so much that every hour of everyday I am looking at these charts.*\n\nEdit: Typos, and fixed format.\n\n[GME vs AMC Chart](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/mtjj15eibam61.png?width=1984&format=png&auto=webp&s=35b8b026775ab1a55b93bcaccbb63a026805ba07)","944":"GME technical analysis from a retard Part 3. Why I think the short squeeze is nearly here. Last week I drew out a chart looking like this\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/acopf56dr9m61.png?width=1184&format=png&auto=webp&s=921fe515d9d1fe8b49c7fc0ff410a016c0b3d5d6\n\nLets see the results...\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/8odmmly13am61.png?width=1142&format=png&auto=webp&s=0860362e90fb97b8484df24335ec93dc79e259e4\n\nThe chart played out perfectly with the 3rd daily candle now sitting around the $260 area. The only difference is the chart has a **retarded doji** instead of a normal candlestick. This retarded doji now makes me think the squeeze potential is much higher & close to happening. Let me break it down. **The GME rocket is nearly fuelled up ready to go full retard mode.**\n\nWe have just completed a cup & handle gap fill from a gamma squeeze which is why the stock has pushed up this week, however the stock has the ability to push a lot further before the eventual short squeeze. This is due to **IV** (implied volatility). For instance, let's say GME increased from $260 to $269, that would be a 9 dollar difference with a 3.4% increase. Now let's say GME was $20 and increased by the same amount of dollars to $29. It would be the same dollar difference but with a 45% increase in share price this time. This is the exact reason why the gamma squeeze in January was unsustainable and died down quickly because it had a low IV. It went all the way from around $15 to $450 in a quick space of time which the stock itself couldn't handle. Now that GME has had a steady increase to $260 per share, it has a much higher IV & will be able to sustain a $450 price tag without crashing down as it would only be a 73% increase. It's crucial that GME sustains this gradual increase in share price so it can increase it's IV and have the ability to go to **$69420 per share** from a technical point of view.\n\n**Why the stock was heavily attacked today & what the stock needs to do to go to $69420 per share and why it WILL**\n\nWe established that GME had enough IV to go from $15 to $450 for a brief period of time, that's a 3000% increase. That means that if GME can slowly get to $2314 per share, this will be the launch pad for GME to increase by 3000% to go to $69420 per share. To go to $2314 from where it's at now at $265, that's only an 873% increase which is much less than the 3000% increase in January. A crucial point was when the stock recently ran up from $40 to consolidating at $120, this is CRUCIAL as the fact the stock didn't crash back down means that the 300% increase is sustainable for the IV. Using this calculation I can concur that in order for GME to get to $2314 per share & stay there, it needs to slowly run up to $772 per share so it can increase by 300% to get to $2314 and be a sustainable launch pad to $69420. This is why the hedge funds short attacked the stock today with all they could as they realised this and are scared shitless.\n\nIf a low IV causes a major move to the upside to crash back down, that means that a major move to the DOWNSIDE will cause the stock to go UP. This is why hedge funds are truly FUCKED because this was their only opportunity to try & trigger a sell off to cover at a low price and they could only get it down to $180. They still haven't covered yet. What they have done now is actually increase the IV of the stock with the retarded doji and now it may be EVEN easier to get to $69420. **If you see another sharp drop again due to a short attack it is nothing to fear, I am only talking about how GME needs a steady uprise, it doesn't matter if it has sharp dips, they only make it easier for the stock to rise quicker.**\n\n***I have to say it's very dirty what the hedge funds tried to do today... make the stock tank 40% then put out pre written articles about the tank to scare people into selling. That is not only chart manipulation but a malicious attack directly towards the company and it's shareholders who just like the stock & weren't ready for a 40% loss on their investment. It's not the shareholder's fault that hedge funds naked shorted a stock over 100%, that's a conscious decision they made themselves to do & turned out to be a bad one. It shouldn't be the reason why honest shareholder's saw an unprecedented 40% loss on their investment today.***\n\n**TL;DR** I like the stock & it's fundamentals, I think it's a great company. They generated over 6B revenue before the pandemic and are now transforming their business model into e-commerce. I believe they will become one of the world's leading gaming companies. I am very bullish on GME. I like the stock. It seems to have a lot of respect from the public who also like the stock & the company. I believe the entry point of $269 per share is a great long term hold, the short squeeze is just another attraction & interesting to see & analyse\n\nThis is not financial advice, I am just a retard who did some math and came up with random numbers","945":"Detailed Analysis to Explain What Happened Today. Just Look at Volume. **TLDR:  $GME Volume during 12:20pm - 12:41pm crash indicates this was either a large  whale sell order (unlikely) or algorithmic short selling (likely). Keep  HOLDING!**\n\nJust like you, I  was stunned, amazed, bewildered, and intrigued as the price of $GME  fell like a falling knife within minutes. As I watched the price  plummet, the relatively low volume that transpired during that cliff  dive didn't make sense to me.\n\nLet's dive in.\n\n[$GME Daily Chart and Volume](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/zq8ft5pm4am61.jpg?width=1320&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=57cbbd3d5c04822441a1ffa5c3d3028b473eab5f)\n\nLet's zoom into the drop that started around 12:20 PM.\n\n[Price and Volume Chart in Minute Increments](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/bdd39mde4am61.jpg?width=1320&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=35fef4c2488fe6c24abd3fdfdafe91a30d4d913b)\n\nAs  the price dropped, the peak minute volume was 936.7K. From 12:20 PM to  the bottom at 12:41 PM, the total volume traded was 4.32 million shares.  In the grand scheme of things, this is NOT A LOT of volume for such a  violent price move.\n\nThis points to two possibilities in my mind.\n\n**Possibility #1 (Unlikely)**\n\nThe  first possibility is that this was a large sell order by a whale  looking to cash out. This is less likely in my opinion. If an actual  whale was trying to sell out of its position, it would not sell all of  its shares at one time cratering the stock price and inducing halts.  They would trickle in sell orders throughout the day to get out of their  position and maximize profit. This was definitely NOT retail selling,  you could barely even put in a sell order fast enough when this was  dropping.\n\n**Possibility #2 (Likely)**\n\nThe  second possibility is that this was an algorithmic short attack to  induce fear and panic selling. This is more likely in my opinion. If you  look at the total volume during this time-frame along with the rate the  stock was falling, this screams of a deliberate short attack. The  volume throughout the week was not high enough to indicate shorts have  covered. Conversely, there are actually less shares available to short  at the end of the day. According to multiple websites, there are now  only 150,000 shares available to short.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn  conclusion, this was most likely an algorithmic short attack from  12:20pm to 12:41pm. GME's thesis has not changed. A gamma squeeze is  also a likely possibility tomorrow through Friday. I believe GME is  restricted to short on upticks only (SSR) till tomorrow so it should be  an exciting Thursday. Keep holding and remember...

Here is what I think happened today while you were busy shitting out the crayons you had for lunch. \n\nToday's GME dip was clearly a short attack. Most likely manipulation based on the sketchy timing of some articles, but my point is independent on that. I think as fucked up as it is to hear this, some hedge funds won on this one and that can even be good for us. Hear me out before you start screaming like the apes we are. \n\nFirst, there is absolutely no way retail had anything to do with this. We sure as hell  didn't cause such a strong dip by paper handling coincidentally all of us all of a sudden,  this was an orchestrated short attack. The interesting part was how it bounced back. And I believe that again there is no way retail had anything to do with it. How much money do we really have left to fight such an enormous dip at this point? We are balls deep in already. We apes keep saying to each other \"BUY THE DIP\" but let's face it, we ain't got no money left to buy the damn dip. We have put everything we have and beg our wife's boyfriend to give us some ramen noodles for dinner. \n\nSo here is what I think happened.\n\n1) Short attack by hedge funds which caused many stop losses to be activated. They then covered back that short attack, making gains from panicked day traders, stop losses, algos that started selling and paper handed bitches. \n\nOr\n\n2) The bounce back was again made by hedges, opposing ones this time. It's a war out of there and even though most hedge funds are owned and run by corrupt greedy douchebags, some of them are on our side, the long side of the trade. Or they have no skin in the direction of the game and simply like volatility. These are the ones that profited from today and fucked the shorts.\n\nSo what now my fellow gorillas? We view this as a good sign. Even if some hedge funds won, either the ones that shorted and profited like in case 1, or opposing hedge funds like case 2, what we want is high volatility. High volatility leads to more madness, more shorting and more chaos. This is what is gonna send us flying to the moon. We won't fly to Jupiter on a 5% day gain, we need the volatility. If you hate volatility go play boomer stocks.\n\n\nTLDR Hedge funds are most likely at war. High volatility is good for us. GME to the moon.","950":"How am I gonna get my stimmy money so I may double down the portfolio.

For now I just want that 2K.\n\nSincerely,\nStarvin Marvin","951":"Why I'm super happy to watch evil hedgies shave 1\/3 of GME and AMC Hello WSB, this is my first official post, but I'm very proud to see how we have all HODL together really strong.\n\nI have been in GME since 30 Oct 2019 with an additional 1670 shares on 29 May 2020 and I wish I could take a screenshot to prove my words, but my custodian account does not allow any screenshots out of \"security\" reasons. I currently hold over 6 digits of value in GME and I hope to reach my 7 digits and possibly 8. After what happened today, my 7 digits is certain, 8 digits possible. With more crayons maybe I'll reach 9.\n\nThat being said I like to share and encourage with everyone why this nosedive drop we seen today is actually the BEST affirmation we really need.\n\nThere's been wonderful DD that the Short interest are still extremely high and that the data in FINRA is entirely unreliable. Let's be honest, before what happened today, no matter how certain we are, we weren't 100% sure.\n\nI'm an expert in Chinese history, and I'll quote Sun Tzu, the famed author recognised for writing the Art of War over 2000 years ago.\n\n\u201cIf you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.\u201d\n\nTruth is we never really knew what the hedges were up to and this week was really fishy, with the absence of obvious short ladders and peaceful markets. Other than occasional dips everyday after reaching a peak, we couldn't tell much. Some people have speculated that maybe the hedges were buying calls in order to reduce their risks, but I think we can all agree now that there is a good possibility that the dips we've been seeing the last few days are just a test for hedges to see how much the price can be affected.\n\nAnd let's be honest with ourselves, that was a coordinated attack. I have no idea how long they have planned that, but looking from what we've seen, it's definitely a lot of time. At that scale it's not possible for 1 or 2 hedge funds to pull this off by themselves. And YET!! This is where we recovered strong.\n\nSo what this means is this. The hedges are panicking. They are worried. And they have proven that the shorts *HAVE NOT BEEN COVERED*. If they have been covered to the large extent they claimed to, today's coordinated attack wouldn't have happened.\n\nNot just did they admit with their actions that they are fearing us, they also basically highlighted to us what stocks they are all massively shorting. AMC, KOSS, NOK, BB all are in this together with us GME Army! \n\nYou know it's like Harry Potter, where Voldemort basically handed the weapons to Harry by his own hands.\n\nBased on Chinese History, there's this clever strategist Sun Tzu. For him before he executes any clever maneuvers for war, he will always test them first. If the hedges we are up against are the same smooth brain people like Sun Tzu, this fall is only a test. But it's costly to them and we have held strong. With the current prices, supposing they did buy some shares to cover their losses, all those buys from 180 to 250 are all gone. Now they are forced to buy shares above 260 and its only going to cost them even more. Much better for us.\n\nFellow apes, they are really afraid of our gamma squeeze this week and next week.\n\nNow... We strike back, by doing NOTHING!\n\nEdit:\n[to the skeptics who need proof for everything](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/aTaF8j6)\n\nI obviously have better things than to post everything on social media like a attention seeking person. I'm a retarded ape not a peacock. Your tongues will wag too no matter what even if my picture has shown my platform to be ancient. But that's nothing to do with my investing preferences. \n\nFor you skeptics who need proof for everything and choose to always doubt and flake, here it is. \"A confident man does not live for the applause and approval of the non-worthy\". Your skeptical outlook has only said to me that you clearly did not see Gamestop for what it really was earlier on, and even if DFV's DD was shown to you in those days, you were a late adopter. It has also shown me that you have the paper hands tendency when you don't see potential and when the going gets tough. \n\nI thought I have surpassed and ignored most silly comments, but thanks to the 1% of negative words, you have helped me see I still react to silly nonsense and it's something I need to change in myself. You are a Hyena and this is a community of apes. Reflect on yourselves.","952":"GME Going from around 480 on Jan25 down to 40 couple weeks ago mean, investors at the top lost over 95%. If it were to run up over 480 in the next few days or hours, no billions in cash can stop it like before since almost every MF that bought it will hold to show off their diamond haired balls and flash a few lambos on the way. \n\nMy analysis is that GME has to go up over 480 because\n1. It came down 95% \n2. The only way to moon is over 480.\n3. Every day close price is higher than the previous \n4. Maybe every one is tricking the suspend switch this time at Saving Elite Crowd by going it slow as an airplane rather than as a rocket. Comfy rides are a plus. \n5. The business goals and the team looks amazing and might have impactful earnings due to the release of PS5 and XBOX in Q4 and now the actual digital transformation news\n\nApes, Diamond Hands, Adamantium Balls, Retail Retards:\nYSK with a very slight unnecessary and useless hedgie-caused pullback, it can go to MARS well ahead of TESLA\n\nI made some on GME and lost it all on other shit. Now going to get back in. Wish me YOLO luck\n\nEDIT: I like the stock.","953":"Why can't the GME shorts just file bankruptcy soon and walk away? A rich cousin going through bankruptcy after her husband died unexpectedly once told me \"If you are going to file bankruptcy anyway, don't go around town paying off your debts because you will need all your money for lawyers\".  At some price point, the various shorts are going to realize things are looking really bad for them.  If they can't manipulate GME down to sub $50 range or whatever it takes to save themselves or ride this out hoping WSB apes will give up the attack, rather than wait for GME to hit $800 (pick a big number) what's stopping them from calling it quits when GME is $200 or $300 (now), filing bankruptcy, and save themselves a $ Billion (or more)?","954":"How is GME trending? A picture of all the media blackout. &#x200B;\n\n[Google trends - GME & Gamestop, worldwide, last 90 days.](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/idsugl3ap7m61.jpg?width=1442&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b254e811b6eb46f48cf84a4458855ba40c98644a)\n\nFellow apes, this is very simple but first let me say sorry for the picture with portuguese words but I assume most of you can read any language anyway. Well the picture above, not only points to the moon, but also shows - via google trends - that \"trendwise\" GME & Gamestop are at the same level as they were back in 2020. This pictures the reason behind the blackout that is going on around the media: it can be very very dangerous (read interesting for us) if this thing gets the smallest bit of media focus because it will just fuel the biggest rocket launch in the whole security history.  Stay safe & Godspeed.","955":"GME and the Chocolate Factory After reading Charlie and the Chocolate Factory to my children, then watching the 1971 movie, the GME events were predicted 40+ years ago.  I included pictures to help guide you along.  I hope this is helpful for you apes.\n\nHere is my analysis:\n\n* **Charlie Bucket** - Throughout the movie and the book, Charlie is represented as the typical retail investor \ud83e\udd8d.  \n* **Willy Wonka** - (sometimes represented as a bandana-wearing \"Not-a-Cat\" cunning analyst) informs the retail investors \ud83e\udd8d of his analysis of a particular stock that he likes.  And if you like the candy (stock) \ud83c\udf6c, buy it, as it may have a golden ticket. \ud83c\udfab\n* Large corporations \ud83c\udfe2 buy large amounts of candy (stock) \ud83c\udf6c because they believe Willy Wonka's candy factory (Gamestop) \ud83c\udff0  is going to fail. \n* After sometime passes, the large corporations' plan fails as retail investors start finding golden tickets \ud83c\udfab in the candy \ud83c\udf6c they purchase causing more retail investors to buy.\n* With candy supplies \ud83c\udf6c being so low, corporations need to buy candy at higher costs \ud83d\ude80.  Not liking this, the corporations \ud83c\udfe2 restrict limits on the amount of candy \ud83c\udf6c which can be purchased.\n* One day, with the coordination of the media, a corporate good shows up on television and states the final golden ticket \ud83c\udfab has been found.  This sends the price of candy \ud83c\udf6c crashing.\n* Charlie finds a dollar and buys a few bars of candy.  Inside the bar, he finds a golden ticket. \ud83c\udfab  The corporation has been lying about their position all long.  The price of candy \ud83c\udf6c increases. \ud83d\ude80  All this time, Charlie had \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50.\n\n***Willy Wonka's Factory Guests*** \ud83c\udff0 \n\n* **Augustus Gloop** - Augustus loves chocolate.\ud83c\udf6b  The moment, he saw the chocolate river (gains), he fell in the river, getting stuck in the pipe.  Augustus had paper hands.  Augustus should have held. \n* **Violet Beauregarde** - Violet chewed gum all the time.  When she saw the new chewing gum prototypes, her dad urged her to keep on chewing despite the others in the group to stop.  As Violet was turning into a big blueberry \ud83d\udd35, her dad cheered her on.  The Oompa-Loompas had to roll her out of the roll her out of the room and de-juice her.  Her dad was a corporate shill and did not care about her position.  He put his own interests before hers.  He would be encouraging stockholders to do things that would damage their positions to benefit his or his hedge funds.\n* **Veruca Salt** - When Veruca saw the squirrels \ud83d\udc3f opening the nuts \ud83c\udf30, she wanted one right away.  She insisited on obtaining a nut \ud83c\udf30 opening squirrel \ud83d\udc3f instead of practicing patience.  When she tried to steal a squirrel \ud83d\udc3f, they ganged up on her, throwing her in the nut \ud83c\udf30 chute.  Veruca needs to learn that you cannot rush a squeeze.  You need to practice patience.  Her dad was going to buy a squirrel \ud83d\udc3f.  That's what you do during a squeeze: buy and wait.\n* **Mike Teavee** - After going to the TV room \ud83d\udcfa, the group is told Wonka-vision is going to revolutionize the world.  Mike Teavee was going to have none of that and immediately gets on the the stage and transports himself to a smaller state.  Mike Teavee is the ultimate case of Buy High \ud83d\udcc8, Sell Low \ud83d\udcc9.  The others learned that Wonka's mission is going to help everyone who is fighting FOR the cause, not against it.\n\n***Other Characters***\n\n* ***Grandpa Joe*** - During the tour, Grandpa Joe passes a room with bottles of soda \ud83c\udf7e.  Grandpa convinces Charlie to drink the soda \ud83c\udf7e.  The soda \ud83c\udf7e causes Charlie and Grandpa Joe to fly and almost hit a ventilation fan.  Thankfully, Charlie finds a way to get out of the position and they are both safe.  Grandpa may be a corporate shill and tried to distract Charlie with worthless positions so he can take advantage of Charlie's position.  Do not get distracted.  Stay focused on your own goal.\n* ***Arthur Slugworth*** - Before entering the factory, Arthur Slugworth bribes Charlie to commit sabotage by sneaking out an Everlasting Gobstopper \ud83c\udf6d.  Later in the movie, Slugworth turns out to be someone employed by the Wonka factory to test if Charlie can be trusted.  Some posters can be trusted with their posts, others cannot.  It is up to you to investigate if their gain porn or loss porn is fabricated.  Is their Due Diligence accurate or not?  Is their YouTube stream paid for by hedges or are they grifting?\n\n***That Scary River Scene*** \ud83d\udc79\n\n* The scene on the river is similar to CNBC, the Senate Hearings, and other media outlets trying to scare retail investors to sell their shares.  As a kid, it was scary as hell, but we all turned out ok, right??\n\n***Conclusion***\n\n* In the end, Charlie held \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50 and won the Chocolate Factory.  The last scene of the movie was the elevator, crashing through the roof and going \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 to the moon \ud83c\udf1a\ud83c\udf1a\ud83c\udf1a.\n\n\n\n***TL:DR;***  Charlie \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50 crashed through the roof, \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 to the moon \ud83c\udf1a\ud83c\udf1a\ud83c\udf1a.  The others paper handed, tried to distract Charlie, and got roasted. \n\nThis is not financial advice.  This is not a movie review.  I am not a financial adviser.  I am not a movie critic.

(REPOSTED) REPOST because I accidently included a relevant YouTube link in an edit (about a DRYS short squeeze) and this caused the automoderator to delete it). Sorry!\n\nAlso, since I got feedback I didn't include enough Emojis, here's a rectification:\n\n# \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83c\udf19\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50\n\nFirst, let's look at the players involved here.\n\n# The shorts\n\nOn the short side, we have some hedge funds (most notably Melvin and Citadel) who aimed to make money by shorting gamestop, which they saw as a failing brick and mortar store chain.\n\n# The Market Makers (may have some overlap with the shorts)\n\nMarker makers write options (contracts to be allowed to buy (call) or sell (put) shares for a specific price at or before the expiry date). They collect a fee for selling those contracts, but they make the best profit if the contracts expiry worthless, because then they get to keep their fee, and don't need to keep their contract because it wasn't in the money. How does this work? Well, for example when GME was trading around $40, they sold contracts for $800 for the next month or so, never expecting the price of GME to even reach anywhere near $800, so the \"fools\" who bought the options to buy $800 calls for march 12th and march 19 will be left with worthless calls, or so they thought. (More on this later).\n\n# The longs\n\nOn the long side, we have you glorious apes  \ud83e\udd8d \ud83e\udd8d \ud83e\udd8d, Cohen, and competing hedge funds who are smelling blood and do not hesitate to pull the trigger on Melvin and other shorts, especially if they can make some money while doing so.\n\nNow let's look at the actions that have led up to this.\n\nIt all started when the shorts were getting greedy, and with Covid19 thought they could pull the plug on gamestop, which they saw as a failing brick and mortar game store that would go the way of blockbuster. They did not expect gamestop would survive covid, and they did everything in their power to make it so. Shorting the company to the ground, with the goal being to drive the price to $0 for maximum and tax-free profit. It's important to point out that they COULD have covered at $3\\~$4 but DID NOT. If they did not cover at $3 or $4, what makes you think they covered at $40\\~$400? Hint: they didn't. In fact, they even admitted during the congress hearing to not covering by saying that the last peak to $400+ was just a gamma squeeze. In other words they have not even begun to cover yet.\n\n[Then some people liked the stock](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/m1p4up\/a_refresher_on_what_the_is_going_on_with_gme\/)\n\n[Some people have calculated that the real short interest in somewhere between 250% and 967%](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/m19sa7\/true_short_interest_in_gee_em_ee_could_be\/). (something like 200 million to 500 million shares short). Some people may think this is insane, but if you do the math, you will see that no matter what FINRA says, it's impossible for short interest to be below 200%, and it's more likely to be around 500\\~600%. It's hard to find reliable data, but if you just look at the volume and price action, it's obvious that the shorts have only INCREASED since January 28th, not decreased. It is mathematically IMPOSSABLE for the shorts to have covered. It simply doesn't add up.\n\n# How the Gamma squeeze will trigger the short squeeze\n\nSome people doubt this could reach $10k or even $100k, just as people doubted it could reach $1000s. But here is why those numbers are not only likely, but MATHEMATICALLY INEVITABLE. (I'm not an expert to so take it FWIW, feel free to call me an idiot, but if I'm right, I'll expect apologies).\n\nFirst, let's look at the option interest (source: [https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/market-activity\/stocks\/gme\/option-chain](https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/market-activity\/stocks\/gme\/option-chain))\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Strike|Open interest March 12th|Open interest 19th|Shares (combined 12+19)|Shares (combined 12+19 cummulative)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|250|3231|2842|607,300|607,300|\n|255|563|0|56,300|663,300|\n|260|1047|542|158,900|822,500|\n|265|303|0|30,300|852,800|\n|270|788|748|153,600|1,006,400|\n|275|1386|0|138,600|1,145,000|\n|280|595|319|91,400|1,236,400|\n|285|303|0|30,300|1,266,700|\n|290|268|299|56,700|1,323,400|\n|295|323|0|32,300|1,355,700|\n|297.5|475|0|47,500|1,403,200|\n|300|7,011|5,389|1,240,000|2,643,200|\n|302.5|131|0|13,100|2,643,200|\n|305|276|0|27,600|2,683,900|\n|307.5|77|0|7,700|2,691,600|\n|310|660|307|96,700|2,788,300|\n|312.5|106|0|10,600|2,798,900|\n|315|683|0|68,300|2,867,200|\n|320|406|908|131,400|2,998,600|\n|325|313|0|31,300|3,029,900|\n|330|374|264|63,800|3,093,700|\n|332.5|130|0|13,000|3,106,700|\n|335|124|0|12,400|3,119,100|\n|337.5|48|0|4,800|3,123,900|\n|340|587|244|83,100|3,207,000|\n|345|622|0|62,200|3,269,200|\n|350|1876|2426|430,200|3,699,400|\n|355|122|0|12,200|3,711,600|\n|360|1151|344|149,500|3,861,100|\n|365|78|0|7,800|3,868,900|\n|370|103|351|45,400|3,914,300|\n|375|106|0|10,600|3,924,900|\n|380|290|396|68,600|3,993,500|\n|385|112|0|11,200|4,004,700|\n|390|354|508|86,200|4,090,900|\n|395|223|0|22,300|4,113,200|\n|400|3527|5156|868,300|4,981,500|\n|405|189|0|18,900|5,000,400|\n|410|173|258|43,100|5,043,500|\n|\ud83c\udf3f\u2697\ufe0f|605|1246|185,100|5,228,600|\n|430|211|130|34,100|5,262,700|\n|440|176|176|35,200|5,297,900|\n|450|558|604|116,200|5,414,100|\n|460|276|129|40,500|5,454,600|\n|470|215|210|42,500|5,497,100|\n|480|156|323|47,900|5,545,000|\n|490|166|314|48,000|5,593,000|\n|500|3,149|7,122|1,027,100|6,620,100|\n|510|259|496|75,500|6,695,600|\n|520|393|714|110,700|6,806,300|\n|530|252|168|42,000|6,848,300|\n|540|129|161|29,000|6,877,300|\n|550|490|1557|204,700|7,082,000|\n|560|198|218|41,600|7,123,600|\n|570|305|194|49,900|7,173,500|\n|580|94|615|70,900|7,244,400|\n|590|87|272|35,900|7,280,300|\n|600|1715|2065|378,000|7,658,300|\n|610|99|180|27,900|7,686,200|\n|620|117|153|27,000|7,713,200|\n|630|98|112|21,000|7,713,200|\n|640|326|250|57,600|7,791,800|\n|650|464|456|92,000|7,883,800|\n|660|320|147|46,700|7,930,500|\n|680|198|289|48,700|7,979,200|\n|700|1189|1264|245,300|8,224,500|\n|720|210|299|50,900|8,224,500|\n|740|307|239|54,600|8,330,000|\n|760|659|358|101,700|8,431,700|\n|780|1936|1060|299,600|8,731,300|\n|800|22,244|27,686|4,993,000|13,724,000|\n\nNow, it's important to mention that the MMs will try to stay delta-neutral. In other words, they will start buying BEFORE the price hits strike price. When the MMs sold $800 strike options while the price was at $40, they calculated it would be a 1 in a million chance or something really low that GME would hit $800 by march 12th. However, now, that chance is approaching 1% and climbing. The MMs still don't need to cover fully, but they are starting to consider the CHANCE of it happening is becoming more and more likely. So for each option (remember each option is 100 shares) they may be already buying 1 share per option for the 1% chance of it happening. But this very act may CAUSE it to happen.\n\nAt some point, this is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Because MMs are 'insuring' their bets by buying shares just in case the price goes up, the price actually goes up, which means they need to insure even more, which creates a snowball effect. All the way up to, or beyond, the last option, which is at strike price $800.\n\nSimilarly, the MMs probably considered it about maybe 5% likely that GME would hit 300 this week, but now it's more like 95% like, which means for each option contract with STRIKE 300, they will be buying 90 shares BEFORE the price hits 300 (which means about a million shares bought, which may actually cause the price to reach 300 in the first place!) They do this because they will be worse off when they have to buy in AFTER the price reached PAST 300 (then they will DEFINITLY make a loss). At least if they buy in BEFORE the price reaches $300, they can still make a profit or at least cut their losses.\n\nRemember, all parties are TRYING to make money, but not all of them succeed. So MMs are the ones driving the rally you have seen for the past few days, and looking at the above table, this will likely push the price towards, and likely over $800 either this week, or next week.\n\nYou can also see in some particular numbers there's a LOT of shares that need to be covered, expect a lot of action when we APPROACH those numbers (for example, $300, $350, $400, $420, $500 and of course $800) as you can see, some of those numbers are close, and a gamma squeeze looks inevitable at this point.\n\n# This is only the GAMMA SQUEEZE. Now what about the short squeeze?\n\nSome people ask: \"Why don't the shorts just wait for the rally to be over, and buy when the price drops back to normal levels?\" Simple answer: they can't. Melvin was already down 53% the last time and they didn't even cover (that was just a gamma squeeze, by their own words). When a hedge fund has a short position, they can keep that position, as long as they have enough other assets to cover themselves. If the price of the asset they are short increases drastically (like in the event of a gamma squeeze), they will be FORCED to buy. As an example, let's say Hedge Fund M has $100 billion worth of assets, and shorts Company G for $1 billion at $10 per share. Now the price goes to $1000 per share, so they need to cover $100 billion for their shorts. This is an unacceptable risk, as their shorts are now losing more money than their entire portfolio can cover. So they will be forced to liquidate their assets and buy the shares they shorted. However, this very act will drive up the price (if you want to know how, read up on order books and slippage, this post is getting long enough as it is).\n\nIn fact, this would usually happen long before they reach the point of bankruptcy, but seeing as Melvin managed to lose 53% and still didn't cover, it seems likely Melvin is too stubborn to cut their losses, and will ACTUALLY go bankrupt. This will leave the responsibility to cover with the clearing houses. The clearing houses are sure as hell not going to gamble (I'm pretty sure that's illegal). So the clearing houses would cover IMMEDIATLY, regardless of costs. Even if the feds literally has to print the money out of thin air. So TL;DR, it's a short squeeze because the shorts are FORCED to buy back their shorts, one way or another. Since they need to buy back hundreds of millions of shares (while only about 50 million or fewer are available) this will be \"name your price\" kind of prices. This is where $100k is NOT a meme.\n\n# IMPORTANT LAST POINT:\n\n**Don't lose hope when the squeeze does not happen this week or the next, there are still lots of other triggers that can happen in the near future. Remember, it doesn't cost us anything to HODL, but it does cost them a lot to SHORT. Every day they are losing MILLIONS. Every day we keep the price above $0 is a WIN for us.**\n\n~~Edit: those who still doubt $100k because it would make the market cap too high, DRYS went to $1.5 BILLION PER SHARE during a short squeeze. Let that sink in~~. That was a reverse stock split so not exactly relevant.","957":"Why Gamestop is still undervalued today First we can take a quick walk through the history of how this all started, and explain how none of what's happening was \"our fault\". GameStop had, admittedly, followed a pretty outdated business model since the early 2010s. The gaming industry, like many others, was moving digital and Gamestop lagged far behind this trend.\n\nHedge funds, rightfully so to an extent, began shorting Gamestop in 2016. They began shorting it around $40 and rode the wave down. But they kept getting more and more greedy. Yadda yadda, sub-$4 and 140% short.\n\nDeep Fucking Value, Michael J Burry and others saw how undervalued Gamestop was at $4, and they started buying and HODLing shares. Just how undervalued were they when people started catching on in 2019\/2020? Well, at the end of 2019, Gamestop had about $1.6B in cash and about $800M in debt - or a net cash position of +$800M. The market cap of Gamestop was $276M when the share price was $4. Completely ignoring any future cash flows, you could purchase a share worth nearly $12 in cash for $4. *Hedge funds were still shorting the stock at this point.*\n\nSkip forward, Ryan Cohen becomes the catalyst that Sparks the shitkeg of short squeeze that hedge funds created, and off we went. Ryan Cohen, and his team, are the key. And what this thesis relies on **is already happening.**\n\nRyan Cohen and his team have begun taking over the board in what seems to be an amicable fashion. At least in the sense that it is not a hostile takeover. They've already ousted their dead weight CFO and have put in motion the new company vision to be an e-commerce retailer first, physical location game distributor second. That seems like a difficult transition to make...\n\nExcept Gamestop already has an online presence, already does e-commerce, has over 56 million subscribers to their online membership and increased their e-commerce sales by nearly 400% YoY **BEFORE Ryan Cohen became involved.**\n\nSo what's so special about Ryan Cohen? Well.. let's chew on that question for a second. *He turned a pet good company into a $30billion+ e-commerce giant.* Which gets us into the fundamentals. How does the market typically value e-commerce businesses? Many of them don't actually make a profit every year. They're valued based on future growth potential, usually based on a multiple of sales. Because e-commerce doesn't come with the overhead of physical retailers, investors will tolerate negative earnings in order to invest in rapid sustained growth, counting on them eventually becoming profitable.\n\nLet's start with Chewy. In 2020, they did $6.46B in revenue and -$174M in net income. They're trading at a market cap of almost $34B, which is just over five times their revenue. Seems fairly reasonable.\n\nLet's check in on our favorite gaming destination. In 2020, they did $5.16B in revenue and -$275M in net income. Not far off from Chewy, especially when you consider how much of Gamestop was still brick and mortar during a pandemic (oh and Chewy being fully e-commerce during a pandemic). GameStop, even after today, is trading at a market cap of $17B, which is just over three times revenue.\n\nSo two e-commerce companies. One built by Ryan Cohen, and one currently being led by Ryan Cohen. Trading at very different multiples. If we applied Chewys multiple to Gamestop, we would get a market cap of about $26B or a share price of about $377. That's a fair market value shareprice. **$377**. That does not consider a gamma or short squeeze at all. That is simply an efficient market pricing it as it should be valued.\n\nLet's check some other e-commerce companies to make sure we are being reasonable.\n\n- EBAY trades at a multiple of 3.72 times revenue\n- ETSY trades at a multiple of 15.11 times revenue\n- PINS trades at a multiple of 23.20 times revenue\n- AMZN trades at a multiple of 4.00 times revenue\n\nThere are clearly outliers, on the high side. Industry norms are typically 3-5x revenue for established businesses. When you anticipate strong near-term growth, as in the case of ETSY and PINS, you can see significantly higher multiples.\n\nUsing these valuations, we can confidently say that Gamestop is currently flirting with the low end of fair value, and has about 40% upside if we view them as an established business without extraordinary growth expectations. Except. We kind of do expect them to grow.\n\nHave I mentioned that nobody is considering their access to the e-gaming industry? Becoming a sponsor, or even facilitator of e-sporting events. Leagues, championships, etc. E-sports is a global industry that currently sees about $1B in revenue annually. This is expected to grow exponentially over the next decade, with most projections putting growth at 50-60% within the next two years, and continuing beyond that. Gamestop already has a Gamestop Performance Center, which is essentially a venue used for hosting major e-sporting events, as well as a host for training facilities. They've already tapped the market before Ryan Cohen, and his team will be able to truly capitalize on the market.\n\nThen we have live streaming, and potential acquisitions. At some point, it's likely that they will do an offering to raise capital. Spoiler, they don't currently need capital, but could deploy equity capital toward specific initiatives. Like purchasing an established platform to distribute electronic game downloads. Or purchase an established platform for live streaming. These initiatives don't have to be through acquisitions, but if they choose to, they will be able to afford to.\n\nOh yeah, PC gaming as well. It's been confirmed by several here and elsewhere that Gamestop is adding a feature to many of their stores. A \"Build-A-PC\" workstation. You can buy parts and build your PC in the store. The PC gaming industry is currently $38billion annually. It's expected to grow another 10% in the next few years. Another industry with rapid growth potential that Gamestop has already tapped into.\n\nWhat does this all mean? It means that if we consider Gamestop to be an e-commerce retailer with modest growth potential, the fair market value is somewhere between $230-385 a share. If we got wild and said they had the growth potential of something like ETSY, they would be worth $1,121 per share. I'd say they have room for more than modest growth, but not quite the potential of ETSY. Let's use about 5.6 as a multiple which would give us a **fair market value of $420 per share.**\n\n#Tl;dr: Based on Gamestops full commitment to being an e-commerce retailer, the fair market value of the company is between $15-26billion, or a share price of $230-385.\n\nBy the way, this is completely ignoring the fact that we are in the midst of repeated small gamma squeezes and a looming mother of all short squeezes. As a long term investment, Gamestop has the potential to be trading close to and above $400 per share. That is if the market is truly efficient and values Gamestop **based on fundamentals and no outside factors.**\n\nIf interested, I also did a rough analysis earlier on what the potential outstanding cost to fulfill call options are: [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/m1kvmx\/cost_of_shares_to_fulfill_open_call_options\/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=mweb)\n\n*This DD is based on information publicly available and my own interpretation of that information.

What Michael Burry found out, in particular, was that not a single GameStop was in the red; they were all making profit to some degree.\n\nAfter GME starting showing positive trends, people like Ryan Cohen and companies like Microsoft invested in the company as well. With these investors in the company, there was hope for GameStop to not go bankrupt and actually adapt with the rise of eCommerce.\n\nFinally, to really help GME go along, Microsoft and Sony announced that their latest consoles (the XBOX One X and PS5) were still going to support physical disc copies of games. This further gave reason to believe that full-digital wasn't the future just yet, and that there was still hope and profit to be had in physical products\/locations.\n\n# And as GME started going up to most people's surprise, people started noticing how screwed shorters suddenly were...\n\nBut before we continue, I need to briefly explain what a *\"short squeeze\"* and *\"gamma squeeze\"* is. **If you already know, you can skip below.**\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**A \"short squeeze\" is when lots of people \"short\" shares, yet the price of the stock they shorted continues to go up, and eventually they're forced to cover their positions.**\n\n**This allows those with shares to sell the shares back to them at ridiculously high prices because, well, they have to buy them back.**\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**A \"gamma squeeze\" happens when many people make lots of  \"call\" options with market makers for prices that are very high to reach (ex. a $100 call for a stock worth $10).**\n\n**They do this in hopes that not only will the stock attain that set price or higher, but more importantly that the market makers don't actually have the shares to give to them if\/when the call options can be exercised.**\n\n**If this high volume of \"call\" options does get exercised, and market makers don't have the shares for them, that means that they'll be forced to buy the shares.

And they provided the high volume indeed...**\n\n# And thus began the GME Gamma Squeeze of January 2021\n\nWhat was once a $3-4\/share company destined for bankruptcy suddenly sky-rocketed to a max of $480+ essentially overnight, and shorters and bears suddenly found themselves in billions worth of losses.\n\n# But we all know that big guys don't play nice.\n\nBefore more call options could be filled and the price of GME could go up any further, numerous brokers halted buying GME all together. This gave plenty of time for numerous \"call\" options to become worthless, and for shorters to regroup and recover their losses.\n\nAfter all, the DTCC gives a 21 day grace period for investors in huge debt to cover their positions, so these shorters were going to do everything they could within these 21 days to get the price of GME back down. This way, they could not only minimize their losses, but even get back into the green and continue to bankrupt GameStop.\n\nIn less than a month, GME plummeted to $40\/share, and all seemed lost. Hedge funds would win once again, and retail traders were given a grim reminder that they don't play by the same rules as the big players...\n\n# Yet this is not how GME ends.\n\nJust a few weeks ago, more hope was given that GME would rocket once again.\n\nKeith \"Roaring Kitty\" Gill proved that not only did he still hold all his original shares in GME, he also doubled down on his position right after he announced that he would still buy GME during a Congress Hearing.\n\nDuring the same Congress Hearing, Melvin Capital (a hedge fund that lost 53% of its value because of the GME Gamma Squeeze) admitted that there was no short squeeze, and that the rise of GME to $400+ was a result of a gamma squeeze.\n\n**In other words, a \"short squeeze\" hasn't happened yet.**\n\nPeople found that shorts theoretically didn't all cover as shorters continued to be greedy and likely held on to their shorts as they thought they could still bankrupt GME like they originally planned.\n\nThey found that while short interest was seemingly much lower that there were still very few GME shares left to short and that shorters were still losing millions every time GME spiked to new level highs.\n\nNot only that, but that shorters likely continued to short as GME went down during the gamma squeeze; putting them in an even bigger short position than the last.\n\nRyan Cohen made it official that he would be heading GameStop's eCommerce division (because of course he is)...\n\nThere were meme tweets of ice cream, frogs, and 1980-90's games\/movies...\n\nPeople began exercising call options once more, and now...\n\n# The GME rocket rises once again...\n\n# TL;DR: Shorters and Market Makers are currently in desperate positions where they need A LOT of shares of GME to cover their shorts and fulfill their \"call\" options, and retail investors (but most importantly big players) are buying and holding all the shares they can to make GME the Big Squeeze of the 21st Century.\n\n# NONE OF THIS IS FINANCIAL ADVICE, AND PURELY FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES.

However, that was just one side of the story, and there was an even more troubling 2008-style flaw in the system the GME has revealed in our financial system; something that first interested me when Thomas Peterffy, the founder and chairman of Interactive Brokers mentioned it on CNBC.\n\n*Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion and for ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up and with some satire thrown in. Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*\n\nFirst, let\u2019s go on a history lesson about the 2008 Financial Crisis and one of the main factors in it - Counterparty Risk.\n\n# What is Counterparty Risk?\n\nCounterparty Risk is the likelihood that the counterparty (i.e. entity on the other side) of the transaction might default on an obligation. To put it simply, imagine Bob sells Alice one GME call with a $10 strike price. Unfortunately for Bob, some \ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d in an obscure subreddit sent GME \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf1d so when those calls expire, GME is at $410, meaning Bob now owes Alice $40K. However, Bob\u2019s entire portfolio is worth only $10K and is unable to fulfil his financial obligation when he wrote those GME calls, defaulting on it.\n\n# Counterparty Risk in 2008 & the \u201cSolution\u201d\n\nThis is exactly what happened in the 2008 Financial Crisis when AIG sold Credit Default Swaps (basically, puts on the housing market) and defaulted on their financial obligations when the housing market collapsed. It made everything worse, because other funds were using these CDS to hedge their own positions in the housing market, so when those CDS turned out to be worthless because the other side was bankrupt, it endangered the financial soundness of firms like Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, BoA and Marril Lynch who bought these swaps. This suddenly created a counterparty risk to anyone on the other sides of all the trades they have made, and has a domino effect that ends up with basically every financial institution collapsing if AIG collapses; in other words, AIG was too big to fail.\n\nTitle 7 of Dodd Frank, which was the law passed by Congress as a response to the Financial Crisis to prevent this from ever happening again, mandates that all securities and derivatives be cleared in clearing houses such as DTCC and post collateral they deem to be sufficient to manage counterparty risk to them. These clearing houses would then be responsible for ensuring a transaction is fulfilled on both sides, and if one of the parties in the transactions fail to meet their obligation, they are responsible for honoring it.\n\n# Why this doesn\u2019t really work\n\nWhat this solution has effectively created is one monolithic central counterparty in the form of the DTCC. According to their [2019 annual report](https:\/\/www.dtcc.com\/annuals\/2019\/financial-performance\/), they processed $2.15 quadrillion worth of securities in 2019, or 24 times the global GDP of $24T and 6 times the total net worth of the world of $360T. Basically, they\u2019re way too big to fail. So to make sure this never happens, they have pretty broad authority to unilaterally decide how much collateral each participant based on their outstanding trades using an unknown and obscure formula.\n\nThis is how Robinhood got fucked over by them - their collateral requirements for the DTCC suddenly increased ten-fold on them, and they had a liquidity crisis (which they tried really hard not to admit, because this is the brokerage equivalent of your bank saying they're running out of cash and you might not get your deposits back) because they didn\u2019t have enough cash to cover it. What happens if a participant can\u2019t meet their collateral requirements? Similar to a degenerate options gambler who can\u2019t meet their margin call (aka your average [r\/wallstreetbets](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/) \ud83e\udd8d), their entire portfolio gets liquidated.\n\nSee, DTCC not only is a central clearing house that guarantees most settlements; technically that\u2019s the NSCC, which is a subsidiary \/ service provided by the DTCC. Their main operations are the equivalent of a central bank for brokerages - the broker of brokers, responsible for holding the physical shares that the brokerages own; hence their name Depository Trust Clearing Corporation.\n\nSo what does it take to bring the DTCC down? Most recently, GME. For those who haven\u2019t seen it yet, this interview with the Chairman of Interactive Brokers (apparently post gets auto-deleted if I put a YouTube link, but should be easy to find) on why they halted buying of GME outlines the issue pretty clearly. For those with too short of an attention span to click the link, he basically says\n\n* The most important reason why he halted GME purchases was to protect the integrity of the financial system and clearing houses\n* There were ALOT of options that suddenly became in the money, and whoever held them suddenly were owed a bucket of tendies; he mentioned $10-15B losses in one expiry date alone.\n* These tendies need to come from somewhere. Anyone who was net short GME got absolutely fucked and might defaulting on their short position or call option write.\n* If they default, the broker is on the hook to pay out those losses. If the broker cannot pay for it, they go under and clearing house (DTCC) is on the hook\n\n# Tin Foil Hat Time\n\nNow here\u2019s where I\u2019ll start speculating on what exactly happened on the other side of the trade and DTCC. So, who\u2019s on the other side of all these GME calls, or in other words, who wrote all these calls and suddenly owes fuck ton of money when GME \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf1d? Probably Citadel, which is involved in [over 99% of all options trading volume](https:\/\/www.citadelsecurities.com\/products\/equities-and-options\/). Now in theory, Market Makers are not in the business of taking a position and should be delta-neutral in all positions they take.\n\nHowever, delta and gamma hedging is a tricky art and probably not possible to perfect, especially in situations where a ticker suddenly becomes irrationally volatile, has large gaps between sessions (i.e. the opening price is significantly above or below the previous closing) and when the underlying is illiquid relative to the notional exposure value. I\u2019m too lazy to actually research this data, although I\u2019m almost certain this is true (someone pls fact check me), but it\u2019s extremely likely that at a certain point, the amount of shares Citadel needed to buy to remain fully delta hedged on all the options they wrote exceeded the available float, and became literally impossible to do.\n\nThis is because a large portion of the options they wrote were out-of-the-money, meaning that although they don\u2019t need to buy a lot of GME shares when they first sell the contract to be delta-hedged, they would need to drastically purchase more and more shares if GME goes up, causing it to go up even more and becoming a vicious cycle (i.e. gamma squeeze). Usually, market makers might use other strategies like buying similar tickers or ETFs holding GME to try to remain delta neutral, but there\u2019s so much volatility that it\u2019s possible that Citadel was in fact net delta-negative on GME - on in other words, they lost money if GME goes up.\n\nOkay, so let\u2019s make a logical jump (with no evidence) to speculate an idea - what if **Citadel\u2019s financial soundness came into question?** In other words, what if they were at risk of bankruptcy and ended up defaulting on their financial obligations? Well, they\u2019re involved with over 99% of all options trades, and if they default then the DTCC is suddenly on the hook for unwinding their massive portfolio and ensuring that all of Citadel\u2019s financial obligations, including paying out all those GME calls, are met.\n\nObviously, DTCC does not want this to happen, and as a private corporation, they are allowed to do whatever is in their best financial interest to preserve their own financial soundness to ensure their business is not at risk that is allowed within the financial regulatory framework they operate in - including raising GME margin requirements.\n\n*TLDR; DTCC is definitely too big to fail, so they get broad sweeping powers by financial regulation to make sure they don't fail. Citadel is probably too big to fail in DTCC's eyes because they don't want to be responsible for honoring 99% of all options transactions.*","965":"This Missionary of $GME has Converted the Family, next the neighborhood?

I'm sure this will be get down-voted to hell, but here it goes ..\n\nHere on \/r\/wsb, there is a fair amount of bearish sentiment that retail will be bagholders on GME ultimately, but there seems to be a lot more enthusiasm on it. The trajectory of GME's ascent this time feels different from the previous time, little volume on most days, less volatility than before, a much lower interest rate on borrowing to short.\n\nApart from the possibility that a) the HFs have given up, or b) the shorts have already been squeezed (mostly) and retail is actually just bidding up the stock against themselves while thinking that the HFs are on the other side (fairly large daily volume makes that less likely, but you never know), what are some opinions on here about what the hedge-funds are up to? If they are still exposed to risk, they seem to be playing it differently this time. They have a lot of really smart people working for them, and a lot of capital, so even accepting that they are greedy and fallible, they must have a plan for how to try to extricate themselves from this situation with as little a loss as possible.\n\nHow do you think they'll do it?","970":"Thank you all and keep up the good fight!  \n\nDear Apes.\n\nWatching the GME stock market launch from my POV in the side lines is the best euphoria I had in a long time.

Yes short sellers are that fucking retarded. So my ~~colleague~~ wifes boyfriend, who has no reddit account and wishes to have no association with you autists, has been doing some maths (or \"math\" for you americans, or \"fun hobby time\" for our chinese autists) in an attempt to back solve Short interest, using short volume & trading volume. The base idea behind his findings was that any short volume over 50% cannot be 100% covered that day... so he just thought - how much can these short boys actually cover, if all shorts opened were intended to be covered...\n\nHere's what he's worked out spoiler alert:>!shorts r more fuk than bears!<\n\n\"So, I have been freaking the fuck out about this.  I am of the belief that at one point, FINRA said the truth about SI%... Being 226% on the 15th of january.  I had thought it was impossible to figure out what it was now, but then I started digging into the Short Volume.\n\nAt first, I had thought that it would be interesting if we could see how much they could have covered if 100% of long volume transfers went to covering shorts (Short Overflow)...\n\nSo then, I got a thought... let me manually import the short volume data since the 15th and see where this could go.\n\nSo from the FINRA report I got:\n\n* Short Volume\n* Short Exempt Volume\n* Exchanged Volume (Long Volume + Short Volume)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/qvqwl2rw31m61.png?width=1158&format=png&auto=webp&s=7fb1fbc9c5fbb7971d179d9f982ad75d54287d63\n\nFrom Yahoo Historical Data I got:\n\n* Total Trade Volume\n* Day's Closing\n* Day's low\n\nThen I calculated this: Total Short Volume (SV + SEV)\n\n* Long Volume (ExV - SV)\n* SV% (TSV \/ EV)\n* Off Exchange Volume (TV - EV)\n* Short Overflow (TSV - LV)\n\nI realized that this all cost them a fuck ton.\n\nSo I said:  If they covered through calls, then they as an extreme minimum paid 40$\/share for them AND only would do so when GME was on the way up as it would be a waste of money otherwise. Thus I made MinimalCost of OFF-Exchange as (OEV \\* $40).\n\nIf they covered through Long Volume on market, then we'd be able to estimate that CONSERVATIVELY by comparing the days low to the Daily long volume (Day's Low \\* LV).\n\nThen came to the conclusion of the data:\n\nI wrote down the FINVIZ float, the SI% from FINRA, and derived the Short Volume at the time. THEN, I made 3 tables:\n\n* Table 1: Shows how many Shorts are there at different intervals of covering on Off-market and On-market.\n* Table 2: Shows the cost of doing those coverings.\n* Table 3: Shows the new SI%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/d05jq0jx31m61.png?width=1806&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b1309f6e677e016ba1dbc04208dc8eb0b4ed665\n\nIN CONCLUSION:   Using My data, I was able to derive that the **535.9% SI%** being passed around would cost Short Sellers 25 BILLION DOLLARS theoretically.\n\nThe **Maximum SI% can be rn is 942.06%.**\n\nIt is **litterally impossible for it to be under 200% rn** as it would be too costly.\n\nI believe that SI% is over 600%, as I believe that certain companies ran while they could, spending 10 billion dollars AT MOST between them all for covering.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/zyzechcy31m61.png?width=1275&format=png&auto=webp&s=e79ea03302ad64646162736f3f9a39843cc484fe\n\nBecause you cannot justify over 20% of long volume transfers being covering, its mostly algos and day traders as for calls, I just dont see that going over 30% as its abundantly clear calls are being used against them, not for them. and even that is pushing it.\n\nMy point for my want is this: I**t is impossible that SI% is not more than 226%** as was said on the 15th as the costs would be to great and the data is just not there to support it but instead I came to the conclusion that we are way fucking past that for simmilar reasons\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/bfuqksue31m61.png?width=1448&format=png&auto=webp&s=3db05997bf1b3d2c6b909b8994888cab21464829\n\nNOTE: NONE OF THIS EVEN TAKES INTEREST INTO ACCOUNT FOR THEIR COSTS, IT IS ALL JUST THEORETICAL COVERING COSTS ALONE.

If you buy a stock - hold onto it, even if you have a loss.\n\n2 - Being impatientThis directly correlates with the one above. I barely had any patience and trust in $GME - which is understandable, there is a lot of movement, but the most gains were done using patience.\n\n3 - Not informing myself when to get in our outI always noticed a lot of fluctiation around popularity. When $GME was less reported (for example, in news and generally less activity) it started falling, quite a lot. Especially once the news make fun of us apes for having losses.\n\n4 - Not checking out wsb (Not looking at who you're with)  \nThe most motivating thing in this entire short squeeze was looking at this sub. All the memes made me strong, we are strong together. Believe it or not, those made me less stressed. I just didn't bother looking at who I was investing with.

My take on this DD is a bit different to my usual format as I've decided to focus on the Technical analysis side of GME this time around. Why? Because you apes couldn't contemplate words so now I'm using colourful crayons and pictures instead. As always, I've inserted a TLDR for the autists but I do recommend reading it since it'll also help grow your knowledge of TA.\n\n# Pivot Point\n\nThe pivot **point, support and resistance calculations are widely accepted as the simplest yet most effective trading strategy.** They are well trusted by traders, banks and all financial institutions as clear indicators of the strength or weakness of the market. *They are used as the basis for most technical analysis*. **The pivot point is the point in which the market sentiment changes from bearish to bullish.**\n\nFor example, let's look at the candlestick chart for a ticker that I took from tradingview,\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Example Candlestick Chart](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/cdv56c1km0m61.jpg?width=873&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=83757b1f0769e06ca5f27ffeb1da8ac08bbe8601)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nR1 = (2 x Pivot Point) \u2013 Daily Low\n\nR2 = Pivot Point + (Daily High \u2013 Daily Low)\n\nS1 = (2 x Pivot Point) \u2013 Daily High\n\nS2 = Pivot Point \u2013 (Daily High \u2013 Daily Low)\n\n*R3 = Daily High + 2 x (Pivot Point \u2013 Daily Low)*\n\n*S3 = Daily Low \u2013 2 x (Daily High \u2013 Pivot Point)*\n\n**LINKING BACK TO GME**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Pivot Point Data were taken from Investing.com](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/rbjrco9nm0m61.jpg?width=976&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3f917346de8cdbbc3f5e333edb8b6073831cd1a9)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGME-\n\nResistance Line 1: $195.13\n\nResistance Line 2: 202.33\n\nResistance Line 3: 215.87\n\n*While writing this post $GME was hovering around $217* in pre-market (Which is higher than the current R3 value), all though the value is bound to change before the market opens, if $215 can be maintained during the opening; that **will ultimately see Resistance Level 3 becoming the new support line. This would depict a very strong bullish trend that can be aided by the RSI (Relative strength index)**\n\n*You can ignore the Fibonacci, camarilla etc PP if you're new to TA but they basically show the same trend of the ticker having an uptrend.*\n\n# Relative Strength Index\n\n*The relative strength index (RSI) is a* *momentum indicator* *used in technical analysis that measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions* in the price of a stock or other asset. The RSI is displayed as an oscillator (a line graph that moves between two extremes) and can have a reading from 0 to 100\n\nRSI below 30: Oversold, will rebound and may show divergence\n\nAbove 70: Overbought\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[GME RSI between march 4th and 8th](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/7ropbgzsm0m61.jpg?width=1201&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2c7ae49ff044332e81020f8404647aa973073a99)\n\nCurrent GME RSI value: 68 (Neutral)\n\n*The data shows RSI value continuing in an uptrend (bullish) and is in line with the price of $GME as no divergence could be seen. Coupling it with the pivot points, if the same trend continues today and tomorrow we'll see a breakout and support lines forming around $215+*\n\n**Disclaimer: My predictions are just me speculating and do not necessarily mean they are right. The increased volatility with low float means the price could go in any directions. But the indicators seem to be showing a healthy direction for a bullish market.**\n\n**Now comparing this to the RSI before January squeeze:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[RSI before jan squeeze](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/8otntoxum0m61.jpg?width=455&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fda45bc0fd98a78cea2e04d90c88ed9187a36d91)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRSI Value: 72.14\n\nAs seen from the second image, RSI trend before the breakout was in an uptrend. However, the slope was not as steep as we're currently seeing right now and when the price really started getting high, RSI showed a massive overbought. Comparing this back to the march RSI, that trend is still in the neutral territory and has potential for a more violent uptick as RSI value reaches the 70-75+ region.\n\n# Volume Weighted Average Price\n\nThe volume-weighted average price (VWAP) is a trading benchmark used by traders that gives the average price security has traded throughout the day, based on both volume and price.\u00a0*It is important because it provides traders with insight into both the trend and value of security.* Large institutional buyers and mutual funds use the VWAP ratio to help move into or out of stocks with as small of a market impact as possible. Therefore, when possible, institutions will try to buy below the VWAP, or sell above it. **This way their actions push the price back toward the average, instead of away from it.**\n\n*VWAP calculates the sum of price multiplied by volume, divided by total volume.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[VWAP January 13th-22nd](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/jcps124xm0m61.jpg?width=131&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=67dbb4877f7fa69b17429839bfa967c605d2b08d)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[VWAP March 1st-8th](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/s2sqhq2ym0m61.jpg?width=324&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d2916f02390c863ea8b815eaca847d618766f51e)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Blue Line indicates the volume-weighted average price. **Comparing both pictures, the vwap value in regards to each candlestick seems to show the same pattern.**\n* VWAP has been above the average day trading price between 6 and 7th March, this seems to act like the support line for the price.\n* **8th march and 22nd January show a similar pattern, both had a relatively significant increase in (=increased volatility and more violent price swings) as well as a positive slope gradient.**\n\n# Moving Average Convergence Divergence\n\nMACD is a trend-following [momentum](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/m\/momentum.asp) indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security\u2019s price. The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-period [exponential moving average](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/e\/ema.asp) (EMA) from the 12-period EMA. A nine-day EMA of the MACD called the \"signal line,\" is then plotted on top of the MACD line, which can function as a trigger for buy and sell signals. **Traders may buy the security when the MACD crosses above its signal line.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[MACD january](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/akhuo1g1n0m61.jpg?width=311&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=32ae04bfcde02eb35d592de58a87f48053cda122)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[MACD march](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/l0cu7ez2n0m61.jpg?width=553&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5b836600d1bb2bac2c97aa6a10a97607381532f8)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMACD is often displayed with a histogram (see the chart below) which graphs the distance between the MACD and its signal line. If the MACD is above the signal line, the histogram will be above the MACD\u2019s baseline.\n\n* **MACD in January showed a gradual increase till breakout, the march macd value is much stronger in regards to the trend and can see the signal line deviating away from the EM**A.

Do all us a favor and head over to [PowerUp Rewards - Rewards Center | GameStop](https:\/\/www.gamestop.com\/poweruprewards\/rewards-center\/) and sign up for $15 a year subscription, millions of new rewards members might look good on a balance sheet. \n\nNow the reason for the post; physical games are NOT going away. Why? Because they offer so much value in the re-sale world. Let me give an example, I own a Nintendo switch, in fact I own 2 (both bought at GameStop thank you) and I started playing Zelda Breath of the Wild. I made sure to buy the physical copy for one reason, I want to sell it back for trade in value when I\u2019m done. Currently there is **no option for reselling games purchased virtually**, not even a plan. Why would anyone want to buy a virtual game? The short answer is some people are just lazy and want it now, but if I can buy Zelda for $80 and sell it on ebay\/ offer up for $50 why would I ever buy virtual games?!?! Not everyone thinks about ROI, but I know most of you apes do. The resellers world is on fire and video games \u2013 even retro \u2013 are hot right now.

Analysis on Volume, MACD, and Short Availability. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80  \n\n**TLDR; Volume, MACD, and Short Availability are all extremely bullish for GME. HODL \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80.**\n\nHang on to your bags, this puppy is going higher. The technicals all point BULLISH signals and signify GME is going much higher.\n\n**Case 1 : VOLUME**\n\nLook at the volume and price action for the last few weeks. Volume was actually decreasing from Feb 25 to Mar 3, and the price went UP, this is extremely bullish. Typically, if price stays flat or up on decreasing volume, this is bullish.\n\nSecondly, since Mar 3, we have seen increasing volume with higher prices. This is bullish.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Holy shit! ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/40z53odskvl61.jpg?width=467&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=28bacefabefab34d59ba5a2cf2a64b132afdc484)\n\n \n\n**Case 2 : MACD**\n\nMACD stands for Moving Average Convergence Divergence and essentially shows the relationship between two moving averages. The crossover occurred when Ryan Cohen tweeted his infamous McDonald's vanilla ice cream cone photo (coincidence?). MACD shows strong momentum and is pointing GME to higher prices.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Looks Bullish](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/s30997zukvl61.jpg?width=493&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e200ddb9c0a88284cce5c7c430806e4eff11222d)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\n**Case 3 : AVAILABLE SHARES TO SHORT**\n\nFrom last Friday to today, the shares available to short have dropped a whopping 600,000 SHARES! Yet the price is up 35%+ today. This is extremely bullish, the shorts can't even drop the price given 600,000 shorted shares. Now keep in mind, this is counting the shares that are available to short, and does not include the millions of shares that are ALREADY shorted. If GME continues to climb higher, the short sellers may be margin called and forced to sell.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[600,000 shorted! ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/9aaem6vxkvl61.png?width=498&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c2e0447f1c71e3c441110abad4bc6cb712b2627)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nThere are a lot more tailwinds that can catalyze GME. This analysis doesn't even consider the possibility of another gamma squeeze or how many shares are now becoming ITM or \"In The Money\". This will require Market Makers to purchase additional GME shares if they don't have it in possession on exercise.\n\nThis also doesn't consider the fundamental change in the company and how to properly revalue GameStop from a traditional brick and mortar to an e-commerce player.\n\nThe technicals signify bullishness and you should continue HODL.

There is still enough shorts to help the price action upward and also enough to give stability to this big increases if they call it quits.\n\n**Implied Volatility (IV)** is up but the contract premiums during the first squeeze were significantly higher.  For example, on 1\/29 the stock was around $325 and the contract costs were:\n\nAt The Money (ATM) strike $325 1 wk option cost about $125\n\nToday....ATM strike $195 1 wk option cost about $30.\n\nTwo things, 1) there is much less IV b\/c this was a much slower and methodical rise albeit still over a short time period.  2) Since options premiums are still relatively cheap around $30 ATM I think (correct if wrong) they are still affordable enough to continue pressuring a gamma squeeze.\n\nImplied 1 wk move is 15% ($30\/$200) +\/-  based on the contract prices.  This is much better than the plus or minus 38% ($125\/$325) +\/- 1 wk move last time.\n\n**Technicals.**  I don't look at technicals but I'm thinking this is one view you can add to your technical view about where there is support and what the options market is pricing in.  The idea of this **falling back to $100 isn't supported by the options market.**\n\n**Edit:** I think this also shows that a short squeeze wasn't needed to get us where we are right now.  Which is good b\/c if it's a gamma squeeze then it's repeatable as we just witnessed.","980":"Lost money on boomer stocks?

For background, I work in one of the major finance companies, not on finance but with machine learning\/time series prediction, but I've lots of meetings with lots of people, and people talk. I can't give away too much info because it may cost my job, but the deep shit going on is over the charts, in 100 years this event will be spoken of.\n\n\nFirst of all, not all hedge funds shorted GME, this is important because of what is about to happen, some funds managers are actually selling the assholes of their wives and first born sons to banks to get loans, I'm speaking of exorbitant amounts, remember that 35% of the dollars ever printed were printed last year, guess who is going to get a big piece of that ? Why ? They want to be the bigger fish on the aquarium, WSB opened the door for few hedge funds to expand brutally by destroying others.\n\n\nMaybe people here didn't realize yet what they started, but it has epic proportions and you are living it right now. Second, big hedge funds are partnering up, but this is where comes the problem, imagine that you will try to rob a bank, what make you sure that the people that you partner with won't kill you to have less people to share the money with ? This is the current situation, this is the waiting, hedge funds, including the company that I work with are waiting for the money, and to see who they can trust. In the end they will all backstab each other, this is the finance industry, you can't deny it. Because soon as the price skyrocket to alpha centauri, guess who will be greedy to start another fucked up short ? Yes, the hedge funds, all over again, but is far easier to short at 750$, so is just a matter of who will short first. At work lots of people are absurdly greedy regarding shorting it, that was what created this opportunity, but some people never learn.\n\n\nThis is why you should hold, I'm holding just for fun and to see this shit show, if one day I sell, I will get the dollar bills and put in a frame in my wall, we are living the WW III of financial markets, now we are on the ships awaiting to arrive to the beach on a new D day, meanwhile some hedge funds are on our side (long, but don't think that they care about you as a person) coming with the atomic bombs. One risk that we escalated at work is that paper hands (as you like to call them) may sell leaving the other funds not vulnerable to a massive attack, rendering all this useless. Hold if you can, this is a game of patience, soon the direction will change, fucking huge buy orders will come and they will artificially inflate the price while other funds will have to think fast on get bankrup sooner, or be bankrupt later.\n\n\nCan't say much, but few funds already gave their CEOs and managers some quite fat bonuses, why ? This is the last song, last dance, they are looting the ship before it sinks. You have no reason to believe in me, I'm a random guy on the internet, but pay attention to the fucking events that are going on, and you will understand that this is much bigger than just making few bucks. If you put all of this together, you will see that the silence of operations (see the fucking low volume) means the silence before the storm. Wait to see the news of hedge fund managers hanging themselves\n\n\nIf you monkeys like to read some formal definition of this behavior, read this\n\n\nhttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Keynesian_beauty_contest\n\n\nIf you don't understand it, read again, this explains why you don't sell and you need to stick together","982":"What could be better for GME transition to online retailer than a massive story and the loyalty of tens of thousands of Redditors having a life changing experience with them?

Hope you are still interested.\n\n**Some remarks relating to the feedback I received on my previous post:**\n\n1. You retards did what 12 years of school education couldnt: I finally can spell squeeze correctly.- Appreciate it.\n2. That is actually all concerning general remarks. Just wanted to thank you for No. 1 and also: Great comment by [u\/Calithrix](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/u\/Calithrix\/). I actually tried to consolidate(collateralize) some of the previous DDs on GME. But please dont be Bear Stearns and just buy it instead try to do your own DD.\n\n**Why it could be dipping this week and why this would be a good thing?**\n\nSo lets start by answering why it is a good thing, if it actually dips this week. If the price is lower **delta** of options is actually **lower**, because the delta of an option has a positive correlation with the probability of being ITM for call options and being OTM for put options. And if the price is lower the probability that an call option becoming ITM or an put option becoming OTM is lower. For more info on that I just can again refer to [u\/Natural\\_Profession\\_8](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/u\/Natural_Profession_8\/) [post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/lz8mgr\/a_deepdive_on_the_actual_math_behind_gamma\/).\n\nAnd a **lower delta** means less shares already hedged, meaning if the price goes up again all of a sudden, more shares needed to be bought. It is easier to get it up for whales when the price is low and thats why they could let the price intentionally drop this week.\n\nAlso a dip could mean shorts are getting FOMO and open new shorts (Thats what happened the previous 5 years and led to the high Short interest in the first place).\n\n**Some other requirements for a squeeze**\n\n* You need definitely a catalyst for any squeeze. Here are some possible dates:\n\n1. 03\/24 Earnings\n2. 03\/08 Stimmy checks (actually today lol)\n3. find other possible catalysts in [u\/HeyItsPixeL](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/u\/HeyItsPixeL\/) post. (couldnt link cause of WSB guidelines but just look at his Endgame post with a lot of Upvotes)\n\n* It is actually not that important that a certain price is reached, it is more important that its going up fast. Then Delta is moving fast and MMs need to hedge fast.\n* Thats also the reason why I dont thinks short are gonna play a huge role in the squeeze. They are not forced by their programs to buy GME unless they are margin called for which we actually need an incredibly huge price increase. I am talking prices in the thousands, which could be reached by a gamma squeeze but not solely because of a catalyst.\n\n**Some final thoughts**\n\n* You probably already noticed Im less bullish than other DDs on GME here. With the reason for that being, that I actually believe most of the official number. Yeah I could be wrong about that and there is actually a huge conspiracy behind all of that. And Yeah I know there happened some crazy things. But these are actually all easily explainable without needing a conspiracy theory: A lot of people liked the stock and bought it, this caused some rapid price movement, which was supported by some gamma squeeze. Then RobinHood and other brokers had liquidity problems because they needed to come up with a few billion dollars. But no one wants the public to know, that you have liquidity problems, so you come up with excuses. It all makes sense.\n* Some words on the emotionalization about the stock: WSB being the Good \ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d with \ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd32 who are fighting the evil hedgefunds, who want to short GME into insolvency. I also love the story. But I stop liking the story, when people are actually betting their student loans on that shit. Its not that funny anymore then. With that being said, I hope all of you, who betted your student loans on it, will laugh at me soon from your Teslas (Hopefully theyll have enough production capacities, even with GIGA Berlin its going to be tight\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80), but try to bet only money you can lose next time. There is no such thing as certainty in the stock market (otherwise we wouldnt be here but already at the Tesla store) but there is the possibility and thats all that matters. \ud83c\udf1a\n\n**TLDR: MOON POSSIBLE BUT PROBABLY NOT THIS WEEK**","984":"UTZ Brand DD, am I doing this right? hey guys im trying to learn how do to do proper DD and was wondering if you could tell me if im screwing it up (i am a gme ape but actually want to learn how to do stocks right)  \n \n\nSo a few weeks ago when i was doing DD for GME I was checking a bunch of stocks that were heavily shorted, and UTZ was 55% shorted (sorry, no screenshots). So I started doing research on the company and they just hit the market last year in August and has been doing well since so why was it shorted so much? I for the most part just passively observed it for a bit. Fast forward to it today and it is shorted only 6% so I look at the stock and it dropped from 25.89 to 23.35 with 2m volume in 3 days and it is no longer shorted.

The more I think about it, the more pissed I've become about the subtle, manipulative, and just plain evil condescension.\n\n   \n \n\nThe writer sounded like they were writing a piece complimenting retail investors on our astute comprehension of the numbers.

But I wanted to explain a few things with the ultimate aim, that you dont need to do read any more DD but rather can do your own DD. As most of you cant read anyways, Ill put a TLDR with symbols at the bottom. So here we go.\n\n# General squezze theory (I know a lot of words but reading will make you a big brain \ud83e\udd8d)\n\nThere are two types of squezzes:\n\n* short squezze\n* gamma squezze\n\n**Short squezzes:**\n\nEvil Hedgefunds and MMs sell a stock, which they dont have, in hope they can buy it back cheaper. Now price goes up --> Hedgefunds have to cover to cut their losses. Otherwise there is the risk of unlimited loss, as stock price can go up infinitely. If they wait to long they get margin called, because their broker is in fear that they cant cover anymore. And no one wants to get [margin called](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/k9v5e9\/that_margin_call_notification_at_3am\/).\n\n**Gamma squezzes:**\n\nEvil MMs (and others) sell far OTM call options. Now price goes up and suddenly those options are ITM. MMs now have to buy the stock to cover their sold options making the price surge once again bringing new formely OTM options ITM, which then again leads to the price surging. This feedback loop is called a gamma squezze. For this to happen you need to have high numbers of OTM option sold at certain strike prices. Just enough, that the next strike price is reached. It is more likely that lower strike prices are reached. MMs know that, hence they have already hedged some of there sold OTM options with these lower strike prices. This is called Delta Hedging. That means you need higher number of OTM options with lower strike prices then of those with higher strike prices to keep the Squezze going.\n\nIf you want to go even deeper I suggest you look at u\/Natural_Profession_8 [post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/lz8mgr\/a_deepdive_on_the_actual_math_behind_gamma\/). He also did a formula, which you can use to calculate how to have the biggest leverage with option buying, meaning forcing MMs to buy the most shares with the purchase of option with a certain strike price.\n\nWhat you always need to keep in mind for both kinds of squezze that the price run up to trigger the squezze has to be rather fast. Otherwise, there is more time to cover shorts or hedge options and hence having less effect on the price.\n\n# Applying this to the current GME situation\n\n**Short squezze:**\n\nIm sorry to say that, but I dont think a squezze solely because of shorts covering will be happening any time soon. You have all seen how the short interest has dropped tremendously from the previous legendary 226%^(1) within the last to reporting dates to now 60%^(2).\n\n^(1: 01\/14\/21,) [^(Yahoo Finance)](https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/quote\/GME\/key-statistics?p=GME) ^(with Morningstar data, which suggests a Float of roughly 27M shares)\n\n^(2: 02\/11\/21,) [^(Yahoo Finance)](https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/quote\/GME\/key-statistics?p=GME) ^(with Morningstar data, which suggests a Float of roughly 27M shares)\n\n*\"But there was no volume?\".* Just look at the numbers. GME had a average Volume of 40.49M per day over the last three months. As a stock with roughly 70M shares outstanding thats a lot.^(3) AMZN had a 3 months average volume of 3.73M per day with roughly 7x the shares outstanding of GME.^(4) There was enough volume.\n\n^(3:)  [^(Yahoo Finance)](https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/quote\/GME\/key-statistics?p=GME)\n\n^(4:)  [^(Yahoo Finance)](https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/quote\/AMZN\/key-statistics?p=AMZN)\n\n*\"But what is with the institutional ownership?\"* You all probably all seen these posts, where its said \"Institutions solely hold xTimes Outstanding shares of GME. So there has to be massive short interest.\" (e. g. see [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/lz77ix\/gme_total_shares_owned_is_145m_according_to_finra\/)). But what most of these Posts are missing, that there often reporting delays in between ownership filing, which is causing these high numbers. If you compare it again to AMZN, you also have institutions owning 1.5x of shares outstanding. With a company called Russell Investments Group, LLC owning over 80% of AMZN shares.^(5) That should show you, that these FINRA numbers arent correct all the time. Especially with high volumes like in GME, there are a lot of Duplicates because of reporting delays.\n\n^(5:) [^(Finra)](https:\/\/finra-markets.morningstar.com\/MarketData\/EquityOptions\/detail.jsp?query=126:0P000000B7)^(, Tab: Shareholders)\n\nWith that being said, the amount of GME shares hold by Institutions still seems suspiciously high to me. And there are other things like the reported 111% Short interest in XRT^(6) or the still abnormally high Short interest in GME. That means remaining shorts could still be a nice catalyst for a possible gamma squezze.\n\n^(6:) [^(Etf channel)](https:\/\/etfchannel.com\/symbol\/xrt\/)\n\n**Gamma squezze:**\n\nA gamma squezze, often underestimated compared to his brother the short squezze. But I think this was the main reason for the surge in January and the surge last week. Especially last week was probably a well set up and executed option chain by big whales.\n\n*So how can \ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d profit from a gamma squezze?* Just take a look at the current option chains. u\/indonesian_activist did a great [excel sheet](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/lxkeg0\/repost_gme_squeeze_calculator\/), where you can see how many shares MMs have to buy if GME reaches a certain price. Just type in the current price and the projected price.\n\n^(Note: I did update his excel sheet with the new data, which you can find) [^(here)](https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1ZYGIff3Iq7UNyo88SVevj32rcYs0oqlS\/view?usp=sharing)^(. Also I added, an option on the cover, so that you can decide which Option expiring dates you want to include.)\n\n*But how many shares are enough to cause a gamma squeeze?* This is really hard to say, but according to u\/CoastalHotDog835 [post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/lycj6f\/gme_dd_part_2_taking_a_look_at_the_0603_calls\/). Last weeks surge had the following option volumes:\n\n>*1.86M shares at $55 = $102.3Million*  \n>  \n>*2.90M shares at $120 = $348Million*\n\nSo these are probably numbers we need to see again.\n\n^(Note: These are just two Strike prices. I can not say how much other options with other strike prices e. g. 100$ played a role nor do I know how high their volume was. Unluckily most sites dont have data for the past.)\n\n*So whats the current situation with GME options?*\n\nFor the options expiring the coming week, we need to have at least a doubling of the price to see the same amount of shares having to be bought by MMs compared with last weeks 55$ calls.\n\n^(Note: It is not fully sufficient compare these two numbers. On the one hand in the excel there are shares already hedged deducted, which decreases the numbers of shares. On the other hand there are not only options included with the projected strike price but all options. I hope, in the absense of better numbers for the option volumes of last week as already stated above, that these two effects could equalize each other.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Shares need to be bought by MMs if GME hits 300$ for options expiring 03\\\/12](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/jm8qjkjveml61.png?width=1488&format=png&auto=webp&s=541ebeaac563fad9fa536ba770d98f0566acc967)\n\nBut for the week after that it looks a lot better. Only a price of 190$ would be needed to see the same amount of shares having to be bought by MMs compared with last weeks 55$ calls. This is only a value increase of roughly 40%, which is very well possible.

Don't let TSLA and AAPL fool you I am not going to do the homework for you guys. Just go to any financial statistics website and look at the PE ratio of the majority of the stocks inside ETFS like QQQ. Their PE ratio and net revenue \/ cash flow to stock prices are not actually up but either stable or slightly lower. The only exception to this rule are meme stocks like TSLA, GME etc. AAPL is an exception too but AAPL's net revenue is quickly catching up. But ETFs and tech stock market in general are not in a bubble, you are looking at less than a handful of stocks to make this determination.\n\nYou guys are also forgetting that we are currently undergoing a technology revolution like never before. Covid-19 put technology in the forefront and it's like the invention of the steam engine right now. Everything in tech and the cyberspace in particular is literally going to skyrocket in the upcoming years. People who are going full time in right now will be the winners and history will know it. Jury is out for if these meme stocks are overvalued too because we don't know their future potential (TSLA, NIO etc - minority of the tech stocks). What is happening right now is that safe money is moving out of stocks and either into bonds or cash. Because of inflation cash is going to take a huge hit in a year or so when we finally have the figures for how much Covid-19 cost us in American dollars. So not only will people miss out on the huge gains post-tech revolution but they will also take a big hit for holding cash.\n\nI am not going to say if I am a financial expert or not. It is common sense. But I was never a part of these PLTR, GME and TLRY ponzi schemes. These people are worse than the hedge funds because they are just as greedy but far less educated \/ invested. It was a pyramid scheme where the first guy in took the most gains. I don't believe in something like a store that sells physical copies of video games to ever succeed rofl. Let's not forget Gamestop offering $3 for a game they would later sell for $40. All you bozos did was bail out the assholes that were invested in an asshole company and had poor retail investors take the hit for it. You people took advantage of depressed anxious jobless individuals and now many of them are left without much. I took a big hit from TSLA too (silly me). But I do believe in the cyberspace taking off big time in the upcoming years and it'd be the most valuable resource imaginable. You are seeing news right now about tech stocks being in a bubble over and over. You are also seeing news about some bond bullshit going up. It's the news that wants you to get out so the big whales can go in cheap - right before Biden administration goes all in on the clean energy and tech sector. Tech in the 1990s was nothing like it is now. India and China did not know what computers were back then, now every person has an iphone and tiktok in their hands. Cars are running on cyberspace\/cloud that did not exist back then. Revenue of tech companies dwarfes the oil giants. Currency itself is produced using technology (Cryptos). Globalism \/ latest tech and the cloud itself has become the most valuable resource not just in America but also in India and China which have 10x our population.

But I also like the stock \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude80 TLDR: VW's squeeze was very different to the coming GME squeeze and people should be careful of some maybe false promises here. \n\nHello fellow ape friends... As I have seen many many posts and comments where people compare VW with GME and because Germany and my great great great grandfather uncle A.H. (just kidding) fucked up the world so bad I see it as my duty as a german retarded ape to clear some things up:\n\nJust recently one particular post\/comment (Cant find it anymore) caught my eye where one of our fellow brothers said: Don't you worry about your exit strategy, you will have plenty of time to react, look at the VW squeeze that took forever as well. \n\nYes but....WRONG! \n\nI don't want to tell you the whole VW story now... You can find it in the magical world of the www (Wikipedia or whatever), but to sum the important facts up for you:\n\n(Translated from german Wikipedia):\n\n\"An example of a short squeeze is the price explosion of Volkswagen ordinary shares that began on October 27, 2008. [1] On October 26, 2008, the Porsche company announced that it had increased its stake in VW from 35% to 42.6% and, with options for a further 31.5%, would have a total stake of 74.1%. Speculators, especially hedge funds, had bet on falling prices and sold VW common shares short. Since the state of Lower Saxony held a further 20% of the VW shares, less than 6% of the VW shares remained freely tradable. The short sellers had borrowed 12% of the VW shares that they had to buy to repay the loan on the stock market. So they were in a short squeeze.\"\n\nIn Short:\n\nPorsche had 74,1%\n\nNiedersachsen (Lower Saxony - \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02), a \"state\" of Germany had 20%\n\nSo the free float available was at around only 6% and as mentioned above around 12% were borrowed. \n\nWhat's important here is: There were only TWO parties that had 94% of the stocks and they could just do whatever they wanted, it was very easy for them to just hold and the stock price went crazy for quite a long time,BUT: \n\nThere are millions of apes like me and dozens of Hedgies and what more that got GME stocks, and every single person or institution has its one target price\/planned sell price\/price tolerance or whatever you wanna call it. And when some people will start to sell (and they will) and there will be some big drops, more and more paper handed bitches will sell just like in the first squeeze and it will go down FAST. \n\nThats why you just can't compare those two at all and IMO the GME squeeze will happen much faster and you should really think deep about how and when you wanna exit this. \n\nTo give this a final personal touch: Because of all the DD I've seen so far (Some of them are extraodinary) and the many Call Options at 800$ and that potential Gama squeeze I personally see a chance of about 95,7931% of GME hitting 1.000$ but not that much more.... Please dont stone me for that. \n\nHowever I also see a chance of 4,2069% (You really just got it now?) of GME hitting 42.069$\n\nSince I am very new to Reddit let me Introduce myself: I am not a financial advisor, just a (german) retarded ape like you and I really like the stock!\n\n...Made 5k\u20ac at first squeeze, bought in again after first drop and bagholded and average priced dow a little since then: Now holding 67 x GME @ 100\u20ac \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude80\n\n...

Feel free to discuss, as I embrace the importance of evaluating a set of facts from various perspectives.\n\nIf you have not done so already, please read, or skim, the OP below, and pay homage to both [u\/dan\\_bren](https:\/\/new.reddit.com\/u\/dan_bren\/) and [u\/tapakip](https:\/\/new.reddit.com\/u\/tapakip\/) for their service in bringing this information to my attention. Once you\u2019ve done so, return here. If you\u2019ve read their posts already, proceed to the gates of Valhalla below.\n\n[$100MM of DEEP ITM GME CALLS have been purchased since 3\/1(Monday) : GME (reddit.com)](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GME\/comments\/lx5kgk\/100mm_of_deep_itm_gme_calls_have_been_purchased\/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't be a dick. Just skim it at least. Or my analysis won't make sense at first.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs [u\/tapakip](https:\/\/new.reddit.com\/u\/tapakip\/) points out in the comment below, there is a very strong presumption that these calls were all purchased by the same buyer. They are the only one purchasing calls that are this deep ITM within the last three days, and are all purchased out of the Philadelphia exchange. It's actually mindboggling to me that anyone would be willing to shell out this much premium and take on the exponential amounts of risk. All in all, it makes the most logical sense that these have all been bought by the same individual when considering the facts we have.\n\n[https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GME\/comments\/lx5kgk\/100mm\\_of\\_deep\\_itm\\_gme\\_calls\\_have\\_been\\_purchased\/gpl5wso?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GME\/comments\/lx5kgk\/100mm_of_deep_itm_gme_calls_have_been_purchased\/gpl5wso?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, as you know (I hope), each call option is the right to purchase 100x of the underlying. In the calculations below, I assume you know can comprehend the following equation:\n\n>Options x Strike = Exercise cost (x100)\n\nBefore you say some dumb shit in the comments, \\*\\*Do not confuse exercise cost with the purchase price of the actual option.\\*\\* We'll get there. Thanks in advance, dumbass.\n\n**3\/1\/2021 Purchases**\n\n* 540 x 12 = $648,000\n* 540 x 12 = $648,000\n* 1200 x 12 = $1,440,000\n* 600 x 12 = $720,000\n* 600 x 17 = $1,020,000\n* \\*515 x 7 = $360,500\n* \\*500 x 5 = $250,000\n\n**3\/2\/2021 Purchases**\n\n* 1200 x 12 = $1,440,000\n* 600 x 15 = $900,000\n\n**3\/3\/2021 Purchases**\n\n* 1,300 x 12 = $1,560,000\n* 600 x 15 = $900,000\n* 600 x 17 = $1,020,000\n* 580 x 12 = $696,000\n* 580 x 12 = $696,000\n* 550 x 12 = $696,000\n\nWhat do all of these add up to?\n\nI\u2019ll save you idiots the trouble. **It costs an additional $12,298,500 in order for this whale to exercise all of their calls.**\n\nNext, let\u2019s find out what this leviathan actually spent to acquire these options. Yes, asshole, now I am calculating the purchase price. Sorry for your inconvenience.\n\nNew equation:\n\n>Options x Price = Cost Basis (x100)\n\n**3\/1\/2021 Purchases**\n\n* 540 @ 98.45 = 5,316,300\n* 540 @ 96.05 = 5,186,700\n* 1200 @ 105.85 = 12,702,000\n* 600 @ 101.25 = 6,075,000\n* 600 @ 99.60 = 5,976,000\n* \\*515 @ 106.55 = 5,487,325\n* \\*500 @ 110.90 = 5,545,000\n\n**3\/2\/2021 Purchases**\n\n* 1200 @ 108.15 = 12,978,000\n* 600 @ 104.95 = 6,297,000\n\n**3\/3\/2021 Purchases**\n\n* 1,300 @ 108.40 = 14,092,000\n* 600 @ 105.15 = 6,309,000\n* 600 @ 103.15 = 6,189,000\n* 580 @ 107.15 = 6,214,700\n* 580 @ 107.15 = 6,214,700\n* 550 @ 109.00 = 5,995,000\n\nI won\u2019t even ask this time, I know you can\u2019t count that high. **It\u2019s a grand total of $104,582,725.** OP\u2019s estimate of $100MM was very close. To be blunt, that\u2019s a lot of cocaine and hookers.\n\n# \n\n# This is where things get interesting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, as OP also pointed out, **the buyer has the right to purchase 942,500 shares by April 16** (note: the options above with an \\* expire on Jan 20, 2023 and Jan 21, 2022, respectively). Nevertheless, they are all ITM, so the buyer can exercise them whenever they feel enlightened.\n\nLet\u2019s do some more math; apes love math. This behemoth has already shelled out \\~$104MM for these options and has the RIGHT, not obligation, to shell out an additional $12,298,500 for the actual shares.\n\n$104,582,725 + $12,298,500 = **$116,881,225 (purchase price + exercise price)**\n\nWe also know the total # of shares to be \\[potentially\\] exercised is 942,500.\n\nUsing this information, we\u2019ve (me, mostly) done enough work to extrapolate a rough break-even price for this colossus of clout buyer.\n\n**$116,881,225 \/ 942,500 = 124.01**\n\n# This big whale\u2019s total breakeven price lands at $124.01\/share.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShut the hell up. I know you just mumbled to yourself \"that\u2019s underwhelming as fuck.\" Just consider yourself a smooth brain. That's why I'm here.\n\nI will admit, that on its face, it might seem like I wasted all of our time. Now hit that joint or Moscow mule and ponder what it actually means\u2026\u2026\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWelcome back brother. If you couldn\u2019t think of anything, again confirming how smooth your brain is, let me help.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA *massive fucking buyer* just exposed themselves to an exorbitant amount of risk; they could LOSE *tens of millions* within minutes. With that in mind, I can guaran-fuckin-tee that nobody on this planet would over-leverage themselves in the amount of \\~$116,881,225 without having (A) some extremely important information or (B) some serious fucking diamond kahonas. My wager would be on the former, but also the latter.\n\n**In any case, anyone who drops \\~$116M over the course of three days has some deeeeeepfuckiinngggpockets. They have more money, that\u2019s a fucking fact.**\n\nCompound that with this buyer\u2019s breakeven at $124.01. **It logically follows, we have found our new BASELINE PRICE for GME.** Let me explain.\n\nConsider all this information with what happened yesterday. **GME CLOSED AT $124.18. JUST 17 CENTS ABOVE THIS BUYER\u2019s BREAKEVEN.**\n\nWhat ensued in AH? A back-and-forth teetertotter throughout the entire AH session. Ultimately, every time GME dropped below $124 it hit a springboard back above the closing price and finally finished at $125.00 flat.\n\nIn sum, I believe the new baseline price is $124.01. Relying on my aforementioned ability to deduce logical reasoning, I am resolute in my opinion that this big bag dickslanger will be valiantly defending his\/her breakeven price at $124.01. Do not get this confused with them giving a fuck about us or anyone else. They might, but its in their own best interest to hold that line, whether it benefits us or not is probably the least of their concern. Furthermore, think about it yourself, if you dropped a combined $100M in three consecutive days, you must have a contingency plan. It is my belief that this multi-hundred millionaire (potentially billionaire), has much deeper pockets than what they leveraged on the options. They'll almost assuredly be using millions more to ensure the success of their $100M+ options play.\n\nI would be remissed if I didn't acknowledge there's a slight possibility this person is just a dumbass Ape like us hitting a ballsdeep YOLO play with his entire Trustfund inheritance. But I doubt it.\n\nIn the event my hypothesis checks out, GME is currently sitting at its new support level. This is bullish and provides a good buying opportunity.\n\n# TL;DR.\n\n**I believe the new baseline price for GME is $124.01.** This is the breakeven price of a huge fucking whale that spent \\~$104M (\\~$116M if exercised) on call options spanning the last three days, March 1st-March 3rd.\n\nWith that in mind **GME closed yesterday at $124.18. JUST 17 CENTS ABOVE THIS BUYER\u2019s BREAKEVEN.**\n\nTo go further, **every time GME dropped below $124 in the AH session, it hit a springboard** back above the closing price and finally finished at $125.00 flat.\n\nIt is my belief that **this multi-hundred millionaire (potentially billionaire), has much deeper pockets** than what they leveraged out on the options. They'll assuredly be using millions more to ensure the success of their $100M+ options play, **which means keeping the price above their $124.01 breakeven.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;","996":"Not clear if I still trust in an honest market for average Joe to invest.   \n\nI'm looking for somewhere to blow some steam. I've been navigating how to invest my hard working savings for over two decades, and because of pandemic, as many other people, I saw myself with my savings going down the drain. So, I tried to educate me in how to operate a trading account, and since then I learn how to take my winning and losses gracefully. (mostly losses) Learn how to look charts and try to find the best moment to get into a position I believe is in a good place for swing or long term investment, and not day trade. However, as we all know, market is bearish, and everything goes with it. But looking into the recent events with GameStop, I got myself wondering. Did the big money guys, that have been clearly manipulating the market forever, leaving the average Joe (like myself) to either give them my money (so they can correctly \"manage\" it for me) or they will take it by creating movements that swap your stop loses positions or zero or cash. \n\nThe reason I'm saying that is because just yesterday, some big money guy releases some intel on a company call XL Fleet, saying he is going short on it because he got some insider giving him intel, which leads him to believe the company is not worth the money. Therefore, creating and extreme down movement, which he capitalize on it, because a lot of people just react to information and don't educate themselves before selling or buying, and hurting people that have a honest plan to invest in an apparent good business model. I understand the risks in investing in a fairly new company, but there is no limit to what these guys can put out there? They can say any crap, and then capitalize in people's overreaction? The GameStop saga did not teach anyone anything? \n\nReally disappointing. Not just losing a substantial amount of money, that eventually will correct, but the unnecessary volatility that these \"professionals\" take profits in people's money. \n\nFeel free to educate me more.","997":"Figuring out this Jigsaw Puzzle that is the Market Hello, Bonjour, Konichua, Privet, Fuck you. <3\n\nYesterday I posted the P\/C ratios for GME.

Where are all the hundreds of thousands of put options???**\n\nMy guess is that Hedgies are putting in these gigantic orders on gme saying its gonna go down  during lunch hours, when there is least activity thus driving the price of gme down even tho its supposed to be gaining retarded 40% gains everyday due to SI...\n\nThese orders all stayed in, the first 10 even 20 minutes of market open..I thought they probably won\u2019t change since I just started to actually use bren, but then I look and its way different...\n\nSome of y\u2019all are gonna hate but Ive been watching RKT alongside since this week.. Funny thing is when RKT went up 40% in one day, GME started dropping, Correlation?\n\nEdit2:   the Short Interest on borrowing shares of RKT was 55% the other day March 3rd, RKT went up 40% or so to a high of like $41 on March 3rd... today it went back down to mid 20s and the borrow rate is still 44%??\n\n Citdadel has short positions in both, they cant win on both sides so they had to sell RKT positions, increasing the price massively since there was a high demand because  \u201c dividend news\u201d  finally hit main stream and a bunch of subs started pumping it, making citadel insane profits on the way up  AND on the way down .. Mind you, the dividend news was from Jan 29 I Believe, so it was all coordinated to make online retards bag holders.... and so apes bought it and some sold for loss, others sold for good gains, but others are just holding because they too now like the stock. It has 44% Borrow Rate and only 300k shares available as of 2PM EST March 4th..\n\nSo they make money on RKT going up and down,  continue short laddering GME to keep the price suppressed. IT all  worked in their favor but RKT doesnt seem to be dropping below $25,or heck it wont even go below $20 because ill buy more LOL! some diamond hands got in and started fucking shit up, like me hehe, 58 shares Wassup baby\n\nMind you beginning of March, and even at its IPO RKT was only at \\~$20.. During their IPO they only put out 1\/3 of their float because there wasn\u2019t a high demand, the news \u201coddly didnt cover or care about their debut\u201d which is the same gay bears  were dealing with, meaning in the future more shares are to be put out but until then cant the price of its shares quadruple if shorts are forced to cover??

Disclaim Not financial advice!\n\nFirst, I am an international student, so my grammar isn't great. Apologize for that first.\n\nI see many people quoting the options volume; Trading volume is the number of shares or contracts traded in a given period. And Open interest is the total number of option contracts that are currently out there. These contracts have been traded but not yet liquidated by an offsetting trade or an exercise or assignment.\n\nIf we are looking for a call chain exercise to cause the gamma squeeze, we should look at the open interest because those are the options not being exercised or offset.\n\nI see a lot of saying that HF can cover their entire short position by buying huge call options to cover their short position and become long-sided.\n\nFirst, if they choose to close their position by call option, it would be more expensive than buying a regular share in the market because you need to pay the premium. They may have some hedge option for their short position, but there would always be more expensive to cover their short position by call option.\n\nEven they choose to do so, it would likely be done when GME falls to the 40 range, which is the cheapest time to buy a call option in the past two weeks. Most of the call options are open last week or this week which is super expensive; consider the IV. ( I think they didn't even think about covering at a loss) .\n\nThen let's take a look at the call option that expires in Mar5. 127232 call options are open, and 31676 call options are in the money. And only the options ITM would be exercised, 31676\\*100=3167600, which only 3 million shares. Let make a minimum assumption that the short position they hold is 60% of the float according to finra, which is 60%\\*45m=27m short position so, if they exercise those call options, which only cover 11.7% of their short position. It would collapse their whole shot position by interest market price by 100,200,300%.\n\nI didn't put the following call options into consideration because there is no point cover their short position multiple times, which could hugely inflate their losses.\n\nSo, call options can't be a good way for them to cover.\n\nPlease correct me if I have any mistakes.\n\nPosition, 104@110\n\nEDIT: Also, they may cover some of their position on the first run-up and short it again when GME falling, but remember that the short borrow interest is as high as over 20%. They lost money for sure, and the interest rate also becomes higher, which makes the second run-up worse for them.   \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nEDIT2: For those who don't know how option pricing, here is the thing, the more call HF purchase, the more iv it is, and the option price shoots up also.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/xxz9n4eh9yk61.png?width=1419&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d59f77026b9bafba00d7098f4aabc8bea6e8665\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/lb2qh7ji9yk61.png?width=1542&format=png&auto=webp&s=73ae785774649bb6b53f6f01b7e359a75b4315f8","1001":"One apes thoughts on everything going down I am curious to know if I am in the minority or majority on some thoughts I have on the ongoing saga of GME vs. everything else. I will TL;DR at the bottom in the order that I present my following points. In case I miss saying it anywhere, the following post is **my opinion.**\n\nFirst full disclosure I have a position in GME and BB (and other non-WSB stocks). With that out of the way lets get started:\n\n1. I am holding GME for the tendies...BUT it has an added bonus **in my opinion** the potential of exposing very questionable trading practices by some parties on the other side. The longer this goes on, the more desperate other parties will get, bigger chance for a slip up (such as the RH buying halt). I also hold for the sweet loss porn of hedge funds affected.\n2. Other stocks that have DD but I do not hold. Yes, I have been down voting them (with the exception of AMC though). No, not because I immediately assume they are shills but rather I personally don't understand the logic of presenting a new stock to YOLO when the DD for GME is so insanely well documented and vetted.\n\n* More on point 2, I understand apes will not necessarily want to YOLO everything on 1 stock and may want to diversify. Again this is only **my opinion,** if that is the case though I would think it more sensible to pick a YOLO\/Meme stock of your own choosing and then throw down in some more \"normal\" stocks. But hey for those that went into multiple YOLO\/Meme stocks, all the power to ya. This is WallStreet**BETS**, not WallStreet**SENSIBLE**.\n\n3. Here are facts, WSB currently has 9.4 million degenerates. The spike in accounts was occurring over the period of time WSB was making media headlines. Media outlets were showing selected WSB posts on mainstream media therefore there are members of the media on WSB (perhaps not with accounts but proven to be digging thru the sub.\n\n* Now for **my opinion**. I believe it is very likely that many of the new WSBers are here to stir shit up. Some of them are detracting from GME and I believe that there are some that are supporting GME. Yes, I think there are big players here who are competitors to the hedge funds that are currently trapped shorting GME. To me this seems like a logical move, especially for a hedge fund that sees an opportunity to gobble up another businesses' clients.\n\nTL;DR **my opinion**\n\n1. Why I hold. GME = Tendies + potential extra bonuses (RH oopsie)\n2. I down vote non-GME DD. Not because bad DD, but because GME DD > \"insert ticker\" DD\n3. WSB = Big community = media attention = bad actors = bad actors **FOR** and **AGAINST** GME\n4. There is no #4, this was a test\n\nAnd that's my two cents.","1002":"The modern day witch-hunt that has become WSB and a plea for the revival of the old WSB. It\u2019s quite obvious that since January there has been a MASSIVE influx of new members to WSB. As an open community, WSB happily welcomes as many new people as we can get but I\u2019m concerned about how that\u2019s changed the dynamic of the subreddit. Before the rise of GME, WSB was a space where everyone was free to discuss various ideas, share DD and gains\/loss porn, and post memes about ANY STOCK they liked or were interested in. Even when popular stocks like Tesla and Palantir came about, they never 100% CONSUMED the discussion diversity of the sub.\n\nNowadays, you come on the sub and literally ALL you see is content related to GME. I personally don\u2019t mind all the GME banter, however, what I do mind is the fact that are tens of thousands of other stocks and opportunities yet many people on the sub act like GameStop is the only company that exists. Too many times have I seen a user on the sub post about some investment idea and get immediately shot down and called out for allegedly being a hedgie or shill trying to lift the focus off GME. \n\nAT THE END OF THE DAY THE GOAL OF INVESTING IS TO MAKE MONEY. WHILE GAMESTOP\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udfff IS A GREAT VEHICLE TO DO THAT, IT IS NOT THE ONLY MEANS OF MAKING MONEY IN THE STOCK MARKET.\n\nWhile I am saying all this, there really isn\u2019t any real way (that I can think of at least) to remedy this issue and this post probably won\u2019t get the publicity and visibility that it needs to make a change. However, I want to make sure my thoughts on the matter are at least out there. Long live diamond hands and power to the player but please remain OPEN MINDED. Allow there to be room on the sub for genuinely great ideas to grow and flourish and receive the attention they deserve. Stay safe y\u2019all.","1003":"Could a market crash be rocket fuel for GME? I\u2019ve been doing a lot of research on GME, mainly through the smooth brained ape posts within \/wsb.  \n\nOne idea that seemed to come up quite a bit was that GME could cause a market crash due to the HF needing to readjusted how they were  leveraged out.  \n\nBut what if a crash happened organically?\n\nIf we are at a market top and see significant pullback, wouldn\u2019t the HF have to readjust their short positions since their long equity would be reduced by the crash?

We really appreciate the hard work you guys are doing. Well, I do anyway.**\n\n*Disclaimer: Feel free to add objective\/rebuking opinions here, I have no hate or disdain for opposite views. I'd welcome some constructive discussion on whether my viewpoint sounds viable or not. I'm in this deep either way.*\n\nSo I've worked in the game industry as a Tech Artist for just over 8 years now, and I connected some dots in January while reading through all the DD about GME.  I've dealt with publishers and capital management firms both in person at GDC and elsewhere, and I am working on my own game project on the side so I am actively dealing with platforms and launching, and I still hold to my guess that **Ryan is aiming at launching an online distribution service to compete with Steam, and potentially overtake it as the strongest digital games distribution platform.**\n\nWhy? Steam doesn't have much competition outside of other publishers who mostly just have a store to front their own games. Gamestop could become an unbiased online platform that also has physical stores where you can buy consoles, PC parts, and trade in used games for credit in said online platform. It's not a gold mine, it's a diamond-encrusted tendie mine waiting to be built. Gamestop has the ability to focus their resources around this strategy, and now is the time to do it.\n\nRyan already has a focus on digital commerce and there is a reason he started following Steam and Epic, and why they are moving more into PC gaming and improving their digital footprint. I can't tell you how long I have felt that Steam is kind of a monopoly in the market, and whoever manages to launch a solid competitor to them is going to be rich beyond their wildest dreams.\n\nSteam makes 30% from the sale of every single game on their platform, and they have a ridiculously small staff running the entire service. It's built to be almost entirely automated, even down to the advertisements running on the store pages. I talked to a bunch of Valve guys at an indy conference a couple years ago and they said the amount of money Steam makes is disgusting considering how little is needed to keep it running, and it needs almost no improvement since it runs well and people like it.\n\nIf they pull it off and become a major competitor to Steam, a 40b, 50b, and even 100b market cap isn't unrealistic in 5 years. Why? If you knew how many games Steam sells on an average basis, you would crap yourself. And as I said, they take a 30% cut across the board. Do you know how much 30% of every game sold on Steam is? I'll give you a hint: it's a lot. Steam has essentially been printing money for years with no real competition. Epic Games is still getting started and is popular with only a few of their titles so far, they are expanding but their focus is divided between the store, Fortnite, publishing, and of course their Engine, which I use regularly and love. Gamestop in this space would be 100% focused on their store and ecommerce. That is a big deal.\n\nA 100b market cap would value GME at $1431 per share if compared to today's 124 @ 8.66b, at regular market valuation. That's not the squeeze number. Even 40b on a conservative estimate puts it at $572\/share.\n\nI'm not a trade aficionado so my calculations about the valuations may not be spot on since my specialty is in my industry and not finance. I'm open to more business\/finance wrinkle-brains to give me more accurate numbers for those market caps. But Steam has been without any real competition for over a decade now, and Gamestop has the capital, infrastructure, and now the leadership to make this happen.\n\nI'm looking forward to the squeeze as much as the rest of you but to be 100% honest, this is going to go Nuclear if I am right, and not as a temporary squeeze. I could be wrong, but in my mind it would be stupid of them not to do it, they have all the pieces ready, and Ryan is the puzzlemaster.\n\nLet's fucking go.\n\n***TLDR: Gamestop may be positioning themselves to become a major competitor in the digital game distribution market alongside and potentially even surpassing Steam, Epic, and GoG.***\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n**Edit:** 230 @ 125. I'm going to be adding to my position as often as I can because if I am right ***this is going to make 150\/share during a squeeze seem like peanuts***. What's past alpha centuri?\n\n**Edit 2:** Loving the discussion this is provoking. As much as I love the memes, it's good to bring up the signs that GME's future outlook makes them extremely undervalued even without the squeeze, but goddamn I am lookin forward to tendies either way \ud83d\ude80.","1005":"GME and Citadel - Why the consolidation?

He did hours and hours of due diligence and saw ample growth potential for the struggling retail store. When people compared Gamestop to Blockbuster, he laughed.\n\nSince Gamestop skyrocketed and drew international attention, he has been under a microscope. Billions of dollars see him as the leader, and eagerly await for any slip up that they can pin him with market manipulation for. Everybody knows that his actions were perfectly legal, but the information he puts out is now severely restricted for the aforementioned reasons.

That being said, you degenerates amaze and disappoint me every day so here we go again.\n\nRyan Cohen founded Chewy in 2011 and served as the CEO until 2018 when he sold the company for over $3B. This marked the largest-ever acquisition of an e-commerce company and speaks to RC's expertise in e-commerce. This man is the messiah.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn 11\/16\/20, Cohen formally wrote a letter to the Gamestop board of directions, detailing his concerns with the company as well as the potential that he saw in it. Within it, he discussed:\n\n\\- The growth and potential that the gaming industry has to offer\n\n\\- The large customer base with over 55 million members registered to their rewards program\n\n\\- Gamestop's unwillingness to change with the times\n\n\\- Gamestop's hardships amid the 'gaming boom'\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHis letter made it clear that he has a vision for what Gamestop could be, and that he has a plan to get it there. He recently upped his stake from 9-12.91% on 1\/12\/21, which was immediately followed by a rise in the stock price as investors embraced the potential turnaround. If we have any chance of making it to valhalla, Ryan Cohen will lead us.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Draining the swamp**\n\nAs Cohen expressed in his letter, one of the main reasons for Gamestop's fall was its lack of competent leadership. The ship has been sinking for years, and its crew has been suspiciously negligent.

Also, this is probably obvious to you seasoned artists (it is to me after Fidelity explained this all to me on the phone), but smooth-brained apes like myself might not understand this, or even panic at waking up to any margin call for $25000 (note - if you don't meet this you're not on the hook for it - you just get restrictions placed on your account for some time). Or maybe you read the many topics on day trading available on the internet and came to the same (wrong) conclusion as me.\n\nPattern day traders have different margin requirements than interday or non-pattern day traders. A pattern day trader is classified as someone who \"day trades 4 or more times in a 5 day period\", and a day trade is classified as \"the opening and closing of securities on the same day\". What sites don't explain better is that this is based on the *number of open positions, not the number of times you sell*.\n\nFor example, Fidelity explains [day trading on margin](https:\/\/www.fidelity.com\/learning-center\/trading-investing\/trading\/day-trading-margin), and their following example of a day trade:\n\n- A purchase of 250 shares of ABC stock at 10 a.m., followed by a purchase of another 250 ABC shares at 11 a.m., followed by a sale of 500 ABC shares at 3 p.m.\n\nwhen read in the context of the page I linked to seems to imply that this would count as a single day trade. This is not the case. Over the course of yesterday I bought 92 shares of RKT over 6 orders, and I sold 70 of them near market close. This morning I woke up to a text saying I am subject to a day trade minimum equity call, and I now need to maintain equity of $25,000 or more to trade on margin.\n\nI'm not going to meet this (I have no interest in tying up $25,000 for pattern day trading), so in 5 days my account will be restricted to cash buying only for 90 days (though I can't trade on margin for the next 5 days anyways so it's basically 95 days), and I need to avoid day trading at all in that account or else the counter may reset. After 60 days of no day trades in the account, you revert to non-pattern day trade status, but for missing the minimum equity call you still can't trade on margin for 30 days after that.\n\nI have a cash account I usually day trade out of, but I impulse closed all of my other positions (besides GME) and YOLO'd into RKT. I profited nicely of of yesterday but this was the result of my greed. I at least have a decent amount of cash to invest after yesterday (and I did buy 5 more GME shares today, still holding 27 RKT positions), but I would not have bought 92 shares over several orders had I understood this would result in 5 day trades for the separate positions I had opened, not just one trade for the single sell order.\n\nLast thing I want to mention: don't trade on margin unless you know the risks. And if you are unsure of anything, you can always call your broker. And if you can't, stop trading on CashApp or RobinHood and get a real broker you absolute mong.\n\nAs for me... well I just bought 5 more shares of GME this morning with cash so maybe y'all can help me meet that minimum equity call :D (just kidding, this is not investment advice).

To clarify that was when the price was low single digits and I'd still have made 35x. I've been lurking for a while, MSFT 200 wasn't a winner, nor all those SPY puts. But GME is legit.  \n\nI didn't get into GME in Jan, but I did buy in Feb. This stock isn't about intrinsic value, it's about the short squeeze. Every analyst has it as a short term buy, they see it happening too. \n\nI am notoriously paper handed, but I can't see myself selling anything below $420.69 a share here. We are going to hit it. I might have my expectations short of the moon, but it doesn't take a genius to see this stock as a buy and hold right now.","1016":"Please Help Me Calculate Fair GME Price (post-squeeze) I would like to form my own conclusion as to what GME stock price should realistically settle at, after all the dust settles.\n\nI'm calculating the expected market cap of a company (like Gamestop), post-pivot.\n\nPlease let me know if I make any mistakes in calculating, that is why I am posting this, for feedback.\n\n# Here is my work so far...\n\nThe expected size of the gaming industry toward the end of 2021: $**200B**\n\nIF GameStop manages to capture just 1-2% of **this** market, that's **$2** to **$4B earnings.

This is the stock market, not the GME market. GME is not the only stock that exist. We all have the same sentiment that apes together strong and we will hold GME. With that being said, NOT FUCKING EVERYTHING IS A PLOY BY HEDGE FUNDS TO GET YOU OUT OF GME. This rocket squeeze was created by CEO, the CEO of rocket has done amazing things with the company, and their balance sheet is impressive. He hates shorts as much as we do, so he decided to do something about it by essentially creating a gamma squeeze. Rocket was a really good play, especially with options. We don't need to discredit good plays just because they are not Gamestop.\n\nEdit: Thank you guys for all the awards","1019":"I love this community... but we need to talk. I've been a longtime lurker in this sub, even before I grew a pair and started dipping my toes into the market.  The variety of people, the thoroughness of their research, and the veracity with which they defend it, make this place what it is.  \n\nI only began trading as a side hustle at the start of the pandemic (with modest success).  My biggest wins came from WSB.  When the real push on GME started, I was there.  I was a bag holder of GME after January, but my bag wasn't too large  and I liked the stock, so I grew some diamond hands and held.  I started really following the day-to-day threads, reading every piece of financial news I could, watched Bruce eat his bagels, and developed a much deeper understanding of the market in general.  \n\nI don't listen to all the advice I see on here... and I don't blindly trust DD.  \n\nWhy I feel I need to post today:  \nThe mood in this sub has changed drastically over the last 24 hours.  The rift I see between the GME folks and the RKT folks saddens me greatly.  I don't know exactly how I fee about RKT... something just seems too contrived about it.\n\nI've seen some DD that suggests it's a HF ploy to pull people out of GME.  If that's the case, I don't think it will be successful.  GME apes are strong.  You don't just lose your diamond hands on a whim.\n\nI've seen other DD that suggests it's a HF hedge and their using this to boost their capital in order to better defend their position in GME\/AMC.  This seems a bit more plausible to me, but I'm  still not 100% convinced.  A lot of people are posting massive gains (sincere congratulations). \n\nWhat conclusion I have come to is this.  If I were a HF or a MM who needed WSB to fracture, I would seed disunity and distrust among the community.  I would send every bot or shill I could in every direction.  Some strongly defending RKT, some tearing it down.  Some screaming GME is dead, while others quietly suggest taking gains from RKT and rolling them into UWMC.  I wouldn't suggest a shit stock that I knew nobody would listen about... I would use my best DD and find something that could tear attention away from GME and tear the community apart.  And unfortunately, I think it's starting to work.  Just reading the daily discussion thread for today is like watching two 3-year-olds argue about what superhero would win in a fight.  \n\nI love this community.  I hope that some of you may read this and that it may make a small difference.  When it comes to money, it's easy to manipulate peoples feelings.  I just hope that in the end, Apes Together Strong is the sentiment.\n\nGood luck today everyone, and thank you.","1020":"Choosing between $GME & $AMC, Let's gooooooooo $AMC to the fucking moon! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 Listen Swamp Fox here, I found this chicken coup that's not guarded by any dogs. Coast is clear for now, you better eat as much chickens and eggs as possible. Cuz the dogs and bears are coming for our gains and chickens. $AMC is safe to go to the moon for a few days but will taper off next week. Saddle the fuck up, stay the fuck away from $GME unless you have balls of steel and trying to catch an aneurysm. But if you time it well, you might drive a new car. But I can't assure you. I will say, today's pop of $GME was a change of CFO in the company, showing they are serious about their management. So, it might be a legit company but the sugar rush can get you killed.\nI'm not too greedy, so Imma stick with the smaller chicken, $AMC does have a solid balance sheet and very low debt. Soon to be acquired. I think there may be three pops.\n\n\n1. Riding the $GME meme stock wave, but tapers cuz Wallstreet gonna bitch a little and Robinhood might do their fuckery. \n\n2. The second pop gonna piggyback on the news for opening 13 theaters in the east coast in March. I think it might taper off due to mix reactions of the theaters opening.\n\n3. The third one I think it's gonna be related to being acquired cuz I think the players will see the potential in $AMC to integrate it into their existing streaming service.\n\n If I were in the mind of any company let's say Amazon or Netflix who are currently in talks on acquiring the mega cinema movie chain.\n \nThis would be the perfect opportunity to recoup lost revenue from 2020 COVID pandemic shutdown,bit will bolster their revenue by expanding the existing A-Lister program from $AMC to either companies existing streaming service subscriptions. And I would provide discount deals to like 20% off to combine the streaming service and enjoying the new ticket movie reservation experience at the theaters.\n\nSomewhat similar to what HBO max is doing, but there's a possibility that the streaming service titans will now have a new jar that they can stick they hands in, the movies theater and distribution industry. Because if they own the movies, they now can receive their cut from movie distribution like Disney who hold their properties close to the chest to play their movies on the newly owned theaters. Some movies that either streaming service owns rights to, they'll have the more affordable plans without the theater plan if that customer isn't comfortable to go to the theaters or even prefer the comfort of their home. How ever it goes, it's going to be a solid win for either Amazon or Netflix.\n\nThat's just an opinion and an idea of mine. I'm not a financial advisor, please do your own research. I'm just a Fox who loves fucking shit up in the Swamp and help other to eat some too if they're silly as I am.\nPosted 2\/26 on social media.","1021":"GME Short interest going down High Short Interest Stocks TOP 5\n\n1.GME GameStop Corp.

I have been seeing alot of great DD on PLTR in the sub and others. Other DD suggests that the market cap is way too high for the revenue they are generating. I believe that fundamentals are not the biggest factor anymore, now that all of us got our stim checks, and are yoloing money at shares that never had great fundamentals. True, PLTR may be overvalued, but name a silicon valley company that is not? Furthermore, PLTR is a company that actually has value.  \n\n\nThe play:\n\nRight now the options are going for cheap. The share price has sunk down, after GME gang started loosing money and wsb went quiet.

I can agree with most people that RKT may have been under valued due to the recent dividend ; but **is RKT the next GME stock? In my opinion NO.** The key difference to GME is the short position. Chairmen Daniel Gilbert alone at RKT owns [1.9 billion shares](https:\/\/media.discordapp.net\/attachments\/743306605445251126\/816453893160173568\/unknown.png) ( [1.9billion 2nd link)](https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/market-activity\/stocks\/rkt\/insider-activity) while the total available shares is only [115 million](https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/market-activity\/stocks\/rkt\/institutional-holdings). If you have been following any of the GME DD **the short position on RKT is no where near GME short shorts  (Please some one prove me wrong).**\n\nThe only concern I see with RKT is the [option chain](https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/quote\/RKT\/options?p=RKT) for this week and next week ; it's all closing in the money. What does this mean? I'm not sure exactly. But looking at the chain for march 5th I can tell you Puts are currently short roughly -119 million dollars. So every dollar past $34 is just a win for anyone holding common stock. I'm really just interested what other people have to say about entire option chains expire in the money. Any one see this before?\n\nWe are all apes we can eat different bananas; I'm just want to debate bananas\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 1: Shorted Shares DD\n\nAs of 3\/2\/20 The market cap for RKT currently sits at [82.55 billion](https:\/\/www.google.com\/finance\/quote\/RKT:NYSE?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwis0vHo-ZLvAhWUVc0KHcenDr4Q3ecFMAB6BAgQEBo&window=MAX) which is roughly 1,984,375,000 shares at 41.60. Chairmen [Daniel Gilbert](https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?ei=WOs-YLvyC5SDtQacgpPoCg&q=dan+gilbert+net+worth&oq=dan+gilbert&gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAEYADIKCAAQsQMQsAMQQzIHCC4QsAMQQzIHCC4QsAMQQzIHCAAQsAMQQzIHCC4QsAMQQzIHCAAQsAMQQzIHCC4QsAMQQzIHCAAQsAMQQzIHCAAQsAMQQzIHCAAQsAMQQ1AAWABg3xRoAXAAeACAAXuIAXuSAQMwLjGYAQCqAQdnd3Mtd2l6yAEKwAEB&sclient=gws-wiz) alone owns 1,867,177,661 shares leaving 117,197,339 shares available trade.

WallStreetBets is about making money, doesn't matter what play. And yes, there will be some bagholders on that one. But everyone playing it knows the risk. There's only two appropriate responses if someone tells you they bought into $RKT. 1)If they lose money, you troll them and call them a retard. 2)They make money, and you congratulate them and tell them to fuck themselves.\n\nNow, none of you are wrong to be skeptical about the play. It does in fact seem too easy, doesn't it? Well, as noted in the below post, at LEAST two of the hedge funds we're fighting on the GME front are in on the $RKT play:\n\n[https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/lw0g1g\/the\\_industry\\_players\\_again\\_gme\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/lw0g1g\/the_industry_players_again_gme\/)\n\n(Credit to u\/Dadri88 and u\/skifunkster)\n\nBut what if I told you it didn't matter that they were profiting off that play? I'm serious, it doesn't matter. Even if they personally asked the Board of Rocket to declare the special dividend, and planned to mobilize WSB in pursuit of profit (They didn't do this), we should still be lining up to kiss them. They're hanging themselves in front of our eyes. Here's why:\n\n$GME needs a catalyst. We've known this is still a legitimate play, but most posts are in agreement. We needs whales, we need hedge funds on our side, and we need catalysts. We now have SEVERAL catalysts. In case you've forgotten, the catalysts for GME occuring this month are: Earnings, The Quadruple Witching Day, and now $RKT.\n\nWhy is $RKT a catalyst for GME? We're not quite at the finish line yet. How will we know when we're close? They'll pull out our controllers again (Limiting Buying). How do they wind up defeated if they do this? Big money on our side. $RKT will get us that money. If you're still too retarded to picture it, let me provide an example.\n\nImagine you're Papa Elon. You want to shoot your SpaceX Rockets to the Moon and beyond. So far, you've loaded the ships with apes and bananas, but you need some ACTUAL astronauts on board. How do you earn the trust of the real astronauts (AKA BIG MONEY)? You launch a test flight. $RKT is the SpaceX test flight, retards. It doesn't matter if you like the play, if you're in on the action, or not. You SHOULD be cheering it on.\n\nIf it works, we have proof of concept. Imagine it: A Massive short squeeze on a company where the short interest is only 30-40%. What do you think will prove our point that squeezes can be squoze, better than seeing a real live squeeze in public view? It's literally the best thing that could happen.\n\nSo, moral of the story: Sit back, shut the fuck up, and cheer those other retards on! If that play works, it will help send our own to the goddamn moon! Smile apes, and I'll see you on the Moon!\n\nEdit: This is of course, not financial advice. I am a dumb ape, who picks his nose and eats it. I just like the stonks.

Jay Farner, the CEO is going live with Morgan Stanley during a TECH conference to have a fireside chat.\n\nYou're going to tell me that they just happened to have this scheduled smack in the middle of the week of hell for RKT shorts? You're going to tell me that there's no way they might drop a bomb that truly sends RKT to the stratosphere?\n\nI have no fucking idea. But I trust in Dan Gilbert & Co. to win. Because that's all they've done for the past 35 fucking years. WIN.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo make things even sweeter, more dry powder is coming in tomorrow- market makers making new options tomorrow. Remember the first time new options came out for GME? If you bought even the farthest OTM one, it printed.\n\n\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8MM WILL HAVE TO REMAIN DELTA NETURAL WITH THEIR NEW OPTIONS \ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8, THUS THEY WILL HAVE TO BUY SHARES. THEREFORE, THE MORE NEW OPTIONS BOUGHT TOMORROW, THE MORE FUEL IS LOADED FOR A GAMMA SQUEEZE. \ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo close things up, recall that RKT had 40% interest going into this week. Look at today's graph.\n\n[https:\/\/imgur.com\/vIgVH7l](https:\/\/imgur.com\/vIgVH7l)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNotice those two drops where it halted? See the STRONG support that immediately followed? This is a textbook example of a ladder attack. The SHORTS HAVE RELOADED, AT A NEW PRICE. Shorts ATTEMPTED to shake the \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50 , but failed. Retail is NOT ALONE on this \ud83d\ude80. The DIP is being purchased, even while at an ATH.  Someone is on the LONG side buying up shares with retail.\n\nIn my opinion, after today, short interest could potentially even end up way higher than 40%. Look at the candles during those short ladder attacks. Shorts had to have borrow MILLIONS of shares to attempt to short ladder today. I wouldn't be surprised if this is Melvin & CO's latest play to dig themselves out of their Gamestop loss porn either.\n\nMORE SHORTING = MORE SHORTS TO CHOKE\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo that's reason 1. There's a nonzero chance Jay Farner drops a bomb tomorrow that takes us to the stratosphere. But what's reason 2?\n\n\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8MY PRICE TARGET FOR RKT IS $73.5 \ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\n\nLet's go through the numbers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRKT's projected EPS for this year is \\~ $2.45.\n\n\\[LINK 3\\] \\~ (SOURCE IS ON SA, REMOVED LINK BECAUSE IT WAS GETTING MY POST DELETED)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo get P\/E, take the price and divide by earnings. Thus, we can use this to calculate the forward P\/E for RKT. RKT closed at $41.79, which divided by $2.45 is \\~17.05. Thus, RKT currently trades at about a 17Forward P\/E. Companies in this sector trade in between 15-30 P\/E, and since I strongly believe RKT is a growth stock, I think it should trade at 30x P\/E.\n\nThus, 30 x $2.45 is $73.5.\n\nTherefore, my PT for RKT is $73.5. RKT is a fintech company, and is a PROFITABLE one. Think about how many fintech companies have crazier valuations and aren't even profitable?\n\nYou know what that means?\n\nIT'S NOT FUCKING OVER. IF SUITS ARE BUYING AT ATH, IM BUYING AT ATH. IF SHORTS HAVE RELOADED, THE SQUEEZE HAS NOT SQUOZE. THE SUITS AGREE. RKT IS WORTH MORE THAN $40.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: SHORT INTEREST HAS PROBABLY GONE UP, SUITS ARE BUYING. CURRENT P\/E is 17, GROWTH PE IN MY OPINION SHOULD BE AT LEAST 30. RKT IS STILL UNDERVALUED, AND MY PRICE TARGET IS $73.5\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRemember, \ud83d\ude80 fundamentally a great company. They are still NOT priced as a growth stock. They are still NOT considered Fintech by the suits. There is a reason why this stock closed strong at a new ATH.\n\nI LIKE THE STOCK.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8My PT is $73.5. \ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\n\n\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea850 TOMORROW \ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\n\n\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea860 to 70+ EOW if the shorts bail instead of of doubling down.\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\n\nTHIS IS NOT A \ud83e\uddfb\ud83d\udc50TRADE\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot financial advice.

This is simple math: There are 1.7 billion more shares of RKT than there are of GME. It is mathematically impossible for it to squeeze like GME will.

Me personally, I think a squeeze is happening as we speak and so maybe it\u2019s worth investing in, maybe not.\n\nI personally do not have a position in RKT and I won\u2019t go into it because I have my cash invested into GME (as well as my other blue chips). I\u2019m still -45% (it was -82% but I continued to average down) but I very strongly believe that we are gonna see this squeeze come into play some time around 15th March - 19th March. This would be due to: the second GME hearing 17th leading to an increase in media attention, Quadruple Witching day (extreme volume trading) 19th, with GME Q4 reports coming around the 25th. If the squeeze is to happen, mostly likely it will happen around mid to end March. \n\nNow back to RKT, i think that with this volatility that I personally wouldn\u2019t sell my GME shares to free up capital to invest into RKT, why would I lock in losses and then further risk being a bag holder for the RKT squeeze because the moment to invest in would\u2019ve been 2 days ago before we saw the jump and chances are that the squeeze will be finished very soon. If you are going to invest into RKT then I suggest you deposit more cash into you account and use that instead. \n\nAt the end, it\u2019s your choice. I know we all love GME and AMC but we can\u2019t fool ourselves by calling RKT a shill. My only advice I wish you do take from this is to never get too emotional and never let seeing a stock rally make you feel greedy that you think you\u2019ll get lucky and ride that squeeze. There\u2019s no telling when it will end. But when it does it\u2019ll crash back to earth. On the other hand, GME is a squeeze entirely of its own class. One that we cannot comprehend just yet. If the squeeze happens, which I believe it will. It will be historic. One that will be on movies and taught in economics classes for the future generations.\n\nOf course you do not have to listen to me. I don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m saying. But, if we all keep holding our GME shares, then we will inevitably squeeze the greatest of all squeezes. HODL (and GL to all you RKT squeezers I guess, I hope you put some of that profit  into GME or put your losses back into GME and be ready for what I call the \u201cRocket Gamma Short Squeeze\u201d \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nEdit: I do feel very conflicted with this post I made, and I might take it down. Is it a way to directly distract us (I.e, their manipulating RKT stock upwards)?  No. but are they indirectly manipulating the stock (I.e, through all of the media coverage and bots sharing gains on WSB and stuff)? I very much think this can be the case. If you ever see an increase in posts where people are praising RKT and shaming GME then that\u2019s blatant manipulation... \nBut I just cannot stand seeing my fellow apes acting like GME cultists, we mustn\u2019t get too emotional and think everything has got to do with GME. I own some TILRAY stocks long term, and I also hold CCIV stocks long term and continue to dollar cost average down into profits. But when it comes to short term, I\u2019m solely focused on GME and AMC and I own far more GME than any other stock currently because I really believe in this movement, plus my brain would malfunction if I has to look at more than two shares at once\ud83d\ude05","1040":"DFV Monologue on GME Look at them, they come to short GME when they know they are not pure.

I have been following the **GME, AMC** short squeeze, gamma squeeze closely and creating spreadsheets, collating data and performing more google searches per min than the average ape and I am really excited to reveal my conclusions of the technical analysis to you all.\n\nBy adding up the number of posts and comments on this sub reddit, of people who claim to be holding shares and having diamond hands, combined with the confirmation bias of all the people making side bets of what they will do when the price hits certain technical levels, we have very clear markers for reading the next moves the market will make and how to best capitalise on them.\n\nKey reference data used in my spreadsheets (but not the only post, honest!!) https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/ls3n78\/people_who_get_permabanned_if_they_dont_do\/\n\nFirst off as soon as GME breaks the **$500** mark there will be a huge rush on the market for people needing to fill their orders for tattoos they had promised at this benchmark. This is a HUGE new demand for tattoos that if Robinhood could not predict the demand for GME how can the tattoo artists predict the demand for tattoo ink? Here we have all the market makings for a first bull run on the **tattoo industry**, so invest heavily in them!!! \n\nUnfortunately the wise apes amongst you will already know (and I found out after one google search) there has not been an IPO for a tattoo studio so there is not a direct stock you can invest in.... Booooooo..... however all hope is NOT lost. We see clear evidence of past WSB users who fat fingering buying GMED when trying to buy GME, so the actual stock is NOT necessarily important.  The rush of Apes who will invest in the ticker **$INKAU** will be significantly high as they will likely think it is the Australian supplier of tattoo ink. \n\nNext marker to look for is the **$1000** price break.... should GME go above this we see another flood in the tattoo industry, but also we see divergence into the \"inserting things in places the sun does not shine\"... hence the next top tip ticker to watch for bull run at $1000 are the **Lubricants and Grease** manufacturing tickers **$KAI** Kadant Inc is my pick here. \n\nBy **$5000** a share things start to get a little hard to model as soo much cash will be flowing back into the retailers hands at this point, the call options to fill of: The drinking of the own users piss is outweighed by the pure tendies spilling out of fellow apes pockets from the stonk being close to the moon. Hence I theorise that a movement will have formed off the internet that will drive up the demand for... **$TSLA, $KFC and $WENDY** as it will become \"the fashion\" to drive around in a Tesla while eating a family size bucked of KFC tendies in a Wendys parking lot.\n\nBeyond that I can not model accurately enough to share anything worthwhile, but there is one AI program that has spat out an interesting result possibility now on two separate test runs that I want you to just hold as food for thought.\n\nWhen a simulation was run at a price mark of **$42069.00 and $69420.00** per share the **Festo Octopusgripper AI robot** indicated that there was going to be a huge run on Gourds. That is right the vegetable gourd as a commodity will become very popular and the simulation recommends investing in **gourd futures**.\n\nUPDATE: Fresh off the ticker tape with a 83.7% probability if the price hits **$100,000** per share then the retail investors will pool all their tendies and buy the **actual moon** and have diamond hands tattooed on the surface to be visible from earth!\n\nNeedless to say there is not a wrinkle in my brain left so I'm gonna jump the gun and open my long positions now, I am not a financial advisor but do with this information what you will.\n\nSpace Ape out\n\nTLDR: \n\n* $500 - Tattoo Ink from Australia $INKAU\n* $1000 - Lubricants and Grease $KAI\n* $5000 - Tesla, tendies in Wendys parking lot\n* $42069 and $69420 - Future Gourds\n* $100,000 - WSB will buy the actual moon\n\nEDIT: Fresh data in....

Hi fellow retards!\n\nMy hypothesis and granted this may have already been postulated here is that the hedgers had enough liquidity in Jan to short GME and temper the price back down. Now it appears that they\u2019ve run out of liquidity and are forced to sell their income generating securities to continue to short in an act of desperation. \n\nAs a parallel - consider it from a mortgage perspective they\u2019re trying to stave of foreclosure by first burning through savings and now they\u2019re selling off their valuable possessions. So they can\u2019t borrow off margin, they are out of cash and now they\u2019re selling off their source of income. Which by the way hurts the passive investors that like their ETF stocks, but the hedges don\u2019t give a shit. They just want to short GME no matter the cost. \n\nThe mortgage allegory reminds me of say the 2008 crisis - I used to be a loan officer and the exotic sub prime mortgages were horse shit. You could qualify for a mortgage back then with a DTI (debt to income ratio) of 65%. For those unaware DTI is the ratio of your GROSS income vs the PITI of your home and all revolving and installment debt on your credit report. It does not factor in payments for utilities, food, gas. So they assume people can afford a house with the 35% of gross fucking income after their monthly debt is paid? No. Now the opposite is happening again. They deserve this for their insatiable greed and lack of compassion for anyone but themselves. \n\nHedgies have no cash and selling their income generating stocks to continue this fight. Eventually they\u2019ll run out of those and will have no choice but to cover no matter the price. They fucking deserve it. From their ashes I hope we can build a market that is free and open without their influence and heavy shorting a float will be illegal. If I want to pay x dollars for a stock, that\u2019s my business. Shorting is bullshit. Think a company is overvalued? Then close your position and find another fucking stock. The government should be appalled. Trying to BK a company not only puts thousands out of a job, but reduces the income tax stream from them to the gov\u2019t. Not only that but now they\u2019re on the govt payroll via unemployment. All this so they can profit off of destruction. Fuck. You. Long post I\u2019m sorry.\n\nTLDR: hedgies are going to burn for their atrocities. \n\nMy position: 914 shares of GME and one 3\/5 $100 call. The shares I\u2019d be willing to part with for say a minimum of 4 figures per share. Maybe 5 who knows? 42,069 per share has a nice ring to it. I like the stock and this isn\u2019t financial advice. Hedge funds are cucks.","1051":"Why Melvin and the other HF\u2019s basically have no chance of winning...IMO! There is only one answer as to how on Earth 140% shorting was allowed. This is due to the concept of naked shorting...\n\nthis in simple terms is when shorters (like big institutions like Melvin) decide to short the stocks without locating the stock holders (basically meaning they are shorting without caring about if their shorts match the supply of holders) and this lead to 140% shorting which lead to phantom shares. This is all highly illegal except for one exception (to the best of my belief (youtube it and read up on the SEC to confirm otherwise don\u2019t believe me)... an exception to which the government will turn the check is when naked short selling a company that results in bankrupt by which they end up making big amounts of profit.\n\nWhy does this even matter? It\u2019s because through these phantom shares, they are able to manipulate the \u2018failure to deliver\u2019 system in the stock market and so through manipulating these failure to delivers they trick the algorithm into having to adjust a sell off - they do this to trick us and to make us actually fear and cause a real sell off - they belief this hype is temporary that will pass, they do not realise that we are not cats that are not playing around no more... \n\nThink about it, no honestly think about it...everyone was gunning for $1,000 the way in which we are all diamond handing this hold then why would a natural sell off occur only half way? It\u2019s because of market manipulation caused by the restrictions of being able to buy shares, the news media penetrating that the interest in GME was over and these Failure to deliver and ladder attacks. The Majority of us are still holding, holding through -80% and didn\u2019t sell when it went down why? Well it\u2019s simple. ITS BECAUSE THE SQUEEZE HAS NOT BEEN SQUOZE. \n\nNow back to naked short selling, this is market manipulation at its finest BUT, of course GameStop is no longer dead. Through the great help of Ryhan Cohen\u2019s and WSB the giant has been revived once more meaning that there is inevitable death for the HF\u2019s as long as we manage to hold. Shorting requires for interests to have to be paid in order to keep the position open. Which means that if we hold on long enough we will absorb Melvin dry. The more hype there is the more these interests go up. And that\u2019s our key to pulling off a wicked gamma squeeze like nothing seen before us...it\u2019s a great time to be alive!\n\nAnd although it may appear on screen that short interest is back under the 100% mark. I think that the final 40% of shorts won\u2019t be able to be deductible since it\u2019s made up of phantom shares. Melvins and all the other hedgefunds only way to succeed was for them to pull this short off in the shadows without anyone realising. This stock has been shorted for years! But that plan has now epically failed so now they know they have no choice but to use any dirty tactics they can to divide and conquer through any and every manipulation tactics that exist. it\u2019s corruption vs the people.

I went into a GameStop with my girlfriend so she could buy her normal little Pokemon Knick knacks and t-shirts.... BUT.... My visit made me rethink that GameStop really is doing better than I thought.\n\nFirst of all, this location had about 15 customers in there not including us. Two people bought switches, and three bought memberships before it got to our turn in line.\n\nBut seriously, I'm here to talk about the membership and how I could see it was causing serious loyalty. I haven't paid attention to their membership in a while, so I was surprised to see that about 10 of the 15 people that were checked out before me said they wanted to use their membership coupon, or wanted to sign up for the membership.\n\nWhen it came to be my turn in line, I had to ask. What's the membership do.\n\nIt's 15 a year, and you get a 5 dollar discount coupon every month, including one that you could use right away that printed on the receipt. I shit you not, that all three people before me, and then me, went a took that instant 5 dollar coupon to go buy something else right away, leading me to actually spend $20 more than I intended on during my visit.\n\nI felt like I was getting a deal, but I also worked retail for years and know they probably more than made that 5 dollars back.\n\nBut the thing that makes me the most hopeful, was the amount of customers that told the cashier they would see them next month.\n\nGranted, I live in a decently large city... But it really made it seem like they were not only keeping busy, but their membership program change is working.\n\nI commented to the guy I thought the membership was only for games, and he said thankfully they had changed it for pretty much all the products in the store - realistically why I actually stop in the too look around even if I have games, to get my nerdy stuff.\n\nTLDR: felt like the new membership program was \ud83d\udd25, bought more than I expected, and saw what looked like a lot of customer loyalty.\n\nEdit:: Spelling from mobile, and to mention I do not currently have any shares as stated in one of the top comments.

Enjoy this *light* weekend reading \ud83d\ude09\n\n\\------------\n\n**Part 1: FINRA**\n\nI put together the FINRA daily short data for the last week and you can see an increase in short volume over the last 6 days! [http:\/\/regsho.FINRA.org\/regsho-Index.html](http:\/\/regsho.finra.org\/regsho-Index.html) (@CultureCrypto sent me this link that had the data in a much more friendly fashion [https:\/\/www.FINRA.org\/FINRA-data\/short-sale-volume-daily](https:\/\/www.finra.org\/finra-data\/short-sale-volume-daily))\n\n(Note: if you want to find this raw data, use the link above and you will need to go into each day's file (updated at 6pm daily) and search for GME, then copy the raw numbers. the top of the document will show you what each number corresponds to - this is not a user-friendly document)\n\nThere was an additional **22 million** in short volume today, on top of the **33m yesterday and 12m Wednesday**. While this is a decrease in absolute shorts from yesterday, volume also decreased proportionally so it is still identical short volume to total volume ratio.\n\nThe short volume as % of total daily volume, as published by FINRA, is at **57**% which is the same levels that we saw on Jan 27-29 when there was a concerted effort to bring down the share price.\n\n**CAVEATS:**\n\n* This data does not include NYSE, which is why total volume for today is 38M but actual total vol is 90 million. Thanks to u\/tri_fire_engineer for bringing this up. He has posted the full data for yesterday down in the comments and it actually showed that **once NYSE data was included, Short Volume % went up from 56.8% to 57.6%. I think this shows that while the FINRA data is just a sample, its large enough to be considered representative of the full marke**t\n* **daily data does NOT equate to % of total shares that are shorted,** as the same share could be shorted multiple time and there are other thing that lenders do which could be considered 'shorting' but is not what we would usually define. The best data is the monthly FINRA data but that only comes out once a month and that doesn't sound very fun.\n\nHere are my data tables, again all taken from the FINRA daily data.\n\n**Assumptions used:**\n\nGME Float Stock: 54,490,000 (this is more pessimistic than some reports of only 45M)\n\nGME Total Shares: 69,750,000\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/2lpie1wm12k61.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=450f545a8b2e00b3876d9efc406fba5032fa8a74\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/3jkeam6o12k61.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=a31ac92005edf92bc4ff3180840c376322d3f571\n\nThe FINRA site also now lists GME short % of float at **60.35%** ( [http:\/\/finra-markets.morningstar.com\/MarketData\/EquityOptions\/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&sdkVersion=2.58.0](http:\/\/finra-markets.morningstar.com\/MarketData\/EquityOptions\/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&sdkVersion=2.58.0) ) Thanks to u\/wrek for sending this!\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/jvvu6wat12k61.png?width=449&format=png&auto=webp&s=75eb1ee3899e6bead49611fd2fb68ad380ba4030\n\n\\----------\n\n**Part 2: Borrowing Shares**\n\nTwo other things to note are the decrease in available shorted shares and the increase in fees associated with shorting GME.\n\nThe data available through iborrowdesk.com ([https:\/\/iborrowdesk.com\/report\/GME](https:\/\/iborrowdesk.com\/report\/GME) ). For those wondering about the site, check out the about page; the site uses text files from Interactive Broker\u2019s FTP site ([https:\/\/iborrowdesk.com\/about](https:\/\/iborrowdesk.com\/about) ).\n\nNote: This data does not take into account all available shorts since it is just looking at Interactive Broker, but is a good gauge for how easy it is to get shorts and how much they cost.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/roplc5ly12k61.png?width=1198&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6a592938458cf6436e64ef2655b0bf193bfc6e9\n\nHere we can see that the number of shares available for short selling has gone from **2 million (at 1.1% borrow rate) to only 450,000 at 9% borrow rate**! The last time there were less than 500,000 shares available to borrow and interest rates above 5% (as seen through this site) was on **Jan 27** when we saw some huge intraday price swings.\n\n\\----------\n\n**Part 3: ETFs**\n\nThis data of course doesn't take into account the shorted shares in ETFs that have high stakes in GME. For example, 'EX AR TEE' is currently 175% shorted (16.1m shares on 9.2m) and GME as 9% of its portfolio.\n\n[https:\/\/www.etfchannel.com\/symbol\/xrt\/](https:\/\/www.etfchannel.com\/symbol\/xrt\/)\n\nDoing some quick math of \\~$73M of GME at $117 = 620k shares of GME x 185% short position = \\~1.1m GME shares shorted.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/449mbia022k61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=945faea5d149afac977bcc480592b3bdbf4d5274\n\n[https:\/\/www.etfchannel.com\/article\/202102\/xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-large-outflows-detected-at-etf-xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-XRT02192021.htm\/](https:\/\/www.etfchannel.com\/article\/202102\/xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-large-outflows-detected-at-etf-xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-XRT02192021.htm\/)\n\nThey have even published an article singling out this ETF because there is a huge outflow of shares being dissolved (ie shorted).\n\n>\u201c\u2026we have detected an approximate $85.8 million dollar outflow -- that's a 12.0% decrease week over week (from 9,200,000 to 8,100,000).\u201d\n\nIf these numbers are true, then it is shorted closer to 199%! (16.1m shorts \/ 8.1m shares).\n\nNOTE: you cannot squeeze an ETF as it is just a collection of shares, the fund can increase and decrease the total number of shares it owns as the size of the fund grows \/ shrinks. this is why the article above was talking about an outflow of money from the ETF\n\n\\----------\n\n**TLDR:**\n\nTHEY ARE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO STOP THIS ROCKET JUST LIKE LAST TIME, BUT **\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c** \ud83d\udc8e will prevail!!!\n\n**Stake:** shares in GME **\ud83d\ude80** **\ud83d\ude80** **\ud83d\ude80**\n\n**PS:** you guys!

For all you apes out there all that means is the higher you go, the faster you go higher. This trend started in August. It will likely continue as long as Ryan Cohen and the folks he brought over do good work. Now lets address those large spikes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[January Ape welcoming party, no despair here.](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/x7vxju4trvj61.png?width=3057&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ed649938b25bcb7e461ba4ec794d56bbe72fa33)\n\nSee this, its a classic example of a textbook speculation bubble (dont panic just breathe and read, if you're having trouble go ask your wifes bf to read it out loud for you.)\n\n[See](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/syvpt1m4tvj61.png?width=882&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e65377fc7cfcbd212a6ff8ca714ca330fedf02e)\n\nSo a speculation bubble occurred, but why? What caused it and what does that mean going forward? Especially with the recent activity yesterday and today.\n\nFirstly I am not a financial advisor, and I don't give financial advice.\n\nSecondly to answer is pretty simple this was caused by millions of apes rushing to the stock market to buy GME duh. News goes viral about the squeeze the apes buy, paper hands sell. Ok but that sounds really bad right? Again not necessarily. Bubbles like this happen all the time on all just about anything that can be traded over time scales ranging from a few hours to a few months. One of the things that makes GME such unique opportunity is that there is an incredibly tiny number of available shares relative to its market cap. This important for the squeze but it also means the price is more susceptible to dramatic price fluctuations. In fact it is this property that make a squeeze possible, its the nitrous in your gas that turns it into rocket fuel. Imagine you and all your neighbors are on a life raft in the middle of the ocean and everyday you get 10 gallons of water to share between you that no big deal but what happens when 10 gallons turns to 9 then 8 then 7 and so on. the less water (available shares) the more volatile you and your neighbors get until eventually everything goes MAD MAX and you have all the water to yourself.\n\nso the speculation boils down to....is this the Squeeze? did it squouze? am i too late? So what does that mean for the apes that boarded at 200 250 400. Well nothing the Price is going to jump around a lot and every time it should settle a little bit higher than before, all the while costing the shorts more and more interest, until the squeeze goes off or the market value has reached your cost basis and you're wishing you bought more dip so you could have averaged down and made a profit by now.\n\nAdditionally if you assume the price jump was in fact speculative bubble it means the shorts couldn't really have covered without guaranteeing rocket launch. those arrogant entitled assholes would have had to look in the mirror admit they lost and launch the rocket themselves. OR they could lie to you, and double down. Historically they double down because its not their personal money and the hate being wrong almost as much as they hate losing money\n\nPersonally I don't think the shorts will ever capitulate on their own. I think that it will end in one of 3 ways.\n\n1 SEC will turn up some smoking gun of some kind in an investigation that cant be swept away, and a scapegoat will be offered to the public\n\n2 their clearing house will call their the short positions in and they'll go belly up\n\n3 the shorts are right and we're either too dumb or too distracted to out last them\n\nJust to be clear these are all short term endings. The long term end is basically Cohen and Friends save GAMESTOP and turn it into a digital platform powerhouse, or they don't. They got a pretty good track record though. I mean Chewy sells pet food and toys and its valued at nearly 6 times what GAMESTOP is, don't get me wrong I love my dogs but I spend way more on video games each year than I do on pet food and supplies, and I don't think I'm the only one.\n\nOK, so that covers Jan but what about today and yesterday. Well yeah short answer is I'm not sure, but my best guess is that as a result of some options trading practices someone had to buy a bunch of shares to hedge those options and because the available supply is being restricted by all you apes the price reacted extra sensitively kicking off even more hype. This would be a good sign as it means that the fuel mixture (volatility) is getting super powered and just waiting for the right ignition (catalyst.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Just so you know I where I stand](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/bnps5z3z8wj61.png?width=2409&format=png&auto=webp&s=84d2dc21952c6ff352955f0bb9a2c67035185815)\n\nTL;DR I like the stock.

Yay.","1060":"On GME and index re-balancing. DD from behind a Wendy's. Alright, I know most of you can't read anything longer than a fortune cookie, so I'm putting this right up here at the top:\n\nTL;DR -   \n1. GME market cap goes up  \n2. Index funds end up underweight GME  \n3. They must fix this before May\/June, or losses are locked in  \n4. Tendies   \n\n\nSo I was sucking on the Frosty machine at Wendy's when I decided to look into what it might mean for GME when it moves from the Russell 2000 (small cap) to the Russell 1000 (large cap) in May and June.  This typically doesn't mean much for a single stock, but with the volatility we've seen with GME already, as well as the percentage change in market cap, I think this may be more significant for GME than most companies.\n\nFTSE Russell does a big giant rebanlacing that lasts about two months in May and June.  Link here for the 2020 schedule. [https:\/\/www.ftserussell.com\/press\/ftse-russell-announces-2020-russell-us-indexes-reconstitution-schedule](https:\/\/www.ftserussell.com\/press\/ftse-russell-announces-2020-russell-us-indexes-reconstitution-schedule) .  The 2021 dates aren't released yet but should be basically the same.  Because of the recent run-up in price on GME, it is set for a move from the Russell 2000 to the Russell 1000.  This same price increase also left many active fund managers underweight in GME, and they are losing out on recent gains.\n\nAll of this means Russell 2000 active fund managers who are underweight in GME right now, only have about 2-3 months to attempt to fix it before it gets taken out of the index, and their under performance on GME gets locked in.  It's quite possible that they are helping to form a large part of the floor, and their increasingly desperate attempts to not have the underweight GME locked in at re-balancing time will cause more and more volatility as the deadline approaches.\n\n A recent comparison I would like to make is to TSLA, both because of its retail popularity, short interest, and volatility leading up to SP500 inclusion.  S&P announced that TSLA would be added to the index on Nov. 17, 2020, and it was officially added on Dec. 21. In that time, it's stock price went from $441 to $649, with an overall increase in market cap of over $200 billion dollars.  With a current market cap of around $5-10 Billion dollars depending on the day, it takes a lot less money to move the price on GME, and with the high likelihood of underweight Russell 2000 index funds, we may see even more volatility leading up May\/June than we have so far this year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDisclosure - I am long GME.  This is not financial advice.  I used to work at Wendy's but was fired.","1061":"Simply put, GME is actually extremely undervalued long term. Fellow retards, I might be retarded but I'm just thinking about the future of GME. Ryan Cohen and team turned Chewy into a company worth 40 Billion. Currently trading at 103 a share. Chewy does not have a ton of assets its just an online e-commerce pet store. He beat Amazon out to become the primary pet supply online retailer.\n\nGME actually has real assets, stores all across the country. Imagine what he could do with that. GME 3.8B market cap is absolutely undervalued.\n\nRyan Cohen saw an opportunity with gamestop, to take a dying company and turn it around doing what he ALREADY KNOWS HOW TO DO.\n\nIn short, I like the stock. If I can make some money on a squeeze I'm happy - if somehow things don't work out with a squeeze I'm happy to hold. I'm looking at bringing my average down soon and holding unless this thing pops off to the 1000s.\n\nDFV is a very smart man. \n\nPos: 46 GME @ 133","1062":"GME: We don't know how many shares can be shorted \/sigh\n\nI keep seeing posts and even dedicated threads doing super in-depth analysis of the number of shares available to short. Nearly all of these cite https:\/\/iborrowdesk.com\/report\/GME\n\nListen tardy: That's one broker. That's just InteractiveBrokers. It's one of many data points and does not mean much by itself. They could get more available shares because their clients bought GME stock. They could lose available shares because their clients sold GME stock. They could lose available shares because someone borrowed them to short. They could lose available shares because someone asked that their shares not be lent out.\n\nThere are many brokers. There are large \"dark pool\" transactions that do not pass through brokerages. [Fintel](https:\/\/fintel.io\/ss\/us\/gme) is a better source, though their numbers are imperfect as well. \n\nSo yes, keep half an eye on short volume and the number of shares available to short. It's an interesting metric. But don't obsess over it, and don't make big assumptions about every fluctuation. To some degree we're stuck with very limited information. We can only guess what the missing pieces might be.

For all the new GME investors who might be slightly confused about why and how the hedge funds have gotten themselves backed into this corner..\n\nMelvin and friends thought that GameStop was a failing company, so they decided to short it's stock. They got so greedy, they decided that they would short the company by more stock than actually existed (naked short selling),  such was their confidence that GameStop was worthless.\n\nThe very act of doing this, if it hadn't been discovered might very well have driven Gamestop into bankruptcy, with the company still being viable.\n\nWhen a company goes bankrupt, the short sellers don't haver to buy back or return the stock, so if GameStop had been driven into bankruptcy, this dirty illegal tactic they used might never have been exposed. By not having to buy the stock back, they make maximum profit on their short trade, and don't even have to pay any taxes on their profits. This is a short sellers wet dream.\n\nTens of thousands of people lose their jobs, homes get repossessed, suicides increase, families devastated, all while Melvin and his buddies eat caviar, sip champagne on balconies and count their ill gotten gains. It really is the devil's work what they do.\n\nBut now that the hedgie's devious ways have been exposed and shared with apes allover the world, Melvin and his friends can never drive GameStop into the ground, so they will be forced to buy back the shares at some stage. And because they were so greedy by naked short selling, now they have to buy back more shares than actually exist. They sold fake counterfeit shares, but they need to buy back real shares, the shares we own.\n\nSo even if you only hold 1 share, they need it. They need to buy every single share that actually exists to cover their position. And that is why 1 share of GameStop is worth whatever price you're willing to sell for, even if it's $500k and above.\n\nFor the last few weeks, Melvin and friends have been using even dirtier tactics, trying to fool us all into thinking that they do not need our shares.\n\nDo not fall for this. They will use every psychological tactic they can to convince you to sell. Manipulating the price, turning off the buy button via RobinHood, paying media to say they have already covered etc. They are going to be using even dirtier tactics over the coming weeks,  some that we haven't event thought of yet.\n\nAll we need to do is hold ; nothing else, and get on with life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs an Irish Ape, I will finish by sharing an Irish patriotic saying..\n\n\"*Tiocfaidh Ar La - Our Day will Come\"*","1064":"DON'T SELL AT A LOSS.

I'll explain why.\n\n*DISLAIMER: I've only been trading for a few years and I only know this shit because I have a mentor in finance who taught me this stuff, and he hasn\u2019t steered me wrong yet. So take it for what it\u2019s worth... But based on all the fact that paper-handing is even an issue here, you apes clearly need this advice.* ***EDIT: These are \"fundamentals\" to the way I trade, but obviously everyone's trading strategy is different. Note that this is a quantitative approach to investing, which doesn't encourage YOLO-ing. This is ONE WAY to invest which does not require you to \"outsmart\" the general public by spotting opportunities\/value before the market does. Now personally, I like GME and AMC... I just like the way the letters look when I pull up my portfolio. This trading strategy is particularly relevant to those stocks, but is also relevant to the stock of any established, large company. The ticker symbol is less important than what you do with it. There are countless other approaches to trading (which often require more experience) but I feel this is most accessible to new investors. GME is the hot stock right now but this applies to everything. Well, everything that you don\u2019t think will go bankrupt or get delisted.***\n\n**New traders, or people who are thinking of becoming new traders, should read this.** Especially if you're new, I think you should follow these guidelines to avoid losing serious money in the stock market. This applies to all stock, not just GME. (edit: sorry if at any point I\u2019m making it sound like this is the definitive way to trade. My bad. Everyone\u2019s strategy is different, but this works well if you\u2019re patient, not emotional about it and would rather pay in \u201copportunity cost\u201d than losing money. If you\u2019re worried about opportunity cost, invest less!) Since a friend of a friend told me he paper-handed on GME (sold the dip), I feel compelled to explain why what he did was a bad idea.\n\n**I would encourage people to buy the stocks they like, but only with money you are willing to say goodbye to for a while.** (edit: in addition, just to reiterate, keep plenty of money in reserve so you can buy more if the stock goes down) By this I mean **NEVER SELL AT A LOSS**. Simply hold or buy more to bring your cost average down. All newbie investors (IMO) should adhere to this rule just in general. Buy stock prepared to ride it into the ground, or don\u2019t buy it at all.\n\nMany investors, myself included, follow this rule religiously with all stocks. I have never lost money in the stock market because I never sold at a loss, I just held or bought more. COVID crashed the market while my portfolio was maxed out? I just held and was fine... should have bought more. If everyone purchasing a heavily shorted stock bought in with this mindset, I bet it would go to Pluto easily.\n\nNow let's say you're buying a heavily shorted stock... if you sell at a loss, you are donating to the \"save the short sellers\" fund out of your own wallet, fucking yourself over and betraying your fellow apes, and you\u2019re not even following sound investment practice. Just chain yourself to that rocket and enjoy. If you\u2019re thinking of investing so much that you\u2019ll wuss out, poop your diaper and smash the sell button with shaking paper hands at the slightest hint of red... just don\u2019t. Emotion and the stock market do not mix well.\n\nStop losses (below purchase price) are also for pansies and genuine idiots. \u201cI\u2019ll sell you some stock... but only if you give me a bad enough price on it.\u201d Your plan should be to BUY when the stock goes down... if you feel like you need a stop loss below cost basis, you're probably investing more than you should. Instead of being stupid, maybe try investing less and keep money in reserve so you can buy the dips. (edit: I'm sure there are experienced value investors to whom these types of orders are valuable, but for the average ape who cannot assess the value of a stock, they're generally just to hedge a gamble of more money than you probably should have invested to begin with. Personally, I like strategies that allow me to make money even if the stock goes down.)\n\nSide note: personally, in the case of a stock with a potential short squeeze, I don\u2019t have any limit sells either. From what I can tell on past short squeezes, the price seems to go parabolic for at least half a day before coming back down. So as long as you keep an eye on it when it actually does skyrocket, you should have plenty of time. Set price alerts and relax. No need to shoot yourself in the foot by ditching the rocket mid-launch. (Some in the comments have brought up that you can use a trailing stop exit strategy. This is cool, and especially good if you can't watch it! But for example, if you place a 20% trailing stop, make sure you're 20% up when it gets placed!)\n\nAlthough, if you want you can try to profit off volatility on the WSB favorites. Some people are getting shamed for taking profits but I'm not sure they deserve it. As far as I know, buying low and selling high doesn\u2019t really help HFs, it drives the price up (just not as much as buying and holding). But personally, my philosophy is, I can take baby profits anytime... who knows when these opportunities will come around again. I'll note my positions, which are admittedly small, because I follow my own advice on not overinvesting. These are just the stocks I personally like: 101 GME averaging $106\/share, 1000 AMC averaging $11.07\/share.\n\nWant to get into the game now? You could always just buy a few shares, and keep the rest of what you\u2019re willing to invest in reserve in case of a dip. And buy a little bit more each time it goes down more, bringing your cost average down. Ideally, you should always have a loose plan for how much you will buy at each phase if the stock goes down to near zero. Always try to keep cash in reserve.\n\nLocked yourself in at a high price? That's why you keep cash in reserve so you can buy the dip and average down. Didn't keep any cash in reserve? Guess you're stuck waiting for one of three things: 1) the short squeeze which will likely (though not certainly) happen in the case of GME, 2) for the price of the stock to rise naturally over years as the value of the company increases, or 3) you get your hands on some more cash you're willing to say goodbye to bring your cost average down. **DO NOT SELL AT A LOSS** and you will never lose (edit: well, seldom, if ever. Unless the company goes bankrupt, a rare occurrence. This is why you don't put all your eggs in one basket, and plan so even if you buy all the way down to zero, it won't swallow your portfolio. Also, if you truly fucked up and used money that you need for health insurance or something, you may just have to back at least partially out with your tail between your legs and consider it a lesson). Hedge funds and billionaires know this, that's why their wealth increased so dramatically during the pandemic. They bought the dip while regular folks paper-handed and got even poorer.\n\nOne more little trick. If you manage to scoop up a nice juicy 100 shares, then even if your position goes \u201cunderwater,\u201d you can always sell covered calls at above your average cost, bring DOWN your cost basis, and make money off your stock \u201crisk free\u201d while still following the rule of never sell at a loss. Make sure they are covered, i.e. you hold onto the actual stock for the duration of the call, otherwise it\u2019s actually extremely risky. Although if you sold even a covered call on certain WSB favorites right this second the risk would be missing out on a once in a lifetime historic short squeeze. Bear in mind though it may take months for the squeeze to actually happen, and you'll need to be patient and, like I said before, say goodbye to your money for a while. *\"The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient.\" -Warren Buffet*\n\n**EDIT:** Just to reiterate, there are many trading strategies and I just feel this is one of the best for newbies. Trade however you want, just know that if you paper hand GME\/AMC at a loss, you're screwing yourself and others who bought the stock. I would also note that you *can* sell some shares below your cost basis and still follow this rule, if your sell is paired with a buy order that you executed at a lower price. It still follows the rule of \"don't sell at a loss.\" Buy one share at $90 and sell it at $100, doesn't matter if you still have 100 shares in the red from earlier. You can even (slowly) take your cost basis down by doing the thing where you buy a share when it goes down 5%, and sell one when it goes up 5%.\n\n**EDIT:** Yes I know about opportunity cost. It does apply if you know something the general public doesn\u2019t (rare if you\u2019re just a low IQ ape like me but recent WSB favorites are an exception). Many traders make money hopscotching between stocks regardless of loss but unless you know something the market doesn't, it could be a coin flip whether you'll hit rock bottom. In an ideal world, you can keep some money in reserve so you don\u2019t have to realize losses to jump on new opportunities. Yes I know about (and agree with) the sunk cost fallacy. My point is about gradually buying as the stock depreciates and becomes a better deal, lowering the cost basis, not \u201cdoubling down\u201d on sunk cost.\n\nTl;dr \ud83e\udd8dbuy \ud83c\udf4c, don\u2019t give \ud83d\udc0d \ud83c\udf4c unless \ud83d\udc0d give more than \ud83e\udd8dpay for \ud83c\udf4c\n\nNot financial advice, and definitely not good financial advice.

I am not a ~~cat~~ financial advisor\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI believe, in a time like this, a lot of people need a fresh glass of some ice cold water...\n\n# Splashed right into their faces.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTl;dr Ape explanation: I want GME to moon, but I am concerned about people being fed false information. 1. The claim Melvin said they didn't close their short position at the hearing is a lie. Their opening statement specifically had them saying they DID close it. 2.  The strategy of ITM calls boosting the price was tested last time & failed last time. These are covered calls. 3. There isn't enough of a short interest to force the price up by holding. The profit comes when HF close positions, but you won't know that happened until it's over.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would love to see GME rocket to the moon. And I believe there is a scenario where that can be possible. But I want to go over the popular scenarios that will deceive you into believing THEY are the scenarios that will lead you to the moon. This is not a bear post against GME. This is reality.\n\n* This is for those of you newcomers who thought you missed out on the last GME wave.\n* This is for those of you who were stuck holding the bag last time (me, included) and are looking at profiting from this time to make that money back.\n* This is for those of you who just didn't learn your lesson, and need a reminder of what went down last time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs I said, there are scenarios where GME can be squeezed. But what scenario is that? And what scenarios are not that?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. First thing first, I want to stop a lie that I have seen spread like wildfire. The blatant lie that Melvin Capital, during the Gamestop hearing, admitted to not closing out their short position on Gamestop. This is not true. Now, I am going to assume whoever came up with this lie, did it as a *valiant* effort to help boost the price of Gamestop, and probably hoped no one would call them out on their BS, because nobody else decided to waste their time, watching a 5+ hour congressional hearing about stocks. Those are about the two most boring things in the world, combined. But, you don't even have to get that far into the hearing to call this lie out for the BS that it is. In Melvin Capital's opening statement, within the first minute of it, they state they closed out of their short positions in GME days before any restrictions were put on it. You can look up videos of the opening statements, yourself. I won't baby you that much. So, in conclusion, don't rely on the scenario that Melvin never closed out their short positions. It's a lie and it needs some water doused on it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. Scenario Two, possibly the most believed strategy on GME Thursday\/Friday: \"Keeping the price over **(insert dollar amount here),** by Friday close, makes **(insert number here)** of calls ITM, and when they cover, the price is going to rocket!\" Now, I am not going to say this scenario is impossible, but it is not very likely, and it is what got many people burned the last time. Yes, it is true, keeping the price over a certain price, making a lot of calls ITM, can be good for the stock... **IF** those calls aren't covered calls, which I believe that almost all of them are. The week ending Jan. 22nd, there are probably a lot of naked calls. That hurt the sellers, bad, when GME closed at a very high price. Nobody expected it. That helped it a lot the following week when we saw the big spike. But then, let's run down what happened that following week. Yes, RH restricted buying on Thursday, 28th, which I do believe stopped the biggest of the squeezed, but it would not have played a role in the ineffectiveness of the \"Calls ITM\" strategy that followed. That Thursday, the price plummeted into the $200s. That Friday, you heard a lot of chatter of ***\"As long as we can get the stock up to $310, a lot of calls will be ITM and we will be golden, my fellow apes! Get it to $320 and that's bonus points. That will be 90k calls that will be ITM and have to cover. That's 9 MILLION SHARES!\"*** And yeah, A lot of that was true. There were 90k calls that would be ITM if we closed above $320. And you know what we did? We closed above $320. We closed around $328, in fact. This was it. Come Monday, that price was going to the moon. *\"10k isn't a meme!\"* We chanted. We couldn't be wrong. We did the maths. We had the DD. Diamonds don't crack, baby! Well, come Monday, there was no lift off. It was the Space Shuttle Columbia all over again. The stock fell, and it fell hard. Going back into the low $200s, dipping into the $100s even, before closing in the $200s. That's okay though. That's fine. They had until Wednesday to *actually* close on those Calls, you'd hear. So Tuesday came and went. Then Wednesday too. We never saw $300 again. In fact, by Friday, we were barely even seeing $100. So what happened? What went wrong? We had maths **AND** anime on our side. Well, what I believe happened is, those Call contract sellers learned their lesson that first week that ended Jan. 22nd, when they got screwed. They didn't let their calls be naked the following week. They bought up GME stocks when it was low at the beginning of that week, if they didn't already have them. This allowed them to resell those stocks at $320 and under, making them the big winners in all of this. But that meant these weren't NEW stocks that would help us go higher. No, these were stocks bought on the way up. They helped us peak but wouldn't help us go ***over*** the peak. So, when those calls executed, there were suddenly a lot of new holders of GME stock. Holders who saw their stocks were worth $300-$320. These weren't diamond handers, like you or I. These apes wanted their bananas ***NOW.*** So they sold when they got them. Gotta cash in those profits at some point. As WSB loves saying \"*You can't lose if you don't sell\"*. Well, you also can't win if you don't sell. So now flash forward a month later, and the same theory is being pushed. \"*Keep the price over $100 and we will rocket to $800 come Monday. No, scratch that, $1000. No, wait, even better. $69,420!\"* You hear in the echo chamber, bouncing off the walls like GME does in the first 30 minutes of market open. That's not going to happen. These are covered calls that are ITM. You're not forcing anyone to buy new stocks at the current price. You are just buying stocks for $50-$100 that were already bought at $40-$60 and are keeping the stock price stagnant. And none of this is even mentioning that the amount of ITM calls this time is like a third of what it was last time. So, do not rely on this strategy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. Scenario Three: *\"tHeY hAvE tO cOveR. tHeN wE cAn sEt oUR oWn pRicE\"*. This is probably the most ignorant reason, and is why I typed it out like that. Yeah, I'm mocking you. Get over it. it is true, they do have to cover eventually. But not with your stocks. GME short interest is somewhere around 45-50% (too lazy to relook up the actual number), and this is after new reports showed 1.3 million more shares were shorted on Wednesday. Now, yes, that is a high amount of short interest. But that isn't high enough for the **\"Diamond Hands\"** approach. There's still 50ish percent of shares out there, not shorted. And yes, Diamond Handers hold a lot of those, most are going to be held by institutions and those institutions are about the money, not the message. They see a 3x profit? They sell. They sell to whoever is willing to buy. Could be more Diamond Handers, could be hedge funds. But eventually, Apes are going to run out of money to buy and hold with. That's when the Hedge Funds can swoop in, buy up these stocks, cover their short positions. The people they borrowed from might not be Diamond Handers, and end up selling to more Hedge Funds. When the short interest is only around 50%, you can't win with the Buy\/Hold strategy. When the short interest is 50%, the short squeeze happens and you don't know it happens until it is over and the Hedge Funds have covered. You win by riding the wave up as Hedge Funds cover and then you get out near the top. That's the end of your ride. The ride doesn't just keep going up. You can only set the price when you own most of the market, and in this case, we don't. And on top of all of that, you also have people who are doing this with their bill money. The 1st of the month is coming up, that's a lot of rent needing paid. No shame in needing to sell so you can pay your bills. But, that's more shares that will flood the market. Probably a fraction of the actual amount of shares out there, but pennies add up to dollars eventually.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd those are the three scenarios in which you have a higher chance of losing than winning. Again, I cannot stress this enough: I **DO** believe a short squeeze can happen with GME. But I do not believe it is any of these three scenarios that will make it happen. I'm just tired of seeing people being fed these these  delusional optimistic claims that throw truth, history, and **REAL** DD & common sense out the window, treating GME more like a PnD than an actual short squeeze.  it's okay to drink the Kool-aid, but maybe check to make sure it isn't spiked first.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I've been trying to reply to as many people as I can. If they took their time to indulge me, read  my post, and then spend their time writing a rebuttal to it, I wanted to respect that and give them a proper response, but it's getting a bit tiring and I have other things to do, so I will not be replying to any further comments. I might keep going with the fun conversations, but for the rest, I will not be.","1066":"Short intrest Friday Data from\u00a0https:\/\/highshortinterest.com\/\n\nGameStop (GME) - 41.22% Short Interest\n\nTanger Factory Outlet Centers (SKT) - 39.98%\n\nAcademy Sports & Outdoors (ASO) - 37.18%\n\nRocket Companies (RKT) - 35.73%\n\nGogo (GOGO) - 35.04%\n\nClovis Oncology (CLVS) - 34.54%\n\nTriterras (TRIT) - 32.04%\n\nMadrigal Pharmaceuticals (MDGL) - 31.60%\n\nGSX Techedu (GSX) - 31.19%\n\nOntrak (OTRK) - 30.86%\n\nLannett Company (LCI) - 28.97%\n\nAccelerate Diagnostics (AXDX) - 28.95%\n\nRevlon (REV) - 28.22%\n\nBlink Charging (BLNK) - 28.18%\n\nCorbus Pharmaceuticals (CRBP) - 27.81%\n\niSun (ISUN) - 27.37%\n\nIntercept Pharmaceuticals (ICPT) - 26.95%\n\nCarvana (CVNA) - 26.32%\n\nVaxart (VXRT) - 26.30%\n\nSmileDirectClub (SDC) - 26.23%\n\nSunPower (SPWR) - 25.86%\n\nTootsie Roll (TR) - 25.56%\n\nRetractable Technologies (RVP) - 25.42%\n\nPrecigen (PGEN) - 25.21%\n\nBed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) - 25.00%\n\nBeyond Meat (BYND) - 23.53%\n\nRubius Therapeutics (RUBY) - 23.49%\n\nKaryopharm Therapeutics (KPTI) - 23.36%\n\nSorrento Therapeutics (SRNE) - 23.09%\n\nOpko Health (OPK) - 23.07%\n\n\u00a0","1067":"Really long DD and Analysis! What happened yesterday explained in detail and exposing the HFs obvious manipulation. Good morning everyone, this is an important update to what happened yesterday!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst of all: I made a prediction in my post yesterday . The prediction would've become reality, if Hedgies didn't overshort with fake shares (more about that in a second). Why do I tell you this? I literally received death threats and insults when the market ended. Just a heads up: Those are PREDICTIONS, they can be faulty at times, especially when Hedgies do such unexpected things, that no Data can predict (again, more about that in a second). So please, for the love of god, don't harass me, insult me, or send me death threats when something like that happens. I understand your frustration, but don't target me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow the juicy stuff; **What exactly happened yesterday? Here is a timeline:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**9:35 AM:** The market opened and we had a huge drop off in price and a HUGE spike in volume. Hedgefunds shorted over 18,363,000 Shares (over the first 5 minutes. The amount of shorting was so aggressive, that trading got halted twice within the first minutes.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/w8qgdhc52tj61.png?width=1174&format=png&auto=webp&s=312ade6cbbff842f8f1c2b85707b9ee414bc5af4\n\n**9:45 AM TO 1:50 PM**: Trading pretty much went in our favor the whole time, people kept buying in, we hit the daily high of $185 at around 1PM and went sideways for almost 1 hour after that\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/y22hod9b2tj61.png?width=622&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfc15d4f0d31ef8a0f2f1ebfaa90c412711b4b22\n\n**1:55PM**: Shit gets interesting. Really aggressive shorting for the second time that day brings the price down to $126. At that point in time, between 5,000,000 and 7,000,000 shares were shorted in the blink of an eye. What stood out for me at that point in time is, that the price kept going in the same direction after every short attack (between $100 and $125). That tells me, it was really important to get the price down in that direction. (more in a few seconds)\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/osl59mnb2tj61.png?width=525&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfb0f9aa432f6ca45348aa39708ba4786f6f6572\n\n**2PM TO 3:25PM**: People buying in again, driving the price up to $140 - $150. And Now shit gets juicy.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ha1vws1c2tj61.png?width=1049&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd0bd0a7e87335c977ce9581b3a19ef335e37c31\n\n**3:30PM TO 4:00PM**: The 3rd aggressive short attack begins and keeps on going for 30 minutes, until the market closes. 10,000,000 shares were shorted in this time span.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/7hp3ktgc2tj61.png?width=1177&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4c655e876c22f10194d1e86c2e8c0edfe03e787\n\nNOW THE ANALYSIS:\n\n**WHERE DID THEY GET SO MANY SHARES TO SHORT GME AND WHY WAS IT NOT PREDICTABLE?**\n\nSo, how could no one forsee this? It's simple: Hedgefunds didn't borrow shares to short, they created them out of thin air. When the market opened yesterday, ALL available $GME Shares to borrow, were gone already (see my second edit from yesterday:  **EDIT2 (10AM): 0 SHORTS AVAILABLE FOR $GME RIGHT NOW. THEY BORROWED OVER 2,100,000 SHARES TO SHORT FOR YESTERDAY AND TODAY**! ([https:\/\/fintel.io\/ss\/us\/gme](https:\/\/fintel.io\/ss\/us\/gme); [https:\/\/iborrowdesk.com\/report\/GME](https:\/\/iborrowdesk.com\/report\/GME)) What does this mean? Well, no one can predict or analyse how deep they are digging their grave right now, because they are not using real shares to short GME. They can just keep doing it in order to hold the price down artificially.\n\n**WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE ADD UP TO SHORTS AND PRICE DIPS MENTIONED ABOVE?**\n\nNow it just gets stupidly funny and obvious. If we add up the three big short attacks (18,363,000 right at opening, 5,000,000 to 7,000,000 at noon and about 10,000,000 right before close), we get 33,363,000 shares sold short over the day. Why is this funny and obvious? Check the latest FINRA report. It states that yesterday more than 33,000,000 were sold short. That's almost exactly the number that we get when we add up the volume of the dips.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/d3vuakyd2tj61.png?width=453&format=png&auto=webp&s=494fb1b56197d7d997e2c0abdd2843f7bd538bcb\n\n**WHY DID THEY SHORT GME SO AGGRESSIVELY WITH FAKE SHARES?**\n\nBecause bears are fuk. See, when GME would've closed in between $115 and $150, over 44.000 Call options would've become ITM. If exercised, that would've driven up the price AH\/PRE or today in the high hundreds, maybe even thousands. Why is that so bad? The higher the price gets, the more calls get exercised (so called options chain), the more people jump in because of FOMO and we get closer to the magical $800 mark, where the MOASS would become inevitable this or next week.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/3djwn1de2tj61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ce4f2b20c430b672e8d4a5701c39c327f368e7b\n\n**WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THIS LOOKING FORWARD?**\n\nHedgies don't give a single fuck anymore. Even when all the data available states, that there are no more shorts available to borrow for GME, we found all of their ETFs where they hid their shorts, they keep shorting it to try and stop the MOASS. You know what they say: There is nothing more dangerous than an animal that's trapped in a corner and's got nothing to lose anymore. That's what we're seeing right now. No one can give accurate predictions anymore, that is based on data. This has evolved into a game of poor greed and emotions. They don't care about the long term results of their illegal actions, they just want to save their asses for some more weeks or even just days.\n\nIN SHORT: BE PREPARED FOR EVERYTHING, DON'T BE SCARED OF DIPS, THEY ARE MORE THAN LIKELY CREATED ARTIFICIALLY BY HIGHLY ILLEGAL SHORTING WITH FAKED SHARES!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR:** Hedgies are so fucked, that they just shorted GME with more than 33,000,000 non-existent shares yesterday, keeping the price down in order to stop the Gamma Squeeze from happening. The price would've jumped up to a few hundred, maybe even thousand dollars today if they didn't do it, which would've started the real squeeze today.

In the context of this document, a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company, is considered counterfeit. This is not a legal conclusion, since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon today's rules. The alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market, but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares, which leads to widespread stock manipulation \u2013 the lynchpin of this massive fraud.\n\nReturning to our example, everything is the same except the part about borrowing the share from someone else's account: There is no borrowed share \u2014 instead a new one is created by either the broker dealer or the DTC. Without a borrowed share behind the short sale, a naked short is really a counterfeit share.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT3(9:30AM): THE FEE TO BORROW GME SHARES WENT UP BY 12 % OVER NIGHT AND IS THEREFORE IN THE DOUBLE DIGITS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 4 WEEKS (**[**https:\/\/iborrowdesk.com\/report\/GME**](https:\/\/iborrowdesk.com\/report\/GME)**)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT4: How do I know that it was Hedgies and not Retail selling their shares?  It is possible, that some retail traders sold, but if you take a look at the Short volume (61 % yesterday with 51,000,000 shares being sold short) and then take a look at the overall sell volume, it doesn't add up. If there was a huge retail sell off and the additional 61 % short volume, the price drop would've been much much bigger.

I\u2019m trying to understand why GME and AMC spiked 100\u2019s % points a few weeks ago and then trading very similar to each to each other and both made moves this week. Is GME still the ONLY play here or is AMC the ugly sister that you\u2019ll have sex with to make the hotter sister jealous but you\u2019re going to enjoy it either way?\n\nMedia and forum group AMC and GME in every message or hit piece so I\u2019m worried AMC is just smoke and mirrors and GME is still the real play here. I\u2019m heavy into AMC with no stake in GME based on the DD I\u2019ve seen all over that AMC is going to squeeze hard just Probably not to the same level as GME because of a lot of reasons. AMC short interest is still very high and sketchy things around that data is going on.\n\nWhat are your apes opinions? Are you only GME or both AMC and GME? Is AMC a diversion or do they just want us to think that it is? Could AMC be the real opportunity now that GME already went to $480? Or are they both huge opportunities because hedge fuck hedge funds?","1069":"GME, WHAT WILL HAPPEN TODAY?

This post is for the newbie and or for the confused one. You PRO's forget it.*\n\n**AND SO... WHAT'S THIS GME STUFF TODAY?**\n\nFirst thing first: don't want to start a flame but... please STOP with this \"WE\" are taking GME to the moon. \"WE\" are not even taking GME to MC Donald's. Market are for big investors, the \"whales\". The \"normal\" people, those who buy 1, 10, 50 shares, simply doesn't have the \"force\" to move substantially the price of this share. Look at the book, there are entities buying and selling MOTHERLOADS of shares, I mean MILLIONS of $$$ like peanuts. These are the ones moving the price, not US. \"WE\" can help this, indeed, following the \"thrust\" when some whales decide to move a stock high or to sink it.\n\nSo the point is trying to speculate for the next move of the BIG PLAYERS, in order to eat some crumbs. But don't get depressed, for ape-birds, crumbs are LIFE.\n\nOK, but wasn't GME dead? Weren't the hedge founds out?\n\nIMO it's not a matter of hedge founds and short selling, it's a matter of OPTIONS. (if you don't know how options works start from here [https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/o\/option.asp](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/o\/option.asp) )\n\nToday February 26th, a lot of options expire, both calls and puts.\n\n**BUT**\n\nThere is a an imbalance towards the call ones, AKA there was a lot more of money in calls (so betting that GME would rise) than in puts (so betting GME would fall).\n\n**FACTS ENDING, SPECULATION STARTING**\n\nFebruary 23rd there was A HUGE selling in crypt0 currencies. I mean some people sold MILLIONS and MILLIONS and MILLIONS of crypt0s, in the middle of the greatest bull run of them all... STRANGE.\n\nThe very next day, someone, at 3:00 PM starts to resurrect an almost dead GME buying LOTS and LOTS of shares. Obviously, the one that have bought all these put options started to short GME in order to keep the price low, but NO: MR.X then places SHITLOAD of money and GME rises from $50 to $90 in just an hour. EVEN MORE STRANGE.\n\nI think that MR.X (that can or cannot be a single investor, maybe is a group of investors, maybe a whale, even a foreign country, who knows) decided to move all his crypt0 reserve in order to protect his huge investiment in GME calls.\n\n**SOUNDS GOOD.. GO ON!**\n\nNow, guess what... this night the crypt0 markets sank another time. Someone sold a LOT of coins... And today the option are expiring... do your math.\n\nI think that Mr.X will RISE GME today, at any cost.\n\n**OK, so GME to the MOON? ...but HOW far is the moon?**\n\nLet's look at the option chain: the big numbers (more than 10000 volume) are at these prices:\n\nCALLS: 150, 200, 250, 300, 400, 500, 800\n\nPUTS: 100, 50, 40\n\nThere are basically two forces: one that wants GME to stay OVER 150, better over 300, ideally over 800; one that wants GME to stay under 100, better under 50, ideally under 40.\n\n**NICE. SO WHAT WILL HAPPEN TODAY?**\n\nWell, maybe nothing.\n\nBut if someone start SHARPLY to buy loads of GME, and you see the price going 150, 200, 250, I bet it will continue to buy in order to reach 300. Then if the market \"feels\" the momentum, maybe it could reach 400 or 500. It's very difficult but not impossible reaching 800. But over 800 today... I don't think it will really happen.\n\nOtherwhise, if GME sinks UNDER 100, it will remain there. There is a remote possibility that will go down to 50, maybe 40, but not less than that.\n\n**MY HEAD HURTS. IT'S ALL SO COMPLICATED.**\n\nAs a matter of fact, it is EXTREMELY more complicated and unpredictable. Don't forget that in the game there are also the short sellers and the market makers... so everything could happen.\n\nBy the way... today CAN be an interesting day for GME... or maybe not?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT:** *at 6:30 AM EST the premarket is only +8,85%. IF someone wants to climb it up to the BIG numbers, will start buying BIG just at the opening. Otherwise you could hope for a pre-closing rally to reach 200,250,300 but not more. That's because of market halts (LULD), if would be impossible to push it to let's say 800 in only a couple hours, that would (maybe) need a full day of market halts and restarts.*\n*at 11:00 AM EST is floating around 125. IMO there's no time to reach 800 today. If rally starts, aim towards 250 \/ 300.","1070":"Do your own thing, but don't forget where you came from GME is special. Something this good isn't going to happen very often, but it will happen again... sometime.\n\nA little calculus or watching an interview with someone like Drukenmiller will inform you that it only takes a certain number of people getting out  to move the market enough to the sell side, thus removing  the needed support under a price.\n\nI'm not saying it will be a collapse of course; only that the collective buying, continued holding -- any tightly held stock enjoys being expensive to buy  -- and the special stuff a group of inspired people coming together creates, is what will guarantee GME  at or above $300.\n\nWhat I am saying is that looking for what will be the next great thing, will not find another GME, for now. Things like this tend to happen once and quite spectacularly, but almost never come in twos or threes. YMMV, and there's more money to be made as a retard.\n\nDISCLAIMER:  I'm just saying.  I bought 1 GME share yesterday, and lost 30% between the open and close, and figured as much; I'm now happy to be a part of this.  I have for a while, and continue only holding some amount of gold, for now.\n\nMy contention, is if you're long enough GME, you will, in that time probably watch the company do an offering  of as little  as 50M ordinary shares for up to $2B equity, or perhaps raise enough cash   on the back of a fuck-ton of the kind of  advertising you can't buy; like what Elon did at Tesla.  With enough cash to execute the e-commerce strategy, and transition to online, you might find that GameStop was in fact a $200 or $300 company.  This would be the true story of the company.\n\nMy point, is that you might do just as well to keep doing the same thing, and holding the line.\n\nThis is not any kind of advice of course, just someone's perspective. People should make up their own mind.\n\nNote: This is a repost from back when we were above $300.  Idk why it was deleted.","1071":"Another hypothesis on GME mid-week spike and major stock price drops Backstory:  First of all I want to thank everyone for their contributions in the  GME scandal. We truly stand on the shoulders of giants at this moment.  We accomplished way more than expected. So much excellent DD has  uncovered so many things and taught millions of people the inner  workings of Wall Street. Who would've thought a collective hive mind of  retail investors could compile a dossier of due diligence comparable to  the greatest teams of analysts at Citadel? Not me. But it happened  anyway. So here we are, 2021. Bigger than ever. Smarter than ever. More  learned than the learned learnest of the learned. Here's my small  contribution.\n\nThere are 2 types of  pressure on GME at the moment. One is from the shorts and one is from  the major shareholders selling options. Here's how their interests play  out:\n\nThe options sellers are  people who own the stocks and they want those options to expire  worthless. This gives rise to the Max Pain theorem. The Max Pain theorem  puts the optimal price for GME at $48 for options expiring 2-26-2021 so  the options sellers will try to get it down to that so they can  maximize their profits. You can verify this here: swaggy stocks site or some other-can't post link\n\nMeow,  the short sellers want the stock to go down on days when they don't  have to compete with options sellers, which is basically Monday through  Thursday. They have to be careful to not drop it below 10% in one day so  they don't trigger the short-sale-rule and get shorting halted. They  also have to be careful to keep it going in a direction that the Max  Pain price keeps adjusting downward every week so they don't have to  spend extra money fighting the options sellers.\n\nThe  naked short sellers, like Melvin Capital, learned their lesson in the  last squeeze and are now buying calls in case their shorts get into  trouble by a squeeze. So here's where the interests of the two types of  pressure collide. The shorts want cheap calls and the call sellers want  expensive calls that expire worthless.\n\nBefore  I get to the hypothesis, I want to mention something. I haven't seen  this mentioned so let me explain how dark pools and market manipulation  work. Hedge funds buy GME stocks from each other outside of the stock  market at a pre-arranged price(probably market close or whatever) so  that they don't change the market price and keep the volume low on the  market. Then it's much easier for them to manipulate the market with  it's low volume because they have a lot of buying power and can send  large orders through the market to change the price while doing all  their shorting\/covering in their dark pools.\n\nNow  that you know the forces at play, there is a way they could make even  more money. They could move the market up significantly any day other  than Friday and then let it fall back down on Friday and if it doesn't  go down enough, the options sellers will force it there. They make money  on they way up and on the way down buying and selling stocks and  options from retail investors. And by Occam's razor, this would make the  most sense.\n\nAs for the broader economy stock price drops, we all know real interest rates changed and some people decided to take profits from stocks and move to safer havens. We also know there is a sector rotation from indoorsy pandemic stocks to outdoorsy pandemic-is-over stocks. It isn't hedge funds covering GME shorts. They have calls for that.\n\nTLDR: Hypothesizzle: The mysterious run up of GME was orchestrated to steal ape money.\n\nPositions: $0 GME <-think about that\n\nInB4 Straw man \"Your post history suggests you're a shill...\" get over yourself, Yes or no ?\n\nInB4  Appeal to authority \"What makes you an expert? You don't know anything\"  This is a hypothesis. Prove it wrong or move along. Hang in there\n\nInB4  Appeal to doubt\/fear\/FOMO \"paper hands\/pussy\/HODL\" If you like the  stock, I'm happy for you. If you're flinging options like crazy, I fear  for you. I could be wrong and we'll see tomorrow but we should maintain  discipline and entertain all possibilities. I know 30% short interest is  extremely large and subject to squeeze. I know that number may be  manipulated(downward in this case). I believe hedge funds have calls to  cover their shorts.\n\nRemindme! 10 hours\n\nYou can have your damn time","1072":"Game Theory 101: why WSB will lose its tendies trying to squeeze stuff.

There are two prisoners who allegedly committed a crime together. If both prisoners snitch on each other, they'll both go to jail for a medium amount of time. If both prisoners keep quiet, it will be hard to prove they did anything wrong and they'll only go to jail for a little while. If one prisoner snitches but the other prisoner stays quiet, the prisoner who didn't snitch gets the book thrown at them and goes to jail for a long, long time.\n\nThis is the position the WSB diamond hands gang is in. If none of you sell, the stock moons. If all of you sell, the stock gets nuked. If some apes sell and other apes don't, the ones who sell make money and the ones who don't get caca shoved down their throats. **Each monkey on WSB has a strong incentive to have hands that are just a little bit less diamond than all the other monkeys' hands.**\n\n**2) Recursion. Let us assume for a moment that every monkey in this troop decides that GME really is going to $1,000.** **Every monkey thinks that when GME hits $1k, all the other monkeys will sell and then the price will crash.**\n\n**Smart monkeys will see the $1,000 top coming.** **They'll use their prehensile tails to enter sell orders at $999.** But then they'll realize that other monkeys will probably do the same thing, meaning GME's peak will really be at **$999**. So monkeys get a little smarter, and enter a sell order at **$998.** But now GME's only going to peak at $998, so monkeys enter sell orders for **$997. The same logic leads us to sell orders at $996, then $995, then $994, and all the way down to a more reasonable valuation.** The squeeze never gets squoze.\n\n**3) Why was Volkswagen different?** You've heard breathless accounts of how the VW shorts called up Porsche crying and begging for relief. Don't wait for Melvin to call all 4 million of us begging for a deal. Porsche bought up a huge chunk of VW stock. Porsche was the only prisoner; it wasn't going to snitch on itself. Porsche didn't have a recursion problem. **Porsche was an 800-pound gorilla. Porsche didn't have to keep an entire troop of howling monkeys in line to squeeze the shorts.**\n\n**TL;DR: 80 10-pound monkeys can't squeeze as hard as one 800-pound gorilla.**\n\nDisclaimer 4 modz: Just saying that WSB is at a structural disadvantage when short squeezing, not that WSB should coordinate more.

Why else between a period of two hours yesterday (most of which was after market) would a stock jump like this.

It is very possible that GME volume today could exceed 100M shares matching the average daily volume of such trillion dollar capitalization giants such as AAPL.\n\nThe fact that GME\u2019s volume could approach the volume of AAPL \u2013 a company whose sales are more than 30 times larger is of course absurd. But GME is not an investment idea on any normal cash flow analysis basis. It is the preeminent \u201cmeme stock\u201d which moves strictly on the highly reactive buy and sell flows created on the Reddit r\/wallstreetbets bulletin board.\n\n#### Copycat trading could overwhelm current clearing processes\n\nThe GME phenomenon represents a completely new dynamic in the markets that combines social media dissemination, mobile access and commission free trading to create a giant, highly directed pool of capital that could verticalize any stock at any time for no other reason than flow.\u00a0\n\nWhile this is certainly fun and perhaps profitable for traders involved it creates massive externality problems that could have very negative effects elsewhere in the market. We\u2019ve already seen how such massive volatility swings forced RobinHood to suspend trading in the stock in order to meet margin calls from its clearing house. RobinHood has since shored up its balance sheet, but it is unclear if it will have enough capital to withstand a fresh wave of activity, especially if the GameStop gambit proves successful for the speculators involved and will then attract 5X or 10X new flows that could propagate through many thinly traded, financially dubious securities creating massive 200%-500% daily moves.\n\n#### Regulators Will Need to Step In\n\nWe have arrived at the moment where the market execution technology is completely overrunning the clearance and settlement protocols that haven\u2019t changed much in centuries. It is absolutely clear that if \u201cmeme trading\u201d is to continue markets will need to go to instant settlement of transactions \u2013 a task easier said than done. The clearing of trades is a multi-trillion business with thousands of actors and a million moving parts that cannot just instantly switch to a 99.99% uptime regime in order to accommodate swarms of speculative flow. Yesterday\u2019s FEDWIRE wire issues that deal with clearing banking transactions \u2013 a much larger and more important business \u2013 is testament to the fact that financial systems are vulnerable to a \u201cbrownout\u201d event \u2013 much like the one that occurred in the energy markets in Texas as abnormal demand completely overran supply.\n\nThe events in Texas were tragic and in many ways preventable but the laissez faire attitude of regulators exacerbated the problems a thousand fold. The very same dynamic may occur in the financial markets if regulators do not take control of the situation.\n\n#### Long term Bans may be the Only Policy Play\n\nAt this point it is unclear what regulators could do given the absence of quick legal, cultural and technological directives to instantly move to real-time settlement. The only choice of the regulators is to simply suspend trading in any security that moves more than 25% in a day absent any material financial information from the company. The suspensions would have to be far more draconian than the current\u00a0 versions that are in place. Regulators would in effect have to create system wide bans on any trading in the \u201cmeme stock\u201d security for days and perhaps weeks rather than minutes. The bans would have to be backed by strict civil penalties for any OTC trading of such securities so that the threat of punitive damages would cool off speculative flows.\u00a0\n\nIf a hobbyist Robin Hood trader who held $2000 of a suspended meme stock suddenly faced the prospect of a $50,000 fine for illegally trading it, the speculative fervor would cool.\n\n#### Anathema to Free Markets\n\nThis is of course a complete anathema to the notion of friction free securities markets where any participant is at liberty to do use his capital as he pleases. It is undoubtedly a drastic solution to the problem at hand, but for now it may be the only policy choice to make given the unintended consequences of letting this phenomena play itself out without any supervision.\n\nThe current financial system is simply unprepared and incapable of absorbing highly coordinated speculative flows that could overrun the underlying business of the global capital markets. The ultimate irony of the GameStop saga is that the very technology that has created unimaginable freedom to transact instantly at minimal cost may invite the most restrictive response imaginable in order to avoid a massive destabilization of the markets.\u00a0\n\n[www.60secondinvestor.com](https:\/\/www.60secondinvestor.com)","1076":"What if GME mooning and upcoming inflation concerns are related So, I\u2019ve been reading lots of DD posts lately, maybe too much.

Also, $6 Billion is the lowest yearly revenue GME has had since 2007. \n\n***\n>Here\u2019s the thing \u2013 the average Price to Earnings Ratio (P\/E) for retailers is 20.54 \u2013 so <$20 of share price per dollar of EPS. For digital retailers, the average is 38.96 \u2013 almost $40 of share price per dollar of EPS.\n***\n**Response:** PE ratios have gone wild this year so I would not use current PE ratios as a baseline for fundamental value. Apples PE went from 19.73 in early 2020 to 33.92 currently. You compared GME to Best Buy and Best Buy has a PE ratio of 17.71.\n\n***\n>Assuming GameStop makes a strong move into the digital space and shores up their balance sheet, their pure fundamental fair value is conservatively (with no short squeeze) anywhere from a minimum of $65 (minimal profits and a market average PE ratio) to $400 (10% profit on 2020 revenue and digital retailer average PE ratio) per share.\n***\n**Response:** First, those are huge assumptions. GME only has to capture a lot of the digital market and also fix their losing money problem. I have no idea what magic you used to arrive at $65 or $400 per share. Their EPS is very red; their revenue is falling; and now they have to transition their entire business. I\u2019m not sure if you are delusional or criminal.","1078":"Thoughts on the recent crash hysteria Time for a different type of DD.\n\nI've been seeing a lot of talk and posts recently about a supposed crash being right around the corner. Mentions of the post WWI Weimar republic hyper-inflated Germany, USD collapses, and mass transfers of wealth from the poor to the rich. **An autistic hedge fund manager with an MD tweets a few times and everyone loses their minds (insert Joker reference).**\n\nSo let me impart to you some of my wisdom and knowledge as a finance major and risk management professional.\n\nHere's the rub. Is a crash going to happen? **Yes.**\n\nIs it the end of civilization as we know it? **No.**\n\nAre you going to be ok? **Maybe.**\n\nWe're a genuine conglomerate of retards. Some of us are figurative retards, others of us are actual retards. No disrespect to the actually mentally handicapped.\n\nTake the latest GME craze for example. We had folks yolo their literal life savings into this. I don't care if the price of this is ballooning into the tens of thousands... you NEVER invest all that you have into one single thing. Didn't you ever f\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* learn to not put all your eggs in one basket!?\n\nWe always joke about being apes, but even monke no touch poisonous snake...\n\nHere's what happens with crashes: the rich get bailed out by the taxpayer, the poor get absolutely destroyed, and the wise\/prudent get to keep their house and food on the table.\n\n**What you dipshits need is wisdom.** Are you living paycheck to paycheck? Stop buying useless shit you don't actually need. This isn't some r\/financialindependence circle jerk post, this is just basic common sense.\n\nSave your damn money, get yourself an emergency fund, cut back on your variable expenses, budget your money.\n\nThe people who actually get screwed in financial crashes are those of you who aren't prepared for one. Here's a tip: **THEY'RE ALWAYS GOING TO HAPPEN.**\n\nYou don't buy car insurance because you're terrified of driving, you buy it because you know the probability of getting into a crash isn't 0%, and you want to be covered in that eventuality.\n\nIt's the same with your finances. Risk is inherent to life. ***And the chances of a massive financial disaster is never 0%.***\n\nSo quit freaking out about a financial collapse, because it's always a certainty. What you need to do, is instead start preparing for one. If you were to lose your income tomorrow, would you have a six months breathing period? Would you be able to pay all of your bills for an entire six months and not starve?\n\nThis is what the majority of you new beautiful retards don't get. Those of us who have been in here since before 1,000,000 subs actually have our shit together. Most of us didn't start investing and \"yoloing\" until we had a 6 month+ emergency fund, or some sort of a financial parachute. And we never touch that fund, because as we saw with GUH-boy, things can literally go tits-up for no reason whatsoever, and next thing you know, your wife's boyfriend is jerking off to the loss-porn you posted because she's giving him blue balls just like you.\n\nThe spirit of WSB isn't trebuchet-ing your entire net worth into a single security and going full GUH when it inevitably goes tits-up, **it's taking the net-worth that you can afford to lose and yeeting it into gourd futures while still being able to feed yourself\/your family without having to suck dick behind a 7\/11.** So embrace your inner monke, but remember that even the dumbest of apes still know not to fuck with dumb shit...\n\n***TLDR; Financial crash is always a possibility. Don't be a dipshit. Prepare for one. Be smart with your money so you can eventually be dumb with it without losing it all because some WallStreet pricks ran out of devil's-dandruff to snort off of hookers and intentionally tank the economy.***\n\nObligatory *non-zero-amount* GME @ *$none-of-your-business* 1\/25\n\n\\*Not a financial advisor, but this is literally common-sense financial advice\\*  \n\n\nEdit 1: Forgot that car insurance is compulsory in the US.

(Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. I just casually trade on the occasion and like making money. I like this stock. I'm not asking for anyone to do anything. Just a discussion post seeing where people are.)\n\nSo as we all know, GME took a steep dive and today it dipped below $50. For me, my strategy was to buy in (as quickly as I could at the moment) and most likely sell at\/ past 500. The only problem? It never hit 500. Hell, it sunk like a tank. I held on because I was watching the news and reading our fellow retards in the chat as we were all holding till we die.\n\nWell, I'm almost dead.

Im gambling my last 1500 bucks on GME, but unlike some people, I know the only way it will hit the moon is if the moon crashes into the Earth, in a blazing ball of fiery glory.

Lets face up, once the people who bought in at semi reasonable levels wake up  and realized there wont be another short squeeze(and its debatable if there ever was one or it was just a retail buying frenzy), they are going to dump their stock to keep some of their money. Most retail traders who got in probably cant afford to piss away  money on stocks, and will want to preserve any gains they have or minimize any losses.\n\nNow that thats out of the way, its time to discuss my newly found trading strategy. After years of losing money, I noticed that when a stock moves sharply in a direction, the respective options increase in value, even if they are not in the money!

As a long time trader (who has witnessed a lot of halts), it seems far more likely that the brokers were at risk of getting fucked, and they protected themselves. But, I won't get into that, because that's not the point of this post.\n\nThis is the point:\n\nTHE STOCK MARKET ISN'T FAIR. Never has been, never will be. For example:\n\n1) Big money has access to so much information you don't have. They have access to order flows and shit that cost a fortune. They have entire departments and insiders that do nothing but research and investigate. Is that fair?\n\n2) Big money trades on platforms like bloomberg terminals (and similar), and they can literally see more accurate prices and trade quicker than you. Is that fair?\n\n3) Big money has access to advanced algos that you could never dream of accessing, that auto-trade for them. Is that fair?\n\n4) Big money has so much money that they can literally alter the prices of stocks by buying\/selling. They can rotate between stocks and ETFs that hold the stocks to remain invested while manipulating pricing. Is that fair?\n\nI could literally write a 500 point list, but my point is clear: the shit ain't fair. It's no secret. As a retail trader, you are a little guppy punk-ass bitch in a big dick shark pool.\n\n*But we all know that.* It's never been about being fair, it's about profiting from the landscape that we are in.\n\nIf you buy into GME at $50, and that shit goes to $500 in a matter of days, then you see some sketchy shit happening and think \"wow the hedge funds and market makers are gonna put an end to this shit...\" Then you hold until it crashes back down to $50 and cry \"it's not fair,\" then you're a fucking idiot. I'm sorry, but that's the deal.\n\nWe know big money has the power to crash a stock, so if you see it happening, sell. Better yet, sell and switch to shorts, and play both sides. Don't lose all of your money and then claim the market isn't fair. No shit it isn't fair. What's your point? Profit off that unfairness, ya dumb bitch.\n\nThe millions of new WSBers all posting about how \"it isn't fair\" and \"we got robbed,\" it's basically like a little bitch crime boss making a deal with the rival big dick crime boss, then crying because the big dick crime boss lied and stole his money. Hey, no shit. Criminals do that. If you're a crime boss, you know the other crime boss is probably fucking lying, so you hedge against his lies and use that shit against him. That's how it works.\n\nAnd that's how it works here, too. In the criminal world, people lie to you. In the stock market, big money manipulates shit. You can punch the sky, or you can accept that and play the game with those realities in mind.\n\nWhen I am in a trade, sure, I'm thinking about the fundamentals and future company performance. The news cycle. All the boring shit. But I'm *also* thinking about big money, retail traders, who is involved and how they are involved, and how all they will react to shifts in the stock price. You *have to,* because that's how the market ticks.\n\nYou only win by playing by the rules of the game, and the rules of this game are that the market is largely smoke and mirrors, and you'll never have even 1% of the knowledge or power that a typical hedge fund has. Don't fight it into bankruptcy like a fucking dongus. Play the game.\n\nAm I being negative? Nah, I'm being realistic. You want to fight to make the market more free and fair? Go on. Fight to make it better. It's a good thing to do, and I support it. And I'll help you.

It is what it is.\n\nAnd if you legitimately can't disconnect yourself from that idealism, then it's probably just best not to trade.

The typical prisoner's dilemma is set up in such a way that both parties choose to protect themselves at the expense of the other participant. As a result, both participants find themselves in a worse state than if they had cooperated with each other in the decision-making process. The prisoner's dilemma is one of the most well-known concepts in modern game theory.\u201d (Investopedia)\n\nApplying the prisoner\u2019s dilemma to what happened with GameStop is relatively simple. The best-case scenario (based on the stated goal) is for everyone to work together and \u201chold the line\u201d. This keeps the price of GameStop high and forces the hedge fund managers to lose money covering their shorts. On the other hand, the worst-case scenario is if no one buys or everyone sells their positions in a short period of time. This resorts in the shorts still being profitable for the hedge funds and ultimately the little guy has no impact on the market. Now what really happens, and what did, is that tons of people bought and held in the beginning, which is what shot the stock price to the moon. Now after about two weeks people started to bail, which represents the other two scenarios in the prisoner\u2019s dilemma. Where half of the party rats out the other half. With GameStop this is represented by some people starting to sell. The early sellers make most or all the profits leaving those who hold long term with a mostly worthless stock.","1089":"The GME Fever, and How Your Money Can Be Better Utilized Nobody is going to call you an idiot for holding Gamestop from $5 throughout this insane run up, thinking it will go higher. Because it did and no doubt there was a great bit of excitement. \n\nBut if you look at what's going on this week as far as volume goes, it has gone down. It seems like the stock is going to move much more slowly with a lot less investors with interest. Lots of big players exited their positions already and probably aren't looking to buy back in anytime soon. \n\nThose who are holding see a short squeeze as on the horizon. They see dollar signs. But how realistic is that really? We keep getting information that the next report is around the corner and the shorts will be revealed as being in a bad position. \n\nIt hasn't happened. It may not happen. And many of you are slowly losing interest. \n\nThis subreddit is called WallStreetBets for a reason. We make bets. Very rarely does the great group hold shares for a long period of time. Those of you who have Gamestop options expiring soon probably are sweating. And you should be. \n\nThe point I have to make is, anyone still in Gamestop, why? You could be making so much more money elsewhere. Those who saw the signs and moved to weed stocks made a bundle. Now, granted most were in before the latest weed run up, but the momentum traders among you still made a good bit of coin. Obviously the weed craze won't last forever, but if you momentum trade like the majority of the group here, you'd be in and out with profit. \n\nThe long and short of it is, your money could be better spent elsewhere, even if elsewhere is on YOLOs for options that are far OTM. \n\nThe original theory on Gamestop may have been moving in the right direction, but where are we now? We're at a stock that's pretty low volume, trading pretty flat, or downward depending on your perspective, on the way to a sub billion dollar market cap. \n\nI think all of our money can be better spent somewhere else.

Sorry if you're holding the bag, but there's no point.  The company doesn't have legs.\n\nWeed: This is a legitimate industry with very predictable, steady long term growth as more markets come online with easing laws and regs.   It's not going to grow much more in existing markets.  Weed is just weed.   You can only consume so much, and it's easy to get sick of it.   It has some limited medical uses, but it's not about to surprise us.   IOW, the long term growth potential is all priced in.   Boosting it was fun, but ultimately pointless, WSB has generated another bubble.  Don't get caught holding the bag here either.\n\nPsychedelics:   Ok this is a real opportunity.   The research on psychedelics is astounding.  It's effective in novel ways, providing profound relief from otherwise intractable conditions like major depressive disorder, and used in conjuction with therapy, is effective for helping people cope with PTSD, anxiety, and potentially many other emotional issues.   Unlike other medicines used to treat these conditions, it appears possible to deliver psychelic therapies with very minimal side effects.   As a psychologist, I am incredibly hopeful about the potential benefits it can bring with proper research and social acceptance.  As an economist, I see a world changing development that doesn't just boost the economy, but the well being of people as a whole.  Investing in pyschedics will actually help usher them into the mainstream, opening up more research opportunities and pushing back on the long-standing conservative stranglehold preventing us from discovering more about the potential for these drugs.  \n\nIn other words, it's good for a short term investment, it's great for long term investment, and it's a much more prosocial investment than say, tryiing to \"stick it to the big guys.\"  I recommend the ETF PSYK, and the company MMEDF Mind Medicine (MindMed) Inc.   Both are great entry points.\n\nThat's my two cents!","1092":"GME gang. Please let this subreddit be things other than GME. I was all in GME. Now I'm not.

That's the way this shit goes.\n\nI really hope you guys prove me wrong and make a 10 bagger out of GME still but we need to talk about the health of the sub. I am not Melvin captial just because I want to talk about other plays. I am not the illuminati cabel out to suck the tendies right out your portfolio.\n\nI just want to make money.

I cant stress enough the opportunities being LOST for real people, millions of people ON THIS SUB because a few bored cunts want to make this GME shit into something it's not. Even worse is that the real answer to the thing they claim to want is staring them right in the face.\nI'll explain \n\n    Fuck your shitdeology. Almost every post on GME is barely concealed garbage class warfare shit and is complete denialism almost entirely without any self awareness or actual real evidence. Or trash memes. (KINDA LIKE MOST OF THE STUFF ON THE REST OF REDDIT) What a shock! \n\nSave WSB please its been completely trashed for a month now. I remember when we would've been seeing dozens of posts about all the ERs going on. Instead its this garbage ideology shit masked as GME love. I made 100k off GME.

I only cared about hedgefunds involved because of the effect it had on the price and the early gamma squeeze that got it moving so rapidly. \n\nWe've got 7 million people who don't know a goddamn thing about economics or finance and only care about those subjects now because they've tricked each other by Circle jerking about how this GME shit is somehow a revolution. \n\nIf you care about that shit.

It can happen if.... if... IF you retards would stop being so self absorbed and in denial about GME and instead learn about the economics, the fundamentals, the financial institutions, instruments etc of how this shit works you could have your actual \"revolution\" your actual elevation of millions of people accessing \"rapid\" (but uneven) financial growth. \n\nInstead you just chant memes and pretend you're part of a cause by posting crap about HODL or whatever.

Then, the munchies kick in full force and you got to a Wendy's parking lot and jack off to a video of your wife flipping you off while riding a dong as least eight times longer than your 5 dollar inch long. There is a fucking bubble and you should get in. And it's a good long-term investment, so you should get in (none of this is financial advice, this is just me talking to myself in Reddit after taking anti-depressants from holding Gamestop).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Reason 1:** Everyone's a bull. The pigs and bears are dead because there's more money than what financial institutions know what to do with.\n\nRemember SPY puts? Remember printer goes brrrrrr? Remember how monetary policy produced some of the greatest loss porn we've ever seen. Gay bears is kill and the government has proven that they will probably prop up the financial system even if bubonic plague 2.0 happens. That money is still floating around with the Fed's finger on the trigger prepared to smack the equity markets back up. That money was invested into stocks like TSLA (which is the most beautiful and terrifying bubble I've seen in my life). That money will also make weed stocks as high as a kite. Discounted cash flows, betas, stock\/bond conflicts, and all that other stuff is irrelevant. Monetary policy is fundamental and will always save those who have money.\n\nThis is the new reality we live with. Like it or buy some guns, ammunition, and a lifetime worth of soylent and beyond meat and start your own 1 person country in the backass of nowhere.\n\nThere will be a bubble and it will pop. Do not be concerned about the pop until it appears imminent. And even if it does, I would still consider holding it for a delicious long play.\n\n**Reason 2:** APHA's balance sheet is robust. Doesn't show any signs of collapsing financially. Longevity in a new industry is golden.\n\n[https:\/\/www.marketwatch.com\/investing\/stock\/apha\/financials](https:\/\/www.marketwatch.com\/investing\/stock\/apha\/financials)\n\nInstead of getting high on their own supply when their stock soared as high as a kite, the comedown was harsh. But instead of getting rekt, they have been expanding rapidly regardless. Their sales have increased 142.34% in 2017, 80.62% in 2018, **542.28%** in 2019, and 128.73% in 2020. And considering that everyone's spending their stimulus money smoking weed and buying Gamestop, I do not see this trend stopping at any point. I've been to my local weed shop in CA and it's fucking packed every time I go in both pick ups and lines. I have to wait at least 45 minutes to get in.\n\nEven though the net income is concerning (it usually is for companies that grow rapidly due to the costs of expanding like a chad), the firm has a really large pillow to fall on. To be clear, for a company to be totally dead in the water, its equity (the difference between its assets and liabilities) goes to zero. APHA has 2.5 billion in assets and .7125 mil in liabilities. This is perhaps one of the reasons it gobbled up Tilray-- APHA recognizes it can increase its market share in an inevitable market place. This means that the company can continue its rapid expansion without worrying about defaulting. For reference, Amazon could afford to lose hundreds of millions of dollars from 2012-2015 because it has the assets to afford rapid expansion. We are looking at a potential hundred billion dollar company here as the marijuana industry consolidates into a few major players. APHA is likely to be one of those, as it has the durability and fundamentals to survive years of consecutive negative net income. APHA's largest expenses are \"unusual expenses,\" implying that they are really swinging for the fences with many one-time expansive purchases. \n\n**Reason 3:** Because of BLM and a decade of rising sentiment against the war on drugs, enforcing weed possession and sales laws are politically dangerous.\n\nYup. Nixon's law and order paradigm is falling out of the sky. Busting into people's apartments for a gram of weed and sentencing the occupants to 9 years in prison is not too popular. Even if marijuana legalization doesn't happen this or next or whatever, the tide has overwhelming turned against a \"tough on crime\" attitude toward non-violent drug use. This means that across the United States (and likely the world over the next decade or so), **weed will be effectively legal** over time even if it's not truly legal.\n\nPosition: 40 shares of APHA high as a motherfucking kite.","1097":"GME rest in peace. LGND new front runner for highest shorted stock Listen everyone, I know you retards are all holding GME as hard as your anal sphincters allow, but don't forget GME is still shit and you have to let it go at some point. I recommend you do it tomorrow at the open and grab LGND stock instead and here is why:\n\nWe always need a good reason for why we're investing. For the many who started sub $100 price point on GME, it was mostly because the short interest was through the roof at 140% when GME was at $5. That's fucking ridiculous. Because of that, there was strong potential for a short squeeze and a gamma squeeze even happened 1\/22. Big applause to the retards who won that and drove the price of GME past $100.\n\nHere is an example:  Melvin Capital closed their shorts on 1\/26 when GME was at $148. If they were shorting since at least the start of January when it was at $17, then they lost $17 sold - $148 bought = $131 for each shorted stock they had. They bought at 148\/17 = 8.7X how much they sold the stock for.\n\nUltimately, they motivated short holders to cover their position at a fat loss. However, shares short as a percentage of float still remained dummy high the same week. Why? Because new shorts came at higher price points of GME stock ($300+) than before. For those hedge fund institutions to be incentivized to cover their newer short position, GME would need to keep skyrocketing, at least into the $500 range to put pressure on their shorts at $300, and that isn't even 2x how much they sold the stock for. Remember, about 9X is when Melcin Capital finally threw in the towel.  If it does go that high and institutions do sell though, then they could  further carry it into who knows, maybe 1k+ where the moon awaits. Ok so if you're holding, goal is to get the stock to $500+ so that a short squeeze can happen. Remember, getting it to $500 won't happen because of a short squeeze.\n\nThis means that initial jump into a solid $500 stock price would need to be made mostly by retail investors, of which, have already invested into GME. Literally the WHOLE WORLD is on this boat including Europe and even China. Listen, if the hype was real enough to get global attention, that's the peak man! You're not gonna find more retail investors to jump onto the GME ship to carry it to $500+, there just isn't any more people. So, I don't think retail investors have the remaining capital to keep boosting GME stock price because its peaked its hype.\n\nStill thinking GME has dummy high short interest and you don't care about what i've just said? Think again, more than half the shorts were covered Friday\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/1vjhmhbcixe61.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ebdee3c6797eb0d2941d98f2991c29ce009e983\n\nWhat does this mean? If capital is all tied up and gme isn't moving up, people will sell. If they sell, you already know what that means... its over.\n\nSo to save my tendies and maybe yours, I'll be the first to say I sold my GME stock and moved it all into LGND. Wtf is LGND? Fuck if i know. But I do know (as far as my research goes) they're now THE MOST HEAVILY SHORTED COMPANY.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/g1bke9kgixe61.png?width=576&format=png&auto=webp&s=59909847a2ed8cba0924a8ff22b40d7d9ee23fb3\n\nThis was the whole reason why GME was a gem to begin with and it happened, that bitch mooned because we like the stock. But without the short position to help keep it bolstered, it doesn't have support like LGND does. The short position on LGND is at a super high 65% and most of those are from a month ago or before when the stock price was half. THIS MEANS THE SHORTS ARE PRIMED TO BE COVERED ALREADY! HOP THE FUCK IN BOYS. Positions = buy the damn stock.\n\nTLDR; GME is dying. I like LGND stock better\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: \ud83d\ude80LGND\ud83d\ude80\n\nTo the many of you still thinking GME shorts are high AF and over 100%, thats because the information you're getting IS NOT UP TO DATE. The stock exchanges releases short interest data once every two weeks for the public to see. I paid to see data daily. GME short interest has declined sharply because shorts were covered. Here is a link to an article with a different graph than mine, same conclusion: [https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2021-02-01\/gamestop-short-interest-plummets-in-a-sign-traders-are-covering](https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2021-02-01\/gamestop-short-interest-plummets-in-a-sign-traders-are-covering)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSecond edit: for anyone that listened, congrats you saved yourself from getting fucked by after hours on GME","1098":"Many ape bagholders Dont call urselfs diamond hand gme apes.\n\nCall yourself trash hand gme bagholders.

A cash infusion like this could have kept the company afloat for years.\n\nRegardless of how you feel about the future of $GME, the fact remains that the BoD essentially sat on their hands and watched tens of millions of dollars sail away from them. Why?? Were they worried about an SEC investigation? Securities fraud? Concerned about driving the price back down? Someone with a financial background, please help me out, I am genuinely confused about this.","1100":"How Did You Think This Was Going to End? Every single parabolic move (except TSLA so far, shout out Elon) has ended the same way: exponential up, exponential down. You philosophy guys may have heard of Occam\u2019s Razor: The simplest explanation is usually correct. \n\nGameStop had one of the craziest rallies of all time, $2.57 last summer to $500. The popular opinion is \u201chedge funds manipulating the price down\u201d right? Well GameStop is down 65% from the peak last week, and a lot of you will baghold to the ground. Here\u2019s the simplest explanation: Initial short squeeze blew up several funds (RIP Melvin), guys who got in early used the hype as an exit opportunity, new shorts entered near the peak, and the 5 million new kids here listened to Dave Portnoy and bought the top bc diamond handz. \n\nIt\u2019s not manipulation when a stock that ran up 2000% in a week pulls back, it\u2019s mean reversion. The manipulation was what we did pushing it all the way to $500 and wrecking shop on the way. \n\n\u201cBut the VW chart from 09!\u201d This isn\u2019t VW. Porsche cornered VW shares by itself and refused to sell. They controlled that squeeze single handedly. There have been 100M shares trading daily, you really think everyone here is actually holding? If they were the price never would have dropped back below $400. Smart money took profits and everyone else is holding out of hope. Hopium is a dangerous drug.\n\nHow did you think this would end? Obviously profit taking would come eventually, and it looks like it hit at $500. Posting a screenshot of your 5 shares and a \ud83d\udc8e\u270b\ud83c\udffc meme won\u2019t hold the price up forever. The real winners got in early and took profits as the media caught on.\n\nThis is the stock market. You come here to make money. You buy low and sell high. If you refused to sell bc you believed the hype, that\u2019s on you and you alone.

I don\u2019t like seeing losses, I want everyone to win. But when you refuse to take profits or acknowledge a potential top, it\u2019s on you 100% to eat the losses.\n\nThe same guys crying market manipulation now were buying SPY puts out of spite in March.

You trade what happens.\n\nFor the new guys here, remember this lesson next time you chase a name you read online. Diamond Hands are for losers. Take profits and compound.","1101":"Tuesday BB, BBBY, PLTR, GME Morning Gamma Update **TLDR: Gamma drives market makers \/ option dealers to buy\/sell stock in the same direction as the price action. It's dominating movements in most meme stocks presently. GME likely more dominated by capital inflows this week than short-term gamma (new buyers + short covering vs old sellers), but significant Friday unwind possible at very high price levels (over $115 specifically)**\n\nFinally got good data on option OI this morning. I think GME may be greatly understated on these charts.\n\n[https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/ZsyuYWu](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/ZsyuYWu)\n\nI added a new chart today from SpotGamma. Their product is really great, love it a lot. You have to add the put and call lines together to see dealer behaviors. As you go up in price, they are buying more, so it's kind of inverted in buying effects.\n\nGME: Gamma dominated recently, and gamma dominated in coming months. Less so today at these prices. Gamma ramp falloff after 115, big danger at 60 - sharp ramp. Less volatile  before 110 and after 65 or so. I think spot gamma is slightly understating the total gamma at risk here and think dealers own more.  Additionally, GME has substantial expirations on friday which could cause a meltdown in some scenarios. I don't think that is in the interests of dealers though, so maybe it's more gentle and doesn't drop past 60. In an event that the price absolutely collapsed, they'd lose money.  **But - Really, buying inflows are dominating this as much as gamma is. A lot could happen for bulls or bears here, and the short squeeze is a thing this week and also can have very large imapct, on the order of gamma possibilities or more.**  **I think most price action of this stock to the upside has to be short covering, further retail buying - NOT gamma this week.** there\u2019s also a dehedging of Friday expiry that will happen throughout the week and will cause things to move, I\u2019ll calculate. Options 30 and 40% out of the money are adding real delta right now. Wow.\n\n**EDIT 12:11pm NY Time Tues: GME Unwind Data:** At the current price of $89, dealers are holding about 6.5m shares long to hedge friday. As we approach Friday, this number drops to about 4.5m, causing weak selling at this price. Once Friday is over, at this price, those 4.5m shares get rolled or sold, which is some moderate selling. At a price of $110, there's buying of about 1.5m shares, followed by a rolling\/selling of 8m shares friday. At a price of $59, dealers-shift hedges at 6m shares sold between now and friday, and then friday unload is neutral. In other words, for the price range we are in, there's very slight dealer selling over time. As price goes down, that accelerates even if the price is flat, and friday starts to be a net buy by dealers on friday towards close under 60. For prices over 110, dealers start to net buy leading into friday, then have a large net sell\/roll into close. For insane prices, like $120+, dealers hold 11m shares going into friday, which roll off or are delivered or sold. Therefore, in most cases, **Friday unwind is moderate in scope, not large, being half the size of the stack that unwound 2 weeks ago and caused a 10% down day. The entire option stack is loaded however, per the chart. If price is $116+, the unwind is more potent and is similar to 2 weeks ago.**\n\n**PLTR**: Heavy gamma influenced, but less than some of the other stocks. More downside than upside with gamma, but an OK ramp up, not great.\n\n**BBBY**: Gamma dominated. More ramp down than up. Danger in that ramp from 30 to 20. Yikes\n\n**BB**: Gamma influenced, but not dominated, OI is smaller relative to float. Healthy ramp up.\n\n**Edit: After Close Tuesday GME:** My analysis is this looks like primarily new money. Gamma should've only been 8 million shares between open and $120, then a mere trickle after that. I'm sure you guys added some options, so call it 10 or 11. That does mean dealers now have perhaps as much as the float in shares, which is an interesting situation. After that, it was pure retail inflows, likely on the order of over a billion dollars. I think some shorts covered, but borrowdesk had no shares last I checked, so it looks like lots of people short.  Obviously, no one can predict where this can go, but per my prior comments, we are now in a bubble phase. Bubbles pop when capital inflows flip. Lifting each $10 takes the same amount of capital as the last $10, probably a few hundred million dollars per $10 rise, so % changes get harder. Are we at peak inflows today? No idea. But you can cross gamma off the table for now. Gamma isn't driving this right now at these price levels, inflows are driving this. I don't think short covering is a factor because while some shorts are covering, shares still hard to borrow. \n\n*My positions: was short GME but option OI not juicy enough, so left position. Will enter put spreads if prices are higher ahead of friday, will enter long if prices very low like under $60. Long BB. Long BBBY. Long PLTR via an indirect vehicle. Betting on WSB continue gamma stuff basically.*","1102":"GameStop-Heavy ETF Shrinks Sharply Amid Redemptions -- Barrons.com  \n\nThe GameStop(GME)-heavy  SPDR S&P Retail ETF shrunk considerably in size Wednesday as authorized  market makers redeemed about 70% of the shares outstanding of the  exchange-traded fund. The shares outstanding stood at around 2.4 million at the close of trading  Wednesday, down from 8.15 million on Tuesday. The fund size stood at about  $237 million, according to State Street Global  Advisors, which oversees the ETF . The market makers delivered more than 5.5 million shares of the ETF to  State Street Global Advisors and received the shares of the 95  companies in the ETF including GameStop(GME) , which represented 19.9% of the ETF  at the close of trading Wednesday. ETF shares can be redeemed or created at the  request of market makers. It's not clear why there was such a big redemption of the fund on  Wednesday. The XRT ETF was up nearly 2%, to $93.30, in early trading  Thursday after rising 12% Wednesday as GameStop(GME) surged 134%. GameStop(GME) was up about 9%, to  $379, in volatile early trading Thursday. The ETF is up 43% this  year with GameStop(GME)  accounting for about 64% of the advance. GameStop's (GME) 19.9%  weighting in the ETF is up from about 1.5% at the start of 2021, thanks to the  surge in GameStop's(GME)  share price from around $18 on Dec. 31. But its weighting in the ETF is due to fall sharply in mid-March, when the  fund undergoes its quarterly rebalancing. The ETF is equal weighted, meaning that the 95 components are rebalanced  quarterly to each have a roughly 1% weighting. The fund's objective is to  provide broad exposure to the retailing sector. The quarterly rebalancing occurs on March 19 -- the third  Friday of the final month of the quarter, according to S&P Dow Jones  Indices. That means that GameStop(GME) could be a major driver of the ETF  for weeks to come. When the rebalancing occurs, the ETF would sell enough GameStop(GME) stock to bring its  weighting down to 1%. The next largest components of the ETF after GameStop(GME) are Blink Charging(BLNK) and Magnite(MGNI) at around 1.5%.

Think about it: everyone always asks \"why didn't the shorts cover at $3?\" From the outside it looks like pure greed but as another one of the endless GME posts pointed out, these institutions aren't fucking stupid. They don't just \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50 their profits and watch them go to 0 like we do. And if they actually were getting fucked, they would have covered a while ago.\n\nMy theory is that when GME went to its lows, the shorts essentially saw this as a gift from the gods. They were expecting GME to go to 0 in the next 5 years, not in 1. So they most likely saw that there was immense upside and instead of simply covering, they leveraged themselves to the tits with calls just like u\/deepfuckingvalue, essentially creating a hedge for their short position. They knew GME would have a rebound in this covid economy and they basically shilled it on retail to make fat stacks. Once their calls print, they will own millions of shares which they can use to cover. After seeing Cohen's plan for the company they might even short it the fuck down again.\n\nTLDR shorts aren't getting fucked, they're reaping in tendies from both directions","1105":"Why your GME losses have nothing to do with Robinhood Before you downvote me to hell, no I don't use Robinhood because they don't support cost basis tax optimizations and other features like IRA accounts. I'm just tired of the daily posts crying about wsb tendies being stolen by Robinhood.\n\n**You really want to know who stole your tendies?** Look at every single gain post on the front page. How the fuck do you think those users realized their gains? By SELLING their thousands of shares and call options and driving the price down. This is the nature of a short squeeze - it's just a pyramid scheme and the truth is that the all of the people buying in at the top are getting fucked. \n\n\nNow I know you retards can't do your own research so here's a FAQ to answer all your conspiracy theory questions:\n\n\n\n**Why did Robinhood only restrict buy orders?**\n\nFirstly, this is false. Robinhood paused *opening positions*. So if you were short GME (or short put options), you could close your position by buying back GME or buying back your put option. So why is closing positions OK but opening positions is not? Because closing a position is a reduction in risk (since you have realized your gain\/loss) while opening positions is an increase in risk - something that the clearinghouse factors in when it calculates the broker's collateral requirement.\n\nSecondly, if Robinhood had restricted closing positions as well, I'm 100% sure you retards would be complaining about not being able to sell on GME's second highest peak day.\n\n**If I bought GME shares using cash, why did Robinhood have trouble posting collateral to the DTCC?**\n\nFirst off, it's illegal for brokers to use cash from customers to post collateral. Secondly, the DTCC unilaterally raised the collateral requirement for both shares and options above its normal requirement (the exact percentage is confidential but will be revealed in the congressional hearing). And finally, trading volume *more than doubled* in a single day from January 26th - January 27th (most of this increase is due to trading on Robinhood). So Robinhood not having enough cash to cover a more than 3X increase in collateral is perfectly reasonable. If you have a 3k mortgage payment every month and one month your bank says you now owe 9k, how many of you would be able to pay up? Robinhood's decision was basically between restricting a stock that less than 10% of users on Robinhood own or shutting down for the rest of the week, if not longer, because it longer has its primary clearing house to settle any trades.\n\n**Robinhood earns money from Citadel and Citadel bailed out Melvin Capital and even my smooth brain can connect the dots**\n\nYou're legitimately retarded if you actually think Citadel called up Robinhood to perpetuate market manipulation. Ah yes, Citadel pays quants 400k+ a year to come up with alpha generating strategies but the only way they can make money is to call up a broker and commit market manipulation in the most easily traceable way ever??? \n\nI actually don't understand the logic here. Your theory is that Citadel needed Robinhood to bail them out of their short positions. And yet the day after Robinhood lifted restrictions, short interest *increased* back to pre-restriction levels. **Why the fuck would hedge funds commit market manipulation to get out of their short positions, only to double down on more short positions the day after??**\n\n**Robinhood restricting opening long positions caused GME to tank I'm fucking poor now fuck Robinhood etc.**\n\nIf you graph Robinhood's restrictions against the price of GME, you actually get an inverse correlation (r^2 = -0.73). That is, when Robinhood first introduced restrictions, GME had its second best trading day. Then every day following, as Robinhood reduced restrictions, GME price fell lower and lower. What does this mean? Robinhood adding restrictions is not the reason why GME is tanking.  \n\nSo why is it tanking? Short squeezes are basically a pyramid scheme. The people at the top are the people that got in early. Then as the hype builds, more people join the bottom of the pyramid. That influx of new retards is the ONLY thing that is supporting the upwards price movement because the company has zero fundamentals. Finally there comes a point when enough people at the top cash out their massive positions and at the same time new people aren't joining the hype quickly enough (realistically, who the fuck is buying 420 shares when the price is $300+). And everything comes crumbling down. \n\nSorry to shatter your rosy perception of wsb, but you have to realize that every post telling you to \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c when the stock was 300+ was a massive fucking bait. Cramer pointed this out and advised everyone to cash out while we were ahead but you guys roasted him to fuck for it. It's only sad that you guys now choose to pin this on Robinhood, the company that made the entire squeeze and this very sub possible in the first place.\n\n**tldr** you guys are fucking retards that bought into a pyramid scheme and now blame Robinhood for being unable to keep up with your chain inting.","1106":"GME is a trap. Citadel will make the real trade I keep getting banned, I keep getting laughed at. But GME is a trap. Maybe Melvin \"closed\" the short position, but in all likely hood it was taken on by citadel. This is why the short interest remains.   \n\n\nDo some reach on Citadel, they are the masters when it comes to lending and the fixed income space. Right now they are buying up all of the GME fixed income notes. Once Citadel has cornered that side of the market, they will politely encourage GME to issues shares at these record high prices to pay down the debt. The higher the stock goes now - the more citadel will make once the float normalizes via their short. The fixed income trade is easy, risk free money.   \n\n\nCitadel will make money both ways, they will own free bonds, and their inherited short is going to zoom. I know no one wants to sell, but this is not going to end well.   \n\n\nPositions:   \nGME July Put $15  \nGME Jan  Put $27  \n\n\nBTW - these positions are zooming today as the smart money gets in on the trade.","1107":"PSA: the market does not care about your feelings, fairness, or even legality We have gained so many new people over the past week, I feel like this needs to be said.\n\nGameStop is falling.

If it\u2019s done illegally, they\u2019ll get a slap on the wrist, a 1-10mil fine, and chalk it up as a net gain vs what they would have lost.\n\nRobinhood and other brokers rigged the game against us, and that\u2019s it.

When RH shut it down, then cut it back, lets put aside why, they cut of the greatest source of demand. They created a RobinHood Dive. No RH buyers, means sellers lower their price to find buyers. And they keep on lowering it till they find buyers. Keep the most natural buyers out of the market and the price keeps on FALLING.*\n\n*Then that drop accelerates because the more the stock falls the more owners who bought on margin get margin calls.

Everybody is optimistic about GME and I am and have been since I got in at $15. I got out at $60 but my risk tolerance isn\u2019t super high so I\u2019m fine with it and enjoying watching all of the gains from the sidelines.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to rain on the parade but I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about VW, AMC, and GME and their short squeezes. Until this week, and specifically today, I\u2019ve basically been of the mind set that GME is a real squeeze and the others (AMC, etc.) are not. But today I\u2019ve changed my opinion. Please hear me out because I think there is a lot of logic to this.\n\nTHE SQUEEZE SQUOZE, NOW IT\u2019S SIMPLE SUPPLY DEMAND\nRyan Cohen and GME ruling out bankruptcy are what caused the squeeze. Plain and simple. They created a better outlook and higher genuine value for the company. This gave us a little squeeze forcing shorts to move from their ~140% to ~120% short interest today.\n\nNow that that squeeze occurred and they had to deal with raised price targets, we are simply dealing with very low supply. Shorters are not buying to cover really and lots of retards are buying creating upward movement a momentum. Not much supply. So right now there is no squeeze going on and we are all very dependent on stock lenders margin calling the shorts.\n\n\nTHIS ISN\u2019T VW\nJust wanted to add a short section here since this event does seem to be the inspiration we all draw from. In this case the shorts did get fucked and got margin called. The lenders did this because there was genuine concern that they would not get there stock back since there is 13x more shorted than there was available. If you buy that 1% and give it back to a lender you have 12% more to go, then you have to buy that 1% from that lender you just got it from, but what if they won\u2019t sell? There was genuine concern from lenders they would never get their shares back. Total loss.\n\n\nTHESE SHORTS WONT BE MARGIN CALLED ANY TIME SOON\nAs it currently stands the shorts are paying 30% APR on tens of billions of dollars to the lenders with VERY LITTLE risk in the long term that they will not be able to get the shares back as EVERYBODY (even is, mind you) expects the shares to go back down a lot after this is said and done.\n\nSo from a lender\u2019s perspective, would you rather call your shares back and end the party with huge yearly returns? Or would you rather drag this on for as long as possible and collect fees from shorts? The shorts will happily do it because they don\u2019t want to lose their shirt, they would rather pay the premium. And even if they did call their shares back, the market would explode and crash before they even had them settled.\n\nReally in the end, we are giving Melvin and the other shorts more time to adjust their position to a more favorable one before it comes back down. So in the end, unlike your believe that bears are fuk, it is retail investors that may be fuk.\n\n\nCAN GME SQUEEZE HARDER?\nI would say probably not soon. It could go higher if people keep buying and holding, but again, in the end retail might end up paying.\n\nThe one opportunity I do see would be a share vote or something else that could cause shares to be recalled. But that is unlikely and might not even happen at the yearly investor meeting.\n\n\nHOW TO MAKE MONEY ON THIS\nHonestly without lucky timing retail investors may be fucked here. Premiums on puts make it practically impossible to profit.\n\nWHAT ABOUT THE OTHER SQUEEZES?\nSimilarly to the current state of GME, we are driving price up and giving shorts better entry and lenders fat APR.\n\nTL;DR: this may be the best trick Wall-street ever played on us. Play acting that they are losing money and Robinhood is their martyr.\n\nEdit: Thanks for commenting everybody. After this interaction I think the squeeze could work out, but it would take insane diamond hands and\/or some strong buy pressure. Time and high borrow rates need to ware them down to be sure that this squeeze happens.","1112":"[GME] Why I feel less optimistic after Friday Please don't lynch me.

I'm mostly looking for people to tell me why I'm wrong because all the posts I see are full of shit and are so overly emotional that they seem to lack any kind of logic. Everyone was saying there will be a short ladder attack before close, there wasn't. Everyone was saying there will be a gamma squeeze if we close over 320 and there wasn't. Friday was the first time when I didn't feel I understand what is actually happening - does anybody? Something feels off and we might even have been lead into a trap by Melvin or other hedge funds for them to recoup their losses, So please hear me out first.\n\n(1) Public attention hit its maximum on Friday after being already extremely high on Thursday. It will likely subside rapidly next week especially if we have big dips.\n\n(2) Most calls in the money were probably bought by people who actually don't have the funds to cover them. AH, suddenly 4 million shares were traded (after 40 million) for the whole day, the price dropped rapidly. IMHO what happened is that RH automatically liquidated 40k calls ITM because the holders didn't have enough funds to exercise them (i.e. for a $115 call you need 11500 in your account). This freed up the need to hedge those shares and they were immediately sold.\n\n(3) Calls are now available up to 800 and they're actually not as expensive as you might think, so it's actually possible to hedge shorts quite effectively at this point. If the price doesn't hit $1000 soon, it will be very hard to squeeze. And we need to get there with buying shares only against people who can probably load up on shorts still and without the buying pressure of a squeeze and with considering (1).\n\n(4) Short interest might still be 120%, but these are now people that shorted between 400 and 500 and are already hedged with let's say 600 calls.\n\n(5) A squeeze to infinity would take down brokers and probably the entire market. Do you really believe this is going to happen? Don't be ridiculous. They can change the rules as they please and they did it before.\n\n(6) There are two many players involved now. Before it was an easy story. One hedge fund fucked up their risk management and redditors fuck with them. Now you have people who just FOMOed in and actually have no clue about the underlying squeeze and gamma squeeze theory (because IMHO it actually doesn't work anymore). You have other hedge funds for which I don't know if they're actually going for the squeeze or just trying to get as much money from retailers piling in. What if they loaded up on short all the time around 330, then let the price fall to 250 and buy back in just to give the illusion that retailers still control the situation? To me the price movements look extremely professional, this IMHO is not retail driven anymore. Even if they go for the squeeze. What tells you that they will not be the only one capitalizing on it leaving retailers holding the bag? They know the game 100 times better than any of you and _will_ screw you over.\n\n(7) We actually don't know who is short where and how it's hedged. Simple as that. Before it was Melvin shorted probably around 50 and in deep shit, now who the hell knows. We don't know if they actually covered. There's also dark pools btw. Just because volume was low is not a guarantee this didn't happen.\n\nI thought about this long and hard. Here are IMHO the possible outcomes.\n\n(A) People lose interest next week. The price will fall, people will panic sell. And a lot of you people will lose a lot of money you can't afford to lose. I feel extremely sorry about that because I really liked the movement.\n\n(B) The government will intervene and offer $10k to every GME holder per share to resolve the situation. The money has to be paid by Melvin, regulations will change etc. I think this is highly unlikely as it feels unfair to the people not joining.\n\n(C) The squeeze will go to infinity, each of you will be a billionaire and wallstreet will completely collapse together with the global stock market, because everyone in power who could have easily prevented it by just changing the rules will think it's time for a revolution and it would be unfair towards retailers to intervene. If you believe that, you are seriously retarded, and not in a good way.\n\n(D) The price will keep going up a little bit, but it's not a squeeze. It's orchestrated by hedge funds to make their money back from all the people piling in believing they are still fighting although the battle is already lost. Once they realize, people lose interest the price goes to zero and people will lose everything.\n\n(E) We will have more pressure and there's actually some squeezing going on. It could go to maybe 5000 before the government steps in, halts trading and most likely forces gamestop to dilute shares. Force because Gamestop really enjoys the attention and would draw a lot of hate doing this. But actually getting a lot of free money would probably be more attractive still, so they might do it even without being forced once they can negotiate a good deal with Melvin or whoever is interested to buy the shares at a reasonable price.\n\nDon't get me wrong. I believe in the movement and I'm immensely proud of everyone showing immense solidarity fighting the right fight, just don't be only led by your emotions, also stop to think and add some logic.\n\nI'm still long 100 shares, because I might be wrong, but I just feel after Friday the risk is significantly higher. Please safe, only invest what you're happy to lose (because this is the most likely outcome) and don't forget to try and understand what's actually happening.\n\nEdit: After thinking even longer and harder I now realize that the total amount of shares is super low and that's right there a good *logical* argument why after all this might work. None of you idiots pointed this out to me though. Good luck everyone. I'll hold my remaining shares, now that I have more than just an emotional reason. Thanks for all the thoughtful comments and insults. I also got added to the controversial club since apparently this thread was one of the most controversial in entire reddit \ud83d\ude02","1113":"\u2265100% SI is NOT conclusive proof of naked shorting Here's why.\n\nI'm fucking broke because I bought GME at $350 and \ud83e\uddfb\ud83d\udc50 on Tuesday. This means that when I run out of instant lemonade to snort and need more, I go get a grand from a payday lender. There is now $1,000 of debt (owned by the payday lender) and $1,000 of cash (owned by me). \n\nThe day after I take out my loan, my cousin Dan comes whining to me because his deathtrap beater broke down. (He shorted GME at $5 during the summer, so he's even more broke than I am.) Since I'm a sap, I loan him enough to get it fixed, say $500. Remember, I'm broke too, so that $500 comes out of the $1,000 I got from the payday lender.\n\nHere's the important part: There is still only $1,000 of cash ($500 owned by Dan, $500 by me), but the amount of debt has gone up to **$1,500** ($500 owned by me, and the original $1,000 owned by the payday lender). **This is not illegal**, or even against the rules (to a greater extent than that the payday lender will be squeezing my balls, so I have a strong incentive to get up Dan's ass about his share\u2014but at the end of the day that's a problem for the three of us and the local law enforcement couldn't give a shit).\n\n*Shares that are sold short are just shares to the people who buy them, so they can usually be borrowed and sold short again*. This makes it possible for a stock to have, in theory, infinity% SI without a single naked short existing. \n\nDo naked shorts of GME probably exist anyway? If the fail-to-deliver statistics that have been posted here are remotely accurate, I would lean strongly towards yes. Is it still retarded to short a stock \u2265100% of float (and will that probably produce a short squeeze)? Also yes. Does shorting still dilute the market and expose the shorter to significant risk even if it's not naked? Yes. But none of those mean you should go around stating GME's SI (real, theoretical, or historical) as any kind of proof that it's been shorted naked. Get better evidence and know what you're talking about.","1114":"Here's why GME will not recover over the next few months Here's why GME will not recover over the next few months.

I will start this DD by saying to those still holding GME, your awesome and I cheer your successes with it and support you in your losses. I know that many of you bought the stock b\/c you truly like the company and I honestly believe Ryan Cohen and his new pals will turn the ship around for GameStop, although believe that will take some time.\n\nI will try to keep this brief for all the apes \/ autists here but even YOLO plays should have some level of reason to them (maybe?).\n\nTLDR version -\n\n1. GME is better positioned for a SS 2.0 but AMC will likely benefit\n2. AMC is better fundamentally positioned as the economy re-opens and consumers migrate from video games to getting out and socializing at the movies\n3. AMC pre-pandemic was around $6 - $7 supporting the current buy point (although it may go lower as GME drags lower)\n4. AMC took advantage of it's rising stock price to eliminate some of its debt\n5. Whales believe in it's potential too - Dave Portney bought $700k worth of AMC yesterday\n\nAs of 2\/4, S3 shows 15.71% shares float short interest against AMC (44.68M out of 284.47M) vs 50.68% of GME (25.86M out of 51.03M float). This isn't public, I had to pay for this.\n\nShort interest is one thing, but lets compare that to daily volume.\n\nThe 20 Average Volume is 72.7 M for GME and 289M for AMC. AMC goes through 101.6% of it's float shares a day and GME goes through 142% of it's float across the 20 day average. This makes the short ratio (or days to cover) at 0.356 for GME and 0.155 for AMC which means that if a SS 2.0 were to happen it will more than likely happen for GME as the short positions on AMC could quickly be covered without causing much craziness. However, AMC's swings is heavily correlated to GME - see below.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Price Swing Between AMC vs GME across Short Squeeze](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/7gdp49o8djf61.png?width=2310&format=png&auto=webp&s=339dab698f0722a62b99e00b334cdd1e3dad88fd)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile correlation is not causation, it's likely that during a GME SS 2.0, this will greatly impact AMC. Furthermore, the AMC has not crashed as much as GME either having now overtaken it today in the upward direction. As GME continues to slide down amidst restrictions and scrutiny, all of the people that had 10x profit of their investment will began to recognize more and more how heavy \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c can be causing more sell-off reducing the impact of a SS 2.0 (e.g. if it falls to $30, I don't think SS 2.0 could take it above $90).\n\nI previously wrote a DD about how GME could be fundamentally worth $300, I think that will take quite a bit of time in re-inventing the company whereas AMC will benefit much more quickly than GameStop in the short-term. As the economy re-opens, people will be running away from video games to getting out and going to watch movies. The pre-pandemic price of AMC 2\/14\/20 was $7.10 which means that at the very least if it goes down by a lot more, it is likely to return to this level as the economy re-opens. In other words, AMC is on discount right now while GME will continue to be on discount for a while and continually increasing it's discount percentage (so you could make profits on AMC and then get GME for an even greater discount than currently).\n\nLong-term, I think AMC will continue to struggle as distribution companies look to release films through streaming platforms but for now as economic restrictions continue to lift and more people feel safer about getting out and about, AMC is primed for vast short-term success. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nFundamentally, this is safer than holding out for a GME SS 2.0 and still benefits from a GME SS 2.0 as well.\n\nAs of Q3 2020, AMC has a debt-to-asset ratio of 121.47% vs GME debt-to-asset ratio of 87.3%. However, AMC didn't start opening up theaters until Aug 20, 2021 which is 50 days closed out of 91 days of the quarter (e.g. they were open for less than half of the quarter) while continuing to pay for benefits to all of its employees. This bleeds through cash like a bullet wound to the aorta. As opposed to GameStop, they were able to open many of it's stores earlier in Q2 with eCommerce growth and continued Q3 debt-to-asset increase. That said, for Q4, many of AMC's theaters were open being able to start earning revenue and not just bleeding money.\n\nQ4's EPS estimate for AMC is -$3.68 EPS vs Q3 -$5.70. I actually believe it won't be as low and could be as high as -$3 EPS. The last year AMC was profitable was 2017 as people spend more time streaming movies than going to the movies, but the forecasted trend is still positive for AMC.\n\nThe major weight on a company's ability to overcome obstacles, such as a global pandemic, is having to take on debt. Debt can open lots of opportunities, but if it's a means to survive rather than grow, it really creates a burden. This is where AMC made a great move in my opinion over GME with converting it's debt to shares eliminating $600M worth of debt. While it has diluted the shares (and would have diluted GME shares too) reducing SS potential, it enhances the ability of the company to grow reducing that burden of debt.\n\nFinally, Dave Portney who said he was exiting all the meme stocks has went back into AMC by $700k - [https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/dave-portnoy-stakes-700k-amc-061244626.html](https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/dave-portnoy-stakes-700k-amc-061244626.html).\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80My price target for AMC is $30 within the year \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80. It's been there before and with bent-up demand, it has a lot more to gain than hoping for a GME SS 2.0.\n\nAMC is expected to report earnings on 2\/25\/21.\n\n**Note:** This will be my last DD post on this sub.

I wrote a post on r\/wsb noting I didn't think the stock was a long and it was removed! Now there's some Stalinesque behavior! In Soviet bubble, all stock must go up! Jokes aside, this $3 billion market cap \\[edit: now 6B\\] had $300m in cash flow at peak. I don't care that the stock has gone from 4 to 40--I'm interested in where it goes from here. A turnaround (can you call it that? a return to normal...) could bring cash flows to their old peak, but I suspect the continuing demise of retail and other headwinds probably make peak achievable cash flow closer to $200m. So, you're paying 15x for a turnaround\/return that hasn't happened yet. That's not outrageously expensive, but it's not for me. Plenty of cheaper stocks out there.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0One more thing--trying to game short-selling--a bit of a metamarket approach--rarely works in my experience. I've seen all kinds of \"squeezes\" like \\[CENSORED TICKER\\], Volkswagen\/Porsche, etc. While there are functional market mechanics that are worth knowing and watching, trying to 'battle' in the marketplace doesn't make sense. Look at HLF, etc. At the end of the day, the value of the company will be what matters, which is generally a function of the cash flow of the company. There are other dynamics, of course, that's what makes a good trader a good trader. I'd rather ignore that stuff and be a decent investor, since I think there is limited causal reasoning in the former. Intuition rules the trader, and we're in a very non-intuitive environment.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, I think GME is more of a long at $20 and more of a short at $60-80. No need to get upset about one's opinion. I have been around Internet message boards on stocks since they began, and geez, people get emotional, way more than r\/wsb. I have really ticked people off my entire life on stock message boards (and come to think of it... everywhere else) pointing out the obvious. See some old posts of mine on \\[CENSORED TICKER\\], CYTX, ONTY, NFLD and many more. All of those stocks disappeared with failure. GME is a real company with valueable assets.
